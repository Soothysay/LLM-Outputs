   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Hospital1 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR is likely
   contributing to her afib.
   - contact [**Name (NI) 10147**] for MVR
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - would avoid pressor if MAP>50 to avoid increased afterload which
   could make MR worse
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but this is likely a combination of
   afib with RVR, sepsis, and heart failure from severe MR (shown on TTE
   on [**2129-12-6**]).  She has WBC with significant left shift raising
   posibility of infection (sources include UTI and C diff). Hypovolemic
   shock was another possibility given her JVP was low and patient looked
   dry on exam on transfer to CCU, but currently she appears to be
   euvolemic.  TSH normal.  Pt is s/p RIJ placement on [**12-6**].  pt has
   peripheral vasodilatation on exam, indicating sepsis could play a role
   in hypotension.
   - place Swan ganz catheter, the numbers can guide us as to whether pt
   needs IABP or MVR
   - place A line
   - Treating infectious causes (see below)
   - continue to rate control Afib
   - f/u C diff
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn until culture data back
   - follow Lactate and UOP
   - f/u Random cortisol
   - follow CVP
   - hold off on fluids now that pt appears euvolemic, will give more IVF
   if CVP <12
   .
   #. Sepsis: Patient with hypotension, tachycardia, WBC with left-shift
   and UTI at OSH suggesting sepsis. However, patient afebrile, other
   explainations for hypotension and tachycardia, UTI has been treated and
   now UA is clean and blood cultures have been negative. Concern for
   endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF normal.  However, ESR
   elevated at 53.  Patient with elevated alk phos and GGT, question
   whether she has biliary obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or
   cholangitis, given her significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx
   negative so far, and pt has no abdominal pain.
   - Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn)
   - follow lactate and UOP  (goal 30cc/hr)
   - f/u Random cortisol
   - Daily BC
   - RUQ US today
   - consider pan-scan if pt tolerated lying flat
   - continue to trend
   - CIS
   - F/u UA & UC
   - F/u OSH micro
   .
   # RHYTHM: Afib with RVR.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is
   one possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is
   not significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue dilt drip, slowly wean down
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 QID
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - hold off on fluids now that pt appears euvolemic, will give more IVF
   if CVP <12
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 27.6 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection or other causes.  Diff showed immature myelocytes, so
   also question bone marrow abnormalities.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - RUQ US today
   - consider pan-scan if pt can lie flat
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain.
   - RUQ US today
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - hold off on fluids for now
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD.  Retic 1.5,
   indicating poor bone marrow response.
   - f/u  b12, folate
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs again today
   .
   #. Creatinine: unknown baseline; cr 1.2, eGFR of 46 ml/min currenlty.
   Urine lytes showed evidence of pre-renal physiology, but now pt appears
   euvolemic after 1L fluid boluses yesterday.
   - continue to optimize BP
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and mitral regurgitation (MR). She presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath, and was admitted to another hospital before being transferred to this ICU for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient continues to be hypotensive despite rate control, with increasing leukocytosis concerning for septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MR: The patient has a significant tear at the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR. This could lead to further cardiac dysfunction and heart failure symptoms.
2. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is unclear, but it is likely a combination of AFib with RVR, sepsis, and heart failure from severe MR. Hypovolemic shock was another possibility, but the patient appears euvolemic at the moment.
3. Sepsis: Despite treatment for UTI, the patient's WBC count is still increasing, indicating ongoing infection. Blood cultures have been negative so far, and there is concern for endocarditis, especially given the elevated ESR.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is climbing to 27.6, with immature myelocytes present,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, generalized weakness, and shortness of breath. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her heart failure and new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's symptoms, including weakness, edema, and shortness of breath, suggest congestive heart failure with a likely etiology of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation causing improper filling of the ventricle. She continues to be hypotensive despite rate control measures and is showing signs of septic shock. Her white blood cell count is elevated with a left shift, indicating a possible infection. The patient also has leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and a high ESR. There is a concern for endocarditis, but blood cultures are negative. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with hyponatremia and hypokalemia. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's history of chronic systolic CHF and current symptoms of weakness, edema, and shortness of breath point towards worsening heart failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's recent development of atrial fibrillation with RVR has led to hypotension and inadequate ventricular filling.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to Hospital3 and then transferred to Hospital11 for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR).

The patient's symptoms indicate congestive heart failure, likely due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation causing improper filling of the ventricle. She is experiencing hypotension, possibly due to a combination of afib with RVR, sepsis, and heart failure from severe mitral regurgitation (MR). There is also concern for urinary tract infection (UTI) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, as evidenced by leukocytosis with a significant left shift and positive blood cultures.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles, irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex, and 2+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a left shift, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT). Blood cultures have been negative so"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Hospital1 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR is likely
   contributing to her afib.
   - contact [**Name (NI) 10147**] for MVR
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - would avoid pressor if MAP>50 to avoid increased afterload which
   could make MR worse
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but this is likely a combination of
   afib with RVR, sepsis, and heart failure from severe MR (shown on TTE
   on [**2129-12-6**]).  She has WBC with significant left shift raising
   posibility of infection (sources include UTI and C diff). Hypovolemic
   shock was another possibility given her JVP was low and patient looked
   dry on exam on transfer to CCU, but currently she appears to be
   euvolemic.  TSH normal.  Pt is s/p RIJ placement on [**12-6**].  pt has
   peripheral vasodilatation on exam, indicating sepsis could play a role
   in hypotension.
   - place Swan ganz catheter, the numbers can guide us as to whether pt
   needs IABP or MVR
   - place A line
   - Treating infectious causes (see below)
   - continue to rate control Afib
   - f/u C diff
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn until culture data back
   - follow Lactate and UOP
   - f/u Random cortisol
   - follow CVP
   - hold off on fluids now that pt appears euvolemic, will give more IVF
   if CVP <12
   .
   #. Sepsis: Patient with hypotension, tachycardia, WBC with left-shift
   and UTI at OSH suggesting sepsis. However, patient afebrile, other
   explainations for hypotension and tachycardia, UTI has been treated and
   now UA is clean and blood cultures have been negative. Concern for
   endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF normal.  However, ESR
   elevated at 53.  Patient with elevated alk phos and GGT, question
   whether she has biliary obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or
   cholangitis, given her significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx
   negative so far, and pt has no abdominal pain.
   - Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn)
   - follow lactate and UOP  (goal 30cc/hr)
   - f/u Random cortisol
   - Daily BC
   - RUQ US today
   - consider pan-scan if pt tolerated lying flat
   - continue to trend
   - CIS
   - F/u UA & UC
   - F/u OSH micro
   .
   # RHYTHM: Afib with RVR.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is
   one possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is
   not significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue dilt drip, slowly wean down
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 QID
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - hold off on fluids now that pt appears euvolemic, will give more IVF
   if CVP <12
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 27.6 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection or other causes.  Diff showed immature myelocytes, so
   also question bone marrow abnormalities.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - RUQ US today
   - consider pan-scan if pt can lie flat
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain.
   - RUQ US today
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - hold off on fluids for now
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD.  Retic 1.5,
   indicating poor bone marrow response.
   - f/u  b12, folate
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs again today
   .
   #. Creatinine: unknown baseline; cr 1.2, eGFR of 46 ml/min currenlty.
   Urine lytes showed evidence of pre-renal physiology, but now pt appears
   euvolemic after 1L fluid boluses yesterday.
   - continue to optimize BP
   - Trend creatinine

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and transferred to this facility for management of her heart failure. Upon admission, she was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and a torn chordae at the tip of the posterior mitral valve leaflet with partial flail of the leaflet tip, leading to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient also has leukocytosis, hypotension, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis with a left shift, and a urinary tract infection at the outside hospital. Although the blood cultures are negative so far, there is a concern for sepsis. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued.
2. Endocarditis: Despite negative blood cultures and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), there is still a concern for endocarditis given the patient's significantly elevated white blood cell count and elevated liver enzymes. Regular follow-up of blood cultures and trend of inflammatory markers is necessary.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and her symptoms are consistent with worsening heart failure (shortness of"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to

   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, zosyn and flagyl) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR is likely
   contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - continue IABP support

   and UTI at OSH suggesting sepsis.  Also concerning for endocarditis,
   but negative blood cultures and RF normal.  ESR and CRP significantly
   elevated.
   - pan-scan pt today
   - Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl)

   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but this is likely a combination sepsis
   and heart failure from severe MR (shown on TTE on [**2129-12-6**]).  Pt has
   converted to sinus rhythm, so afib with RVR is not playing a role in
   this hypotension.  She has rising WBC with significant left shift
   raising posibility of infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia,

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who was admitted to the hospital for management of her heart failure and now presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She continues to be hypotensive despite rate control and has leukocytosis, raising concern for septic shock. The patient has respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary edema and pneumonia, and mitral regurgitation due to a tear in the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. She also has elevated inflammatory markers, suggesting possible infection or endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure. Pneumonia is also possible given the opacity in the left lower lobe. The patient had labored breathing on 12/7, and an arterial blood gas showed worsening oxygenation, leading to intubation on 12/7.

2. Mitral regurgitation: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation due to a tear in the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. This tear is likely contributing to worsening mitral regurgitation and heart failure. The patient's atrial fibrillation may also be related to the mitral regurgitation.

3. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis"

   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, zosyn and flagyl) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better

   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR is likely
   contributing to her afib.

   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but this is likely a combination sepsis
   and heart failure from severe MR (shown on TTE on [**2129-12-6**]).  Pt has
   converted to sinus rhythm, so afib with RVR is not playing a role in
   this hypotension.  She has rising WBC with significant left shift
   raising posibility of infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia,
   abdomen and C diff). Pt has peripheral vasodilatation on exam,
   indicating sepsis could play a role in hypotension.  s/p Swan ganz

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and recent symptoms of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. Additionally, the patient was intubated due to worsening oxygenation. This suggests the possibility of respiratory failure, potentially caused by pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

2. Mitral regurgitation (MR): The patient has a tear at the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, leading to severe MR. This can contribute to heart failure and may be related to the patient's current symptoms.

3. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated ESR and CRP, and a history of UTI. The combination of hypotension, tachycardia, and rising WBC count raises concern for sepsis, which may be secondary to a urinary tract infection or other sources.

4. Endocarditis: Although blood cultures are negative, the patient's elevated ESR and CRP suggest the possibility of endocarditis. A pan-scan is planned to further evaluate this.

5. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite rate control, and the etiology is unclear. Potential causes include sepsis, heart failure due to severe MR, or other factors such as medication side effects or volume depletion.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is rising, and there are immature myelocytes present, raising the possibility of a bone marrow abnormality or infection. Further evaluation is needed, including a peripheral smear and follow-up of blood cultures.

7. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm but then reverted back to atrial fibrillation. Infection and worsened MR are potential contributing factors.

8. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient has elevated alk phos and GGT levels, which may indicate biliary obstruction or cholangitis. However, RUQ US did not show significant abnormalities.

9. Anemia: The patient has normocytic, normochromic anemia with a normal RDW. Chronic diseases and ACD are likely contributing factors.

10. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is rising, suggesting acute renal failure, likely pre-renal due to hypotension and heart failure.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to optimize the patient's condition and provide appropriate care."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, zosyn and flagyl) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR is likely
   contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - continue IABP support
   .
   #. Sepsis: Patient with hypotension, tachycardia, WBC with left-shift
   and UTI at OSH suggesting sepsis.  Also concerning for endocarditis,
   but negative blood cultures and RF normal.  ESR and CRP significantly
   elevated.
   - pan-scan pt today
   - Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl)
   - follow lactate and UOP  (goal 30cc/hr)
   - follow venous O2 sats (goal >70)
   - follow CVP (goal [**7-18**])
   - Daily BC
   - CIS
   - F/u all cultures including c. diff
   - F/u OSH micro
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but this is likely a combination sepsis
   and heart failure from severe MR (shown on TTE on [**2129-12-6**]).  Pt has
   converted to sinus rhythm, so afib with RVR is not playing a role in
   this hypotension.  She has rising WBC with significant left shift
   raising posibility of infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia,
   abdomen and C diff). Pt has peripheral vasodilatation on exam,
   indicating sepsis could play a role in hypotension.  s/p Swan ganz
   catheter and A-line placement on [**12-7**].
   - continue IABP support
   - continue pressor (neo)
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl until culture data back
   - Treating infectious causes (see above)
   - f/u C diff
   - follow Lactate and UOP
   - follow CVP
   - hold off on fluids now that pt appears euvolemic, will give more IVF
   if CVP <12
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 27.6 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection or other causes.  Diff showed immature myelocytes, so
   also question bone marrow abnormalities.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - pan-scan
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion.  In terms of etiology of
   afib, infection is one possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened
   MR (although LA is not significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 QID
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - continue IABP support
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   - pan scan
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - hold off on fluids for now
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD.  Retic 1.5,
   indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate normal.  When
   IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: cr 1.2 on admission, rising to 1.6 today.
   Likely pre-renal given hypotension and heart failure.
   - check urine lytes
   - continue to optimize BP with IABP support
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

","The patient's medical history and current condition suggest multiple potential medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation (MR), which can lead to pulmonary edema and subsequent respiratory failure. Pneumonia is also a possibility given the opacity in the left lower lobe seen on the chest X-ray. The patient was intubated due to labored breathing and worsening oxygenation.

2. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, tachycardia, and leukocytosis with a left shift, indicating a possible infection. The elevated ESR and CRP levels further support the possibility of sepsis. The source of infection could be urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, abdomen, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

3. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, and her presenting symptoms were consistent with heart failure (shortness of breath, orthopnea, edema). The repeat TTE showed normal ejection fraction but significant MR, which can contribute to heart failure.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR): The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, which can worsen heart failure. The patient converted spontaneously to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful cardioversion.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is rising, with immature"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, zosyn and flagyl) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR is likely
   contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - discontinue IABP support
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (OSH cardiologist) re chronicity of MR and whether
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10146**] rupture is acute
   .
   #. Sepsis: Patient with hypotension, tachycardia, WBC with left-shift
   and UTI at OSH suggesting sepsis.  Also concerning for endocarditis,
   but negative blood cultures and RF normal.  ESR and CRP significantly
   elevated.
   - pan-scan pt today
   - Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl)
   - follow lactate and UOP  (goal 30cc/hr)
   - follow CVP (goal [**7-18**])
   - Daily BC
   - CIS
   - F/u all cultures including c. diff
   - F/u OSH micro
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but this is likely a combination sepsis
   and heart failure from severe MR (shown on TTE on [**2129-12-6**]).  Pt has
   converted to sinus rhythm, so afib with RVR is not playing a role in
   this hypotension.  She has rising WBC with significant left shift
   raising posibility of infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia,
   abdomen and C diff). Pt has peripheral vasodilatation on exam,
   indicating sepsis could play a role in hypotension.  s/p Swan ganz
   catheter and A-line placement on [**12-7**].  PE needs to be ruled out.
   - discontinue IABP
   - continue pressor (neo)
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl until culture data back
   - Treating infectious causes (see above)
   - f/u C diff
   - follow Lactate and UOP
   - follow CVP
   - will give pt 2u pRBC today
   - will rule out PE when pt renal fnx improves
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 27.6 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection or other causes.  Diff showed immature myelocytes, so
   also question bone marrow abnormalities.  Flu ruled out at OSH.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - pan-scan
   - rule out flu
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion overnight, but then went
   back to afib this morning.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is
   one possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is
   not significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt
   - restart dilt drip
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 QID
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - discontinue IABP support
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   - pan scan
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - will give blood today for volume repletion given that pt is possibly
   intravascularly dry
   - give NS if pt needs IVF
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD.  Retic 1.5,
   indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate normal.  When
   IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: cr 1.2 on admission, rising to 1.6 today.
   Likely pre-renal given hypotension and heart failure.
   - check urine lytes
   - discontinue IABP
   - pan scan
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and recent admission for generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was transferred to the ICU due to worsening heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient remains hypotensive despite rate control, with increasing leukocytosis, raising concerns for septic shock. She also has respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and pneumonia. Other potential complications include infection, bone marrow abnormalities, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has labored breathing and worsening oxygenation, indicating possible respiratory failure. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, tachycardia, and leukocytosis with a left shift, suggesting sepsis. Blood cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been started.
3. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has severe MR, which could be contributing to her heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Further evaluation of the mitral valve is recommended.
4. Infection: The patient has a high white blood cell count with immature myelocytes, raising the possibility of infection or bone marrow abnormalities. Blood cultures are pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
5. Liver Enzyme Elevation: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from volume overload in the setting of
   severe MR leading to heart failure.
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Hospital1 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR is likely
   contributing to her afib.
   - contact [**Name (NI) 10147**] for MVR
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - would avoid pressor if MAP>50 to avoid increased afterload which
   could make MR worse
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but this is likely a combination of
   afib with RVR, sepsis, and heart failure from severe MR (shown on TTE
   on [**2129-12-6**]).  She has WBC with significant left shift raising
   posibility of infection (sources include UTI and C diff). Hypovolemic
   shock was another possibility given her JVP was low and patient looked
   dry on exam on transfer to CCU, but currently she appears to be
   euvolemic.  TSH normal.  Pt is s/p RIJ placement on [**12-6**].  pt has
   peripheral vasodilatation on exam, indicating sepsis could play a role
   in hypotension.
   - place Swan ganz catheter, the numbers can guide us as to whether pt
   needs IABP or MVR
   - place A line
   - Treating infectious causes (see below)
   - continue to rate control Afib
   - f/u C diff
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn until culture data back
   - follow Lactate and UOP
   - f/u Random cortisol
   - follow CVP
   - hold off on fluids now that pt appears euvolemic, will give more IVF
   if CVP <12
   .
   #. Sepsis: Patient with hypotension, tachycardia, WBC with left-shift
   and UTI at OSH suggesting sepsis. However, patient afebrile, other
   explainations for hypotension and tachycardia, UTI has been treated and
   now UA is clean and blood cultures have been negative. Concern for
   endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF normal.  However, ESR
   elevated at 53.  Patient with elevated alk phos and GGT, question
   whether she has biliary obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or
   cholangitis, given her significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx
   negative so far, and pt has no abdominal pain.
   - Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn)
   - follow lactate and UOP  (goal 30cc/hr)
   - f/u Random cortisol
   - Daily BC
   - RUQ US today
   - consider pan-scan if pt tolerated lying flat
   - continue to trend
   - CIS
   - F/u UA & UC
   - F/u OSH micro
   .
   # RHYTHM: Afib with RVR.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is
   one possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is
   not significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue dilt drip, slowly wean down
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 QID
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - hold off on fluids now that pt appears euvolemic, will give more IVF
   if CVP <12
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 27.6 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection or other causes.  Diff showed immature myelocytes, so
   also question bone marrow abnormalities.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - RUQ US today
   - consider pan-scan if pt can lie flat
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain.
   - RUQ US today
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - hold off on fluids for now
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD.  Retic 1.5,
   indicating poor bone marrow response.
   - f/u  b12, folate
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs again today
   .
   #. Creatinine: unknown baseline; cr 1.2, eGFR of 46 ml/min currenlty.
   Urine lytes showed evidence of pre-renal physiology, but now pt appears
   euvolemic after 1L fluid boluses yesterday.
   - continue to optimize BP
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic systolic heart failure, bibasilar crackles, and the presence of a tear in the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve suggest a possibility of respiratory failure due to volume overload and severe mitral regurgitation (MR).

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis with a significant left shift, and previous urinary tract infection (UTI) at OSH raise concerns for sepsis. Although the patient is currently afebrile and blood cultures have been negative, the elevated ESR and significantly elevated WBC count indicate ongoing inflammation.

3. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is unclear, but it could be a combination of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), sepsis, and heart failure from severe MR. The patient's peripheral vasodilation on exam suggests that sepsis may also play a role in hypotension.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is climbing, indicating an immune response. The presence of immature myelocytes on the differential suggests a possible bone marrow abnormality.

5. Elevated alk phos and GGT: These findings raise the question of biliary obstruction leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis. However"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   #. Shock: etiology multifactorial from presumed sepsis and cardiogenic
   (acute MR, afib with RVR).  Low SVR, high CO, high mixed venous
   saturations suggest predominantly septic physiology.  Currently
   requiring multiple pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain
   MAP> 60.
   - cont phenylephrine, levophed to keep MAP > 60; consider adding
   vasopressin if necessary
   - wean IABP and pull today
   - d/c swanz-catheter and replace with triple lumen
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily blood cx
   - CT torso today if pt stabilizes
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV and PO vanc/ meropenem
   - consider r/o PE if condition does not improve
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: oliguric, cr 1.2 on admission, rising to 1.9.
   Likely pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following, patient will
   likely need CVVHD but family has decided to limit care.  Patient with
   volume overload, metabolic acidosis but no significant electrolyte
   abnormalities
   - discontinue IABP
   - pan scan
   - Trend creatinine
   - cont bicarb gtt
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10166**]
   infection  is likely contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - discontinue IABP support
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (OSH cardiologist) re chronicity of MR and whether
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10146**] rupture is acute
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 48.8 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia, abdomen and C diff)
   Also concerning for endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF
   normal.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Diff showed immature
   myelocytes, so also question bone marrow abnormalities. .
   Flu ruled out at OSH.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - heme consult for further evaluation possible malignancy
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - pan-scan
   - rule out flu
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion overnight, but then went
   back to afib yesterday.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is one
   possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is not
   significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - discontinue IABP support
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.
   - continue to trend

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires multiple pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. This suggests a state of shock, which may be due to a combination of cardiogenic and septic factors.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is oliguric with a rising creatinine level, indicating possible acute kidney injury. This could be due to pre-renal causes (such as hypovolemia) and/or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of pulmonary edema and is currently intubated for respiratory failure. There is also an opacity in the left lower lobe of the lung on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible pneumonia.

4. Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient has a tear in the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, leading to significant MR. This can contribute to heart failure symptoms and may be a result of chronic mitral valve prolapse.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection. Sources of infection could include urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, abdominal infection, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

6. Endocarditis: Although blood cultures have been negative so far, the"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure who presented to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has been in the ICU for approximately one week and has been on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with an increase in the need for pressors, oliguria, and worsening renal function. The patient also has a fever and increased lactate levels, indicating possible sepsis. The patient's family has made the decision to be do not resuscitate (DNR). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated lactate levels, and worsening renal function suggest possible sepsis. Prompt management is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria, elevated creatinine levels, and low urine output indicate potential AKI. Continued monitoring and appropriate management, including fluid resuscitation and possibly renal replacement therapy, may be necessary.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of chronic heart failure and current hemodynamic instability, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamics, along with aggressive management of fluid balance and inotropic support, is essential.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, elevated white blood cell count, and findings on chest imaging raise concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but there are several significant events that occurred within the last 24 hours. 

1. Pressor requirement increased (neo+levophed): This indicates that the patient's blood pressure is still unstable and requires additional medication to maintain adequate blood flow.

2. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC), normal saline (NS), and bicarbonate, suggesting ongoing efforts to improve intravascular volume and correct metabolic acidosis.

3. The patient is oliguric, meaning low urine output, with a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0.1%. The osmolality is 334, which is consistent with mixed pre-renal and intrinsic renal injury. This suggests that the kidneys are not functioning properly due to both inadequate blood flow and intrinsic kidney damage.

4. A pan-scan is undecided due to the patient being too unstable to leave the floor. This implies that imaging studies may be necessary for further evaluation, but the patient's critical condition makes it difficult to perform these tests at this time.

5. The patient's family meeting was held, and they made the decision to make the patient do not resuscitate (DNR).

6. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows more acidosis and rising lactate levels, indicating worsening tissue perfusion and oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   #. Shock: etiology multifactorial from presumed sepsis and cardiogenic
   (acute MR, afib with RVR).  Low SVR, high CO, high mixed venous
   saturations suggest predominantly septic physiology.  Currently
   requiring multiple pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain
   MAP> 60.
   - cont phenylephrine, levophed to keep MAP > 60; consider adding
   vasopressin if necessary
   - wean IABP and pull today
   - d/c swanz-catheter and replace with triple lumen
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily blood cx
   - CT torso today if pt stabilizes
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV and PO vanc/ meropenem
   - consider r/o PE if condition does not improve
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: oliguric, cr 1.2 on admission, rising to 1.9.
   Likely pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following, patient will
   likely need CVVHD but family has decided to limit care.  Patient with
   volume overload, metabolic acidosis but no significant electrolyte
   abnormalities
   - discontinue IABP
   - pan scan
   - Trend creatinine
   - cont bicarb gtt
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10166**]
   infection  is likely contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - discontinue IABP support
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (OSH cardiologist) re chronicity of MR and whether
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10146**] rupture is acute
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 48.8 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia, abdomen and C diff)
   Also concerning for endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF
   normal.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Diff showed immature
   myelocytes, so also question bone marrow abnormalities. .
   Flu ruled out at OSH.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - heme consult for further evaluation possible malignancy
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - pan-scan
   - rule out flu
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion overnight, but then went
   back to afib yesterday.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is one
   possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is not
   significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - discontinue IABP support
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   - pan scan
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - will give blood today for volume repletion given that pt is possibly
   intravascularly dry
   - give NS if pt needs IVF
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD s/p 2 UpRBC.
   Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate
   normal.  When IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to Hospital 3 and later transferred to Hospital 11 due to worsening heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient continues to be hypotensive despite rate control and has increasing leukocytosis, suggesting septic physiology.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing multifactorial shock, likely due to sepsis and cardiogenic causes (acute mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response). She requires multiple pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg, and consideration may be given to adding vasopressin if necessary. The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) should be weaned and pulled today. A triple-lumen central venous catheter should replace the swan-ganz catheter, and the CVP should be monitored (goal > 10, fluid bolus as needed). Mixed venous saturation should be monitored (goal > 70%), and lactate and urine output should be trended. Daily blood cultures should be obtained, and a CT torso should be performed if the patient stabilizes. Empiric antibiotic coverage with intravenous and oral vancomycin/meropenem should continue, and a pulmonary emb"

   organomegaly.  No evidence high grade obstruction or perf
   Doppler U/S:

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Patient with hypotension, tachycardia, WBC with left-shift
   and UTI at OSH suggesting sepsis.  Also concerning for endocarditis,
   but negative blood cultures and RF normal.  ESR and CRP significantly
   elevated.
   - pan-scan pt today
   - Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl)
   - follow lactate and UOP  (goal 30cc/hr)
   - follow CVP (goal [**7-18**])
   - Daily BC
   - CIS
   - F/u all cultures including c. diff
   - F/u OSH micro
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, zosyn and flagyl) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR is likely
   contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - discontinue IABP support
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (OSH cardiologist) re chronicity of MR and whether
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10146**] rupture is acute
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but this is likely a combination sepsis
   and heart failure from severe MR (shown on TTE on [**2129-12-6**]).  Pt has
   converted to sinus rhythm, so afib with RVR is not playing a role in
   this hypotension.  She has rising WBC with significant left shift
   raising posibility of infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia,
   abdomen and C diff). Pt has peripheral vasodilatation on exam,
   indicating sepsis could play a role in hypotension.  s/p Swan ganz
   catheter and A-line placement on [**12-7**].  PE needs to be ruled out.
   - discontinue IABP
   - continue pressor (neo)
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl until culture data back
   - Treating infectious causes (see above)
   - f/u C diff
   - follow Lactate and UOP
   - follow CVP
   - will give pt 2u pRBC today
   - will rule out PE when pt renal fnx improves
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 27.6 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection or other causes.  Diff showed immature myelocytes, so
   also question bone marrow abnormalities.  Flu ruled out at OSH.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - pan-scan
   - rule out flu
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion overnight, but then went
   back to afib this morning.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is
   one possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is
   not significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt
   - restart dilt drip
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 QID
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - discontinue IABP support
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   - pan scan
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - will give blood today for volume repletion given that pt is possibly
   intravascularly dry
   - give NS if pt needs IVF
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD.  Retic 1.5,
   indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate normal.  When
   IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: cr 1.2 on admission, rising to 1.6 today.
   Likely pre-renal given hypotension and heart failure.
   - check urine lytes
   - discontinue IABP
   - pan scan
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure presenting with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and then transferred to our facility for management of her heart failure. The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was found to have a posterior leaflet tear of the mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient also has evidence of sepsis with hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and a positive urine toxicogram suggesting urinary tract infection (UTI). There is also concern for endocarditis, but blood cultures have been negative so far. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and she has been intubated for respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema secondary to severe MR and heart failure. 

The patient's condition is unstable with ongoing hypotension and oliguria, indicating possible acute renal failure. The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with left shift raises the possibility of infection, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient's leukocytosis may also be due to bone marrow abnormalities, and further investigation is needed.

The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with hyponatremia that is initially hypovolemic but now euvolemic. There is also anemia"

   Pan CT scan:
   1. Extensive lymphadenopathy seen in the bilateral axillary regions,
   within
   the mediastinum, bihilar regions, and the retroperitoneum, and
   bilaterally
   within the inguinal regions, which is highly suggestive of a
   lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma. The spleen and liver are
   not
   enlarged.
   2. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
   3. Multiple bilateral tiny pulmonary nodules. In the setting of a
   diffuse
   proliferative disorder this could represent malignant disease, but this
   appearance is uncommon in lymphoma.
   These nodules should be followed up with a repeat CT Thorax in three
   months.
   4. Gallstone within the gallbladder, without overt evidence of acute
   cholecystitis. If however there is concern for the presence of acute
   cholecytitis based on clinical factors, a repeat ultrasound could be
   considered, given suboptimal visualization of the gallbladder noted on
   the
   prior study.
   5. Left-sided inguinal hernia which contains fluid and fat only.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   #. Presumed Lymphoma:  CT scan consistent with lymphoma, but we need
   tissue diagnosis.
   - discuss with family re goals of care and whether they want to pursue
   tissue dx and chemo
   - surgery consult for axillary or inguinal lymph node bx
   - heme-onc recs
   .
   #. Shock: etiology multifactorial from newly discovered lymphoma,
   presumed sepsis and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR).  Low SVR,
   high CO, high mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic
   physiology.  Currently requiring multiple pressors.  IABP pulled
   yesterday.  Swan was pulled out yesterday as well.
   - cont phenylephrine, levophed to keep MAP > 60; consider adding
   vasopressin if necessary
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily blood cx
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV and PO vanc/ meropenem
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: oliguric, cr 1.2 on admission, stabilized to
   1.8 today.  Likely pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.
   Family is ok with HD in emergent situation. Patient with volume
   overload, metabolic acidosis improving, no significant electrolyte
   abnormalities
   - Trend creatinine
   - will give bicarb if acidotic
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10166**]
   infection  is likely contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (OSH cardiologist) re chronicity of MR and whether
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10146**] rupture is acute
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 48.8 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia, abdomen and C diff)
   Also concerning for endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF
   normal.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Diff showed immature
   myelocytes, so also question bone marrow abnormalities. .
   Flu ruled out at OSH.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - heme consult for further evaluation possible malignancy
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - pan-scan
   - rule out flu
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion overnight, but then went
   back to afib yesterday.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is one
   possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is not
   significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - discontinue IABP support
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   - pan scan
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - will give blood today for volume repletion given that pt is possibly
   intravascularly dry
   - give NS if pt needs IVF
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD s/p 2 UpRBC.
   Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate
   normal.  When IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure. She presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath, and was admitted to Hospital 3 before being transferred to Hospital 11 for heart failure management. Upon admission, she was found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She continues to be hypotensive despite rate control and has increasing leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock. The patient also has presumed lymphoma, as evidenced by a CT scan showing extensive lymphadenopathy and multiple bilateral tiny pulmonary nodules. There is a possibility of malignant disease, but this appearance is uncommon in lymphoma. The patient has acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and mitral regurgitation (MR) with a tear at the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock due to presumed sepsis and cardiogenic shock.
2. Lymphoma-related complications, such as infection or endocarditis.
3. Acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal with underlying acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Respiratory failure, possibly due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
5. Mitral valve tear and worsening MR.
6. Leukocytosis of unknown etiology, potentially from infection or bone marrow abnormalities.

   1. Extensive lymphadenopathy seen in the bilateral axillary regions,
   within
   the mediastinum, bihilar regions, and the retroperitoneum, and

   within the inguinal regions, which is highly suggestive of a
   lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma. The spleen and liver are

   2. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
   3. Multiple bilateral tiny pulmonary nodules. In the setting of a

   appearance is uncommon in lymphoma.
   These nodules should be followed up with a repeat CT Thorax in three

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to be
   hypotensive despite rate control now with increasing leukocytosis,
   concerning for septic shock.
   .
   #. Presumed Lymphoma:  CT scan consistent with lymphoma, but we need
   tissue diagnosis.
   - discuss with family re goals of care and whether they want to pursue
   tissue dx and chemo
   - surgery consult for axillary or inguinal lymph node bx
   - heme-onc recs
   .
   #. Shock: etiology multifactorial from newly discovered lymphoma,
   presumed sepsis and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR).  Low SVR,
   high CO, high mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic
   physiology.  Currently requiring multiple pressors.  IABP pulled
   yesterday.  Swan was pulled out yesterday as well.
   - cont phenylephrine, levophed to keep MAP > 60; consider adding
   vasopressin if necessary
   - wean IABP and pull today
   - d/c swanz-catheter and replace with triple lumen
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily blood cx
   - CT torso today if pt stabilizes
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV and PO vanc/ meropenem
   - consider r/o PE if condition does not improve
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: oliguric, cr 1.2 on admission, rising to 1.9.
   Likely pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following, patient will
   likely need CVVHD but family has decided to limit care.  Patient with
   volume overload, metabolic acidosis but no significant electrolyte
   abnormalities
   - discontinue IABP
   - pan scan
   - Trend creatinine
   - cont bicarb gtt
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10166**]
   infection  is likely contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - be gentle on IVF to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   - discontinue IABP support
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (OSH cardiologist) re chronicity of MR and whether
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10146**] rupture is acute
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 48.8 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia, abdomen and C diff)
   Also concerning for endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF
   normal.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Diff showed immature
   myelocytes, so also question bone marrow abnormalities. .
   Flu ruled out at OSH.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - heme consult for further evaluation possible malignancy
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   - pan-scan
   - rule out flu
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion overnight, but then went
   back to afib yesterday.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is one
   possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is not
   significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - continue Amiodarone gtt
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   - discontinue IABP support
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   - pan scan
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - will give blood today for volume repletion given that pt is possibly
   intravascularly dry
   - give NS if pt needs IVF
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD s/p 2 UpRBC.
   Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate
   normal.  When IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure. She presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath, which led to her admission to Hospital3 and subsequent transfer to Hospital11. Upon admission, she was hypotensive and required rate control for newly discovered atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She also exhibited increasing leukocytosis, suggesting a possible septic shock. Subsequent investigations revealed extensive lymphadenopathy suggestive of lymphoma, acute renal failure, respiratory failure possibly due to pulmonary edema and pneumonia, mitral regurgitation caused by a tear in the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, leukocytosis with immature myelocytes indicating possible bone marrow abnormalities, and hyponatremia potentially related to heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's increasing leukocytosis and hypotension suggest a possible septic shock. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

2. Lymphoma: The CT scan shows extensive lymphadenopathy, which is highly suggestive of lymphoma. Tissue diagnosis is necessary to confirm the presence of lymphoma and guide further management.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Limiting care as per family decision, but CVVHD may be required in the future.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s).
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Have consulted heme re lymphoma dx.
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and recent admission for management of her heart failure. She has been transferred to another hospital due to the worsening of her condition. The patient presents with generalized weakness, shortness of breath, and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently hypotensive and has leukocytosis, which is concerning for septic shock. The patient also has presumed lymphoma, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and mitral regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and mixed venous saturation suggest a predominantly septic physiology. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and lactate levels is crucial. Empiric antibiotic coverage should be continued, and source control measures should be implemented.

2. Lymphoma-related complications: The patient has presumed lymphoma, which may require tissue diagnosis and chemotherapy. Monitoring for any symptoms or signs of lymphoma progression is essential.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen from 1.2 to 1.8, indicating worsening renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and consideration for emergent dialysis if necessary are recommended.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with possible pulmonary edema secondary to severe mitral regurgitation and potential pneumonia. Continued mechanical ventilation"

   1. Extensive lymphadenopathy seen in the bilateral axillary regions,
   within
   the mediastinum, bihilar regions, and the retroperitoneum, and
   bilaterally
   within the inguinal regions, which is highly suggestive of a
   lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma. The spleen and liver are
   not
   enlarged.
   2. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
   3. Multiple bilateral tiny pulmonary nodules. In the setting of a
   diffuse
   proliferative disorder this could represent malignant disease, but this
   appearance is uncommon in lymphoma.
   These nodules should be followed up with a repeat CT Thorax in three
   months.
   4. Gallstone within the gallbladder, without overt evidence of acute
   cholecystitis. If however there is concern for the presence of acute
   cholecytitis based on clinical factors, a repeat ultrasound could be
   considered, given suboptimal visualization of the gallbladder noted on

   prior study.
   5. Left-sided inguinal hernia which contains fluid and fat only.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure. She has been admitted with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with presumed lymphoma, septic shock, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's leukocytosis is concerning for infection, and there are signs of possible endocarditis. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may be due to infection or worsened MR. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and she has anemia. Other conditions include hyponatremia, glaucoma, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, septic shock, acute kidney injury, respiratory distress, further deterioration of the patient's lymphoma, and potential complications related to the patient's anemia and electrolyte imbalances. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, renal function, and response to treatment. Additionally, further evaluation of the lymphoma and its impact on the patient's overall health is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to require
   pressors with an increasing leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC 45.2 this AM. CT scan
   demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules. Etiology may
   be infection (e.g. pneumonia, endocarditis) but negative urine, sputum,
   blood cultures, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. ID felt
   presentation was unlikely to be infectious, but as could not exclude,
   recommended CMV/EBV/HIV, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies. All
   serologies sent except for an HIV test as patient is unable to consent.
   ID also indicated Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so
   Doxycycline started on [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness.
   Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff demonstrating
   immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue at this time
   as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. A peripheral smear as read by
   Heme/Onc was without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was
   likely to represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  On
   Meropenem, day 4, IV Vancomycin, day 6, Doxycycline, day 2.

   .
   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly
   septic physiology.  Currently requiring two pressors, but weaning
   slowly.
   - cont phenylephrine, levophed to keep MAP > 60
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily surveillance blood cx
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV
   Vanc/Meropenem/Doxycycline
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: Cr 1.2 on admission, 1.6 today.  Likely
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.  Family is ok with HD
   in emergent situation. Patient with volume overload, metabolic acidosis
   improving, no significant electrolyte abnormalities & UOP ranging
   30-40cc/hr.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Goal UOP >30cc/hr
   - f/u renal recs

   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.
   Sputum culture positive for yeast.
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - Repeat sputum culture for gram stain & AFB
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but repeat TTE
   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which may be causing overestimation of EF.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt currently in sinus rhythm, but flips into AF frequently.
   Infection is possible cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA
   is not significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin gtt for now.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   w/o abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.  CT
   showed no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Pt was intravascularly dry on admission, so initially
   hyponatremia was thought to be [**1-10**] hypovolemia, now patient euvolemic
   but hyponatremia persists.
   - Continue to trend
   - NS if UOP is low
   .
   #. Anemia: Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Fe studies c/w ACD
   s/p 2u pRBC
s.  Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12
   and folate normal.  When IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.

   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - Continue home levothyroxine dose.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and subsequently transferred to this hospital for management of her heart failure. She is now experiencing new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), requires pressors, and has leukocytosis. The patient also has diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules on CT scan, but negative cultures. The etiology of her symptoms may be infection or neoplasm. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and doxycycline for possible rickettsial illness. Her condition is complicated by shock, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and possible coronary artery disease. She has a history of glaucoma, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and anemia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and her code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's high mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic physiology. She requires two pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.2 on admission to 1.6 today, likely pre-renal with underlying acute tubular necrosis (ATN)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to Hospital 3 and then transferred to Hospital 1 for management of her heart failure. Upon admission, she was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), increasing leukocytosis, and diffuse lymphadenopathy. She also has acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock, pneumonia, possible endocarditis, and bone marrow abnormalities. She is currently on multiple pressors, intubated, and receiving tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is requiring multiple pressors, indicating a state of shock. The etiology of shock appears to be multifactorial, including newly discovered lymphoma, presumed sepsis, and cardiogenic (acute MR, AFib with RVR). Low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and high cardiac output (CO) suggest predominantly septic physiology.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as evidenced by an increase in serum creatinine from 1.2 on admission to 1.6 today. This is likely pre-renal with underlying acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal follow-up is recommended.

3. Respiratory Failure"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure.
- She presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath, and was admitted to another hospital before being transferred to the current ICU for heart failure management.
- The patient has been experiencing increasing leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite negative cultures.
- A CT scan revealed diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules.
- The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including doxycycline for possible rickettsial illness.
- Other possible diagnoses include infection (e.g., pneumonia, endocarditis) or a neoplasm.
- The patient's condition includes acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.
- There are concerns about pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and potential pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and mitral regurgitation.
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, and there are concerns about biliary obstruction and cholecystitis.
- Other medical conditions include glaucoma, hypertension, hypothyroidism, anemia, and hyponatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient's increasing leukocytosis and negative cultures suggest a possible infection, which could lead to septic shock.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creat"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to require
   pressors with an increasing leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures.
   .
   #.Diffuse lymphadenopathy:  CT scan demonstrated diffuse
   lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.
   - discuss with family re goals of care and whether they want to pursue
   tissue dx and chemo
   - surgery consult for axillary or inguinal lymph node bx
   - heme-onc recs
   .
   #. Shock: etiology multifactorial from newly discovered lymphoma,
   presumed sepsis and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR).  Low SVR,
   high CO, high mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic
   physiology.  Currently requiring multiple pressors.  IABP pulled
   yesterday.  Swan was pulled out yesterday as well.
   - cont phenylephrine, levophed to keep MAP > 60; consider adding
   vasopressin if necessary
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily blood cx
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV and PO vanc/ meropenem
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: oliguric, cr 1.2 on admission, 1.6 today.
   Likely pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.  Family is ok
   with HD in emergent situation. Patient with volume overload, metabolic
   acidosis improving, no significant electrolyte abnormalities
   - Trend creatinine
   - will give bicarb if acidotic
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10166**]
   infection  is likely contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (OSH cardiologist) re chronicity of MR and whether
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10146**] rupture is acute
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 48.8 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia, abdomen and C diff)
   Also concerning for endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF
   normal.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Diff showed immature
   myelocytes, so also question bone marrow abnormalities. On [**Last Name (un) 1540**], Vanc,
   Doxy. U/A from [**2129-12-9**] negative.
   Flu ruled out at OSH.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - heme consult for further evaluation possible malignancy
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion overnight, but then went
   back to afib yesterday.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is one
   possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is not
   significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - discontinue Amiodarone gtt, start PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue bival drip for now, goal PTT 50-60 (PTT Q4h)
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.  CT
   showed no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - will give blood today for volume repletion given that pt is possibly
   intravascularly dry
   - give NS if pt needs IVF
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD s/p 2 U pRBC.
   Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate
   normal.  When IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - Continue home levothyroxine dose.

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and later transferred to our facility for management of her heart failure. She now presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient requires pressors, indicating a possible septic shock state, despite no positive cultures. She also has diffuse lymphadenopathy, likely due to lymphoma, and is being discussed with the family regarding goals of care and potential chemotherapy. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and heart failure. Pneumonia is also a possibility given the opacity in the left lower lobe. She had labored breathing on 12/7, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showed worsening oxygenation, leading to intubation.

The patient's acute renal failure is oliguric, with a creatinine of 1.2 on admission and 1.6 today. This is likely pre-renal with overlying acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal follow-up is planned, and the family is okay with hemodialysis in an emergent situation. 

The patient's leukocytosis is concerning for infection, but cultures have been negative so far. There is also a question of endocarditis, but blood cultures and rheumatoid factor"

   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and now new afib with RVR. She continues to require
   pressors with an increasing leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures.
   .
   #.Diffuse lymphadenopathy:  CT scan demonstrated diffuse
   lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.
   - discuss with family re goals of care and whether they want to pursue
   tissue dx and chemo
   - surgery consult for axillary or inguinal lymph node bx
   - heme-onc recs
   .
   #. Shock: etiology multifactorial from newly discovered lymphoma,
   presumed sepsis and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR).  Low SVR,
   high CO, high mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic
   physiology.  Currently requiring multiple pressors.  IABP pulled
   yesterday.  Swan was pulled out yesterday as well.
   - cont phenylephrine, levophed to keep MAP > 60; consider adding
   vasopressin if necessary
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily blood cx
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV and PO vanc/ meropenem
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: oliguric, cr 1.2 on admission, 1.6 today.
   Likely pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.  Family is ok
   with HD in emergent situation. Patient with volume overload, metabolic
   acidosis improving, no significant electrolyte abnormalities
   - Trend creatinine
   - will give bicarb if acidotic
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient had labored breathing on [**12-7**], ABG showed worsening
   oxygenation, so was intubated on[**12-7**].
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem) for broad coverage
   - f/u sputum culture
   - may need to diurese when pressure is better
   - daily CXR
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # MR: patient was found to have [**Date Range 10146**] tear at posterior leaflet of
   mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.  [**Name14 (STitle) 10146**] tear is
   likely a consequence of chronic history of MVP.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10166**]
   infection  is likely contributing to her afib.
   - Csurge following (requesting dental records from OSH from [**Month (only) 1961**],
   carotid US)
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (OSH cardiologist) re chronicity of MR and whether
   [**Last Name (STitle) 10146**] rupture is acute
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: pt WBC climbing to 48.8 this AM.  Unclear whether this
   is from infection (sources include UTI, pneumonia, abdomen and C diff)
   Also concerning for endocarditis, but negative blood cultures and RF
   normal.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Diff showed immature
   myelocytes, so also question bone marrow abnormalities. .
   Flu ruled out at OSH.
   - check peripheral smear today (smear in [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**] lab)
   - heme consult for further evaluation possible malignancy
   - f/u c.diff
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm after unsuccessful
   electric and pharmacological cardioversion overnight, but then went
   back to afib yesterday.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is one
   possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is not
   significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - discontinue Amiodarone gtt, start PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue bival drip for now, goal PTT 50-60 (PTT Q4h)
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.  CT
   showed no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - will give blood today for volume repletion given that pt is possibly
   intravascularly dry
   - give NS if pt needs IVF
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD s/p 2 UpRBC.
   Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate
   normal.  When IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to Hospital3 and then transferred to Hospital1 due to worsening heart failure and newly discovered atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient continues to require pressors for hemodynamic support and has an increasing leukocytosis, which is concerning for septic shock despite negative cultures.

The patient's medical history includes chronic systolic CHF, hypertension, hypothyroidism, glaucoma, and a history of medication allergies, specifically to hydrochlorothiazide. Her current medications include doxycycline, famotidine, fentanyl, heparin sodium, midazolam, phenylephrine, and tube feeds.

The patient's physical examination findings include intubation, sedation, anasarca of upper and lower extremities, lip ulcerations, tachycardia with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, soft and non-distended abdomen, 3+ edema in both upper and lower extremities, and mild traumatic ecchymoses on arms.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 49.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 11.0 g/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels of 1.6 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels of 3.4 mmol/L. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes, decreased albumin, and electrolyte abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Diffuse lymphadenopathy: CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules. The patient has been discussed with family regarding goals of care and whether they want to pursue tissue diagnosis and chemotherapy.

2. Shock: Etiology is multifactorial, including newly discovered lymphoma, presumed sepsis, and cardiogenic (acute mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation with RVR). The patient requires multiple pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg and continues to trend closely.

3. Acute renal failure: Oliguric with creatinine of 1.2 on admission and 1.6 today. Likely pre-renal with overlying acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal consultation has been requested.

4. Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and heart failure. Pneumonia is also possible given opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL). The patient was intubated on [**12-7**].

5. Mitral regurgitation: The patient has a tear at the posterior leaflet"

   back to afib yesterday.  In terms of etiology of afib, infection is one
   possibility.  Other etiologies include worsened MR (although LA is not
   significantly dilated).  TSH normal.
   - discontinue Amiodarone gtt, start PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue bival drip for now, goal PTT 50-60 (PTT Q4h)
   .
   # PUMP: history of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema).  Repeat TTE
   here at [**Hospital1 **] showed normal EF, but given mod MR, this EF could be
   overestimated.  Patient appeared volume depleted on admission, but now
   euvolemic.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT:  Question whether she has biliary
   obstruction, leading to cholecystitis or cholangitis, given her
   significantly elevated WBC. However, blood cx negative so far, and pt
   has no abdominal pain. RUQ US showed no significant abnormalities.  CT
   showed no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue on aspirin for now.
   .
   # UTI: Citrobacter only resistent to macrobid, potential source
   - treatment as above
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: pt was initially intravascularly dry, so initially
   hyponatremia was mostly [**1-10**] hypovolemic.  currently euvolemic but pt
   continues to have hyponatremia, question whether this is from heart
   failure
   - continue to trend
   - will give blood today for volume repletion given that pt is possibly
   intravascularly dry
   - give NS if pt needs IVF
   .
   #. Anemia: normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Most likely
   chronic diseases.  Fe studies are consistent with ACD s/p 2 UpRBC.
   Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12 and folate
   normal.  When IABP in place, there is a risk of hemolysis.
   - Trend HCT
   - check hemolysis labs today
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #History of hypertension:
   - hold home lisinopril given pressures.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - continue home levothyroxine dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, presenting with generalized weakness and shortness of breath.
- She was admitted to Hospital3 and transferred to Hospital1 for heart failure management.
- The patient now has new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and requires pressors.
- There is a concern for septic shock despite no positive cultures.
- The patient has leukocytosis, possibly due to infection or malignancy.
- She has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal with underlying acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The patient also has respiratory failure likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and heart failure.
- There is a possibility of pneumonia given opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL).
- The patient has a tear at the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR.
- The MR is likely a consequence of chronic history of mitral valve prolapse (MVP).
- The patient's infection may be contributing to her atrial fibrillation.
- Other potential complications and conditions include leukocytosis, elevated alk phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), coronary artery disease, urinary tract infection (UTI), hyponatremia, anemia, glaucoma, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

She also has acute renal failure with an improving creatinine level, respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary edema and severe mitral regurgitation, and a history of chronic systolic heart failure with normal ejection fraction. 

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in assist-control mode. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline. 

Other notable findings include anemia with a normocytic, normochromic picture and reticulocyte count indicating poor bone marrow response, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte abnormalities. 

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, and acute renal failure. 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 36.2 this
   AM.. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.
   Etiology may be infection (e.g. pneumonia, endocarditis) but negative
   urine, sputum, blood cultures, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. ID
   felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious, but as could not
   exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies.
   All serologies sent except for an HIV test as patient is unable to
   consent. ID also indicated Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so
   Doxycycline started on [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness.
   Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff demonstrating
   immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue at this time
   as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. A peripheral smear as read by
   Heme/Onc was without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was
   likely to represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  On
   Meropenem, day 5, IV Vancomycin, day 7, Doxycycline, day 3. PPD placed
   on [**2129-12-11**]

   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly
   septic physiology.  Now off neo, still on levophed

   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily surveillance blood cx
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV
   Vanc/Meropenem/Doxycycline
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: Improving significantly.  Cr 1.2 on admission,
   1.3 today.  Likely pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.
   Family is ok with HD in emergent situation. Patient with volume
   overload, metabolic acidosis resolved, no significant electrolyte
   abnormalities & UOP ranging 30-40cc/hr.
   - Trend creatinine

   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.
   Sputum culture negative for infections.
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u sputum cx, [**Date Range 7910**], PCP and fungal cx
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but repeat TTE
   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which may be causing overestimation of EF.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin gtt for now.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT: pt w/o abdominal pain on admission. RUQ US
   showed no significant abnormalities, no biliary obstruction.  CT showed
   no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Improving.  Pt was intravascularly dry on admission,
   so initially hyponatremia was thought to be [**1-10**] hypovolemia, now
   patient euvolemic.
   - Continue to trend
   - NS if UOP is low

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and a recent admission for generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She has been transferred to this hospital for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's condition is improving, with decreasing pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, but there is concern for septic shock. She has diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules on a CT scan, and her blood cultures are negative. The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). There is also evidence of anemia, hyponatremia, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, doxycycline, famotidine, midazolam, and heparin sodium. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in assist-control mode. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, mild traumatic ecchymoses on her arms, oral ulcerations, and significant peripheral edema.

The patient's assessment includes leukocytosis and diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. The etiology may be infection (e.g., pneumonia, endocarditis) but negative cultures. ID felt the presentation was unlikely to be infectious, but could not exclude it. They recommended CMV/EBV/HIV serologies, anaplasma serology, tularemia serology, ehrlichia serology, babesia serologies, and PCR, b-glucan, galactomannan pending. Imaging studies include a CXR scheduled, pending. The patient has also been placed on doxycycline for possible rickettsial illness.

The plan includes continuing current antibiotic coverage with IV vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline, daily surveillance blood cultures, and daily CXR. The patient's condition should be followed closely, with attention to trends in CBC, renal function, respiratory status, and electrolyte balance."

   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 36.2 this
   AM.. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.
   Etiology may be infection (e.g. pneumonia, endocarditis) but negative
   urine, sputum, blood cultures, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. ID
   felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious, but as could not
   exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies.
   All serologies sent except for an HIV test as patient is unable to
   consent. ID also indicated Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so
   Doxycycline started on [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness.
   Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff demonstrating
   immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue at this time
   as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. A peripheral smear as read by
   Heme/Onc was without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was
   likely to represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  On
   Meropenem, day 5, IV Vancomycin, day 7, Doxycycline, day 3. PPD placed

   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly
   septic physiology.  Now off neo, still on levophed
   - cont levophed to keep MAP > 60, slowly wean down
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat (goal >
   70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily surveillance blood cx
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV
   Vanc/Meropenem/Doxycycline
   .
   #. Acute Renal failure: Improving significantly.  Cr 1.2 on admission,
   1.3 today.  Likely pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.
   Family is ok with HD in emergent situation. Patient with volume
   overload, metabolic acidosis resolved, no significant electrolyte
   abnormalities & UOP ranging 30-40cc/hr.
   - Trend creatinine

   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Patient intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.
   Sputum culture negative for infections.
   - continue current AC mode
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u sputum cx, [**Date Range 7910**], PCP and fungal cx
   - need to rule out PE when pt can get IV contrast
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but repeat TTE
   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which may be causing overestimation of EF.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin gtt for now.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT: pt w/o abdominal pain on admission. RUQ US
   showed no significant abnormalities, no biliary obstruction.  CT showed
   no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Improving.  Pt was intravascularly dry on admission,
   so initially hyponatremia was thought to be [**1-10**] hypovolemia, now
   patient euvolemic.
   - Continue to trend
   - NS if UOP is low

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure who was admitted for management of heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been improving but still requires pressor support. The patient's leukocytosis is concerning for septic shock, despite negative cultures, and a CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. The etiology may be infection (e.g., pneumonia, endocarditis) or a possible neoplasm.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline for broad-spectrum coverage. She is also on levophed for blood pressure support and has a PPD placed. Her renal function is improving, and she is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Sputum culture results are negative for infection.

Other medical conditions and complications include acute renal failure, which is improving, and anemia. The patient's sodium levels are also being monitored and managed appropriately.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output improving
   (100/hr on rounds) from 27 o/n. The fluid is from hypoalbuminemia, CHF,
   and leaky capillaries, either from septic physiology for idiopathically
   ([**Last Name (un) 10210**] syndrome)
   -          Goal diuresis is 1-1.5 litres is 24 hours
   -          start lasix drip at 5/hr
   -          goal CVP is 10, at 15 at present. Balance pressors and
   diuretics with CVP goals

   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.  Family is ok with HD
   in emergent situation. Patient with volume overload, metabolic acidosis
   resolved, no significant electrolyte abnormalities & UOP ranging
   30-40cc/hr, just under 30 for [**12-12**]. Renal reccomends pressors over IVF

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to a hospital and then transferred to another due to her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she has been improving with less pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, but still requires assistance for her respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload: The patient has anasarca (generalized edema) and fluid imbalance. Her urine output has improved, but she still has a significant fluid overload. The goal is to achieve diuresis of 1-1.5 liters in 24 hours using Lasix (furosemide) drip. If this does not work, ultrafiltration may be considered. The target CVP is 10, and the MAP goal is 65.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 1.2 on admission to 1.1 today. It is likely pre-renal with overlying acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The renal team recommends continuing pressors for pressure management and monitoring creatinine trends. The goal is to maintain urine output greater than 30 cc/hr.

3. Neurologic status: The patient's neurologic status is evolving and may be related to poor clearance of sedatives. If"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, fever of unknown origin, alteration in elimination related to constipation, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, heart failure, and pneumonia. The patient's arterial line was stopped at 01:00 PM on 12/12/2129 and restarted at 01:30 PM on the same day. The cordis/introducer was stopped at 04:00 PM on 12/12/2129 and a multi-lumen line was started at the same time. The patient is still on levophed and is trying to wean it down. The patient's right internal jugular (RIJ) cordis was removed and the left internal jugular (LIJ) was placed. A culture was sent from the RIJ tip and purulent material around the line was observed. The family was informed and surgery was re-consulted for lymph node biopsy. The patient has been NPO since midnight in case she is getting a node biopsy. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 12/12/2129 at 08:16 AM, doxycycline on 12/13/2129 at 04:00 AM, and meropenem on 12/13/2129 at 04:40 AM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium at 1,050 units/hour and norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min. Other medications and ICU care information are provided in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and the current ventilator settings include a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Monitoring for changes in oxygenation and clinical signs of infection is important.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be caused by factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or medications. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial. Daily assessment of urine output, electrolyte levels, and creatinine clearance is necessary.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has been experiencing fever despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection. Cultures from blood, urine, and other relevant sites should be analyzed. A thorough physical examination and review of all systems are important to determine the cause of fever.

4. Alteration in Elimination: The patient has constipation, which can lead to alteration in elimination. Stool softeners and increased fluid intake should"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure. She was admitted to the hospital due to generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was later transferred to this ICU for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's condition has been improving, with less reliance on pressors and decreasing leukocytosis. However, there are concerns about septic shock, as indicated by a CT scan showing diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules. Despite negative cultures and a lack of positive findings for infectious serologies, the patient remains on empiric antibiotic coverage with IV Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Doxycycline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is presumed to have had infection-related shock initially, but now there is a possibility of cardiogenic shock due to acute mitral regurgitation and heart failure. The high mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic physiology. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and if the patient's MAP is very high, it may be time to wean off the vasopressor or use a pressure window for diuresis/ultrafiltration.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 1.2 on admission to 1.1 today. This is likely pre-renal with underlying acute tub"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with generalized weakness, shortness of breath, and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been admitted to the hospital multiple times and is currently in the ICU for management of her heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient is improving with less pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, but remains in respiratory failure. She has diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules on CT scan, and her peripheral smear shows immature myelocytes, raising suspicion for a possible neoplasm or infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid Overload: The patient exhibits signs of fluid overload, including anasarca (generalized swelling), hypoalbuminemia, and edematous abdomen. The goal is to achieve diuresis of 1-1.5 liters in 24 hours using Lasix, and if unsuccessful, ultrafiltration may be considered.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has pre-renal acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.1. Renal function is improving, and the goal is to maintain urine output greater than 30 cc/hr. Pressors may be required for pressure management.
3. Neurologic Status: The patient's neurologic status is evolving and may be related to poor clearance of sedatives. If no resolution, a CT head or lumbar puncture"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output improving
   (100/hr on rounds) from 27 o/n. The fluid is from hypoalbuminemia, CHF,
   and leaky capillaries, either from septic physiology for idiopathically
   ([**Last Name (un) 10210**] syndrome). On [**11-22**] she met her goal diuresis with UOP
   150-200 and is now at 10 mg/hr lasix drip.
   PLAN FOR [**12-14**]
   -          Goal diuresis is 1-1.5 litres is q24 hours
   -          continue lasix drip at 10/hr, up or downtitrating with an
   eye on pressures, electrolytes and renal function (all stable)
   -          goal CVP is 10, at 13 at present. Balance pressors and
   diuretics with CVP goals
   -          MAP goal is 65, ranging 60-71 is acceptable with dynamic
   pressor manipulation
   -          can ultrafiltrate if lasix doesn
t work
   -          if leaky capillary syndrome, then lasix/ultrafiltration or
   terbutaline/Aminophylline
   .
   # Neurologic status: evolving. Wiggled toes on [**12-13**]. Still likely
   related to poor clearance of sedatives. If no resolution, then
   considering CT head or LP.
   -          follow
   -          OT consult for mobility
   .
   #.FUO, Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 29
   (2% bands) this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy &
   pulmonary nodules. Etiology may be infection (e.g. pneumonia,
   endocarditis) but negative urine, sputum, blood cultures, flu negative
   at OSH, and RF normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but as could not exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV,
   anaplasma, rickettsial serologies. All serologies sent except for an
   HIV test as patient is unable to consent. Acute CMV, EBV, Toxo
   negative. Respiratory viral panel is negative. UCx negative. Cdiff neg.
   ID also indicated Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so
   Doxycycline started on [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness. PPD
   placed on [**2129-12-11**] is negative as of [**2129-12-13**] (though anasarca makes
   interpretation difficult.).  Could also be possible neoplasm given CT
   scan & diff demonstrating immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm
   with tissue at this time as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. On [**12-13**],
   they will reassess LN Bx. A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was
   without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to
   represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Had 8 days of
   Vanc d/c on [**12-13**]. On Meropenem, day 7 (switched to TID), Doxycycline,
   day 7 (switched to oral on [**12-13**]). Central venous access resited to LIJ
   from RIJ on [**12-12**].
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and doxy; want to d/c abx. Want to sent 10 days of
   empiric therapy as goal.
   - f/u any daily Heme/Onc recs
   - f/u any daily ID recs

   in emergent situation. Patient with volume overload, metabolic acidosis
   resolved, no significant electrolyte abnormalities & UOP ranging
   150-200/hr up from 30-40cc/hr and just under 30 on [**12-12**]. Renal

   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Urine ouput greatly improved. Cr down to 1.  She is now mobilizing
   volume overlaod. She now responds to questions at times. CXR improved.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and then transferred to this facility for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has been improving, with less pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, which is concerning for septic shock despite no positive cultures and a computed tomography (CT) scan showing diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.

The patient's current condition includes fluid overload, anasarca, leukocytosis, fever of unknown origin (FUO), diffuse lymphadenopathy, and renal failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple medications including vasopressors, diuretics, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, fever, and diffuse lymphadenopathy, which raises concerns for an underlying infection. The negative cultures may indicate antibiotic coverage, but further investigation is needed to rule out any infectious etiology.

2. Pulmonary issues: The patient has respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and heart failure. Pneumonia is also a possibility given the opacity in the left lower lobe ("

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output improving
   (100/hr on rounds) from 27 o/n. The fluid is from hypoalbuminemia, CHF,
   and leaky capillaries, either from septic physiology for idiopathically
   ([**Last Name (un) 10210**] syndrome). On [**11-22**] she met her goal diuresis with UOP
   150-200 and is now at 10 mg/hr lasix drip.
   PLAN FOR [**12-14**]
   -          Goal diuresis is 1-1.5 litres is q24 hours
   -          continue lasix drip at 10/hr, up or downtitrating with an
   eye on pressures, electrolytes and renal function (all stable)
   -          goal CVP is 10, at 13 at present. Balance pressors and
   diuretics with CVP goals
   -          MAP goal is 65, ranging 60-71 is acceptable with dynamic
   pressor manipulation
   -          can ultrafiltrate if lasix doesn
t work
   -          if leaky capillary syndrome, then lasix/ultrafiltration or
   terbutaline/Aminophylline
   .
   # Neurologic status: evolving. Wiggled toes on [**12-13**]. Still likely
   related to poor clearance of sedatives. If no resolution, then
   considering CT head or LP.
   -          follow
   -          OT consult for mobility
   .
   #.FUO, Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 29
   (2% bands) this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy &
   pulmonary nodules. Etiology may be infection (e.g. pneumonia,
   endocarditis) but negative urine, sputum, blood cultures, flu negative
   at OSH, and RF normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but as could not exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV,
   anaplasma, rickettsial serologies. All serologies sent except for an
   HIV test as patient is unable to consent. Acute CMV, EBV, Toxo
   negative. Respiratory viral panel is negative. UCx negative. Cdiff neg.
   ID also indicated Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so
   Doxycycline started on [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness. PPD
   placed on [**2129-12-11**] is negative as of [**2129-12-13**] (though anasarca makes
   interpretation difficult.).  Could also be possible neoplasm given CT
   scan & diff demonstrating immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm
   with tissue at this time as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. On [**12-13**],
   they will reassess LN Bx. A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was
   without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to
   represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Had 8 days of
   Vanc d/c on [**12-13**]. On Meropenem, day 7 (switched to TID), Doxycycline,
   day 7 (switched to oral on [**12-13**]). Central venous access resited to LIJ
   from RIJ on [**12-12**].
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and doxy; want to d/c abx. Want to sent 10 days of
   empiric therapy as goal.
   - f/u any daily Heme/Onc recs
   - f/u any daily ID recs
   - f/u any daily G Surgery recs; they will biopsy if ""recovers from
   acute event""
   - f/u cx
s, all cultures negative to date
   - f/u infectious serologies
   - continue to trend CBC
   - f/u cx from purulent material at RIJ
   .
   # Resolving acute Renal failure:
    Improving significantly.  Cr 1.2 on admission, 1.0 today.  Likely
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.  Family is ok with HD
   in emergent situation. Patient with volume overload, metabolic acidosis
   resolved, no significant electrolyte abnormalities & UOP ranging
   150-200/hr up from 30-40cc/hr and just under 30 on [**12-12**]. Renal
   reccomends pressors over IVF for pressure management. Patient is on a
   lasix drip
   -  diurese or ultrafiltrate given overload, as above
    - Trend creatinine
   -  Goal UOP >30cc/hr, patient well above
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly
   septic physiology.  Now off neo, still on Levophed. On [**12-12**] Renal team
   argues a role for leaky capillary syndrome, reccomends pressors over
   IVF for pressure management.  MAP on [**12-14**] is 60-71. Tolerating diuresis
   as of [**12-14**]
   - continue pressors with constant aim to minimize
   - cont lasix
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, cautious fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat
   (goal > 70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily surveillance blood cx
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV Meropenem/Doxycycline.
   Consider d/c on Day 10
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Possibly leaky capillary syndrome. Patient intubated on[**12-7**]
   in context of respiratory distress. Sputum culture negative for
   infections. PE remote possibility. Today is Vent day 8, on CMV
   - cont diuresis
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   -  f/u sputum cx, AFB, PCP and fungal cx
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but repeat TTE
   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which may be causing overestimation of EF.
   - diuresis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin gtt for now.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT: pt w/o abdominal pain on admission. RUQ US
   showed no significant abnormalities, no biliary obstruction.  CT showed
   no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities. Elevated Alk Phos (mild)
   with GGT implies infiltrative vs toxic insult to biliary tree (drugs,
   infection, gastrointestinal endotoxins) vs arterial hepatopathy
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Improving.  Pt was intravascularly dry on admission,
   so initially hyponatremia was thought to be [**1-10**] hypovolemia, now
   patient hypervolemic
   - Continue to trend, respond to acute changes
   .
   #. Anemia: Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Fe studies c/w ACD
   s/p 2u pRBC
s.  Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12
   and folate normal.
   - Trend HCT
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - Continue home levothyroxine dose.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the hospital due to generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was transferred to this hospital for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient is improving with less pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, but there are concerns for septic shock despite no positive cultures. A CT scan showed diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. The patient has anasarca (generalized swelling), hypoalbuminemia, and fluid overload.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and she is intubated on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals thick secretions with a bloody tinge, an irregular and tachycardic heartbeat with a systolic murmur, rhonchi on lung auscultation bilaterally, edematous abdomen, anasarca with fluid weeping from puncture sites, and bounding pulses. Neurologic examination shows evolving status, with the patient wiggling toes on one occasion but not responding consistently to commands.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output improving
   (100/hr on rounds) from 27 o/n. The fluid is from hypoalbuminemia, CHF,
   and leaky capillaries, either from septic physiology for idiopathically
   ([**Last Name (un) 10210**] syndrome). On [**11-22**] she met her goal diuresis with UOP
   150-200 and is now at 10 mg/hr lasix drip.
   PLAN FOR [**12-14**]
   -          Goal diuresis is 1-1.5 litres is q24 hours
   -          continue lasix drip at 10/hr, up or downtitrating with an
   eye on pressures, electrolytes and renal function (all stable)
   -          goal CVP is 10, at 13 at present. Balance pressors and
   diuretics with CVP goals
   -          MAP goal is 65, ranging 60-71 is acceptable with dynamic
   pressor manipulation
   -          can ultrafiltrate if lasix doesn
t work
   -          if leaky capillary syndrome, then lasix/ultrafiltration or
   terbutaline/Aminophylline
   .
   # Neurologic status: evolving. Wiggled toes on [**12-13**]. Still likely
   related to poor clearance of sedatives. If no resolution, then
   considering CT head or LP.
   -          follow
   -          OT consult for mobility
   .
   #. Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 29 (2%
   bands) this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy &
   pulmonary nodules. Etiology may be infection (e.g. pneumonia,
   endocarditis) but negative urine, sputum, blood cultures, flu negative
   at OSH, and RF normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but as could not exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV,
   anaplasma, rickettsial serologies. All serologies sent except for an
   HIV test as patient is unable to consent. Acute CMV, EBV, Toxo
   negative. Respiratory viral panel is negative. UCx negative. Cdiff neg.
   ID also indicated Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so
   Doxycycline started on [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness. PPD
   placed on [**2129-12-11**] is negative as of [**2129-12-13**] (though anasarca makes
   interpretation difficult.).  Could also be possible neoplasm given CT
   scan & diff demonstrating immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm
   with tissue at this time as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. On [**12-13**],
   they will reassess LN Bx. A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was
   without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to
   represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Had 8 days of
   Vanc d/c on [**12-13**]. On Meropenem, day 7 (switched to TID), Doxycycline,
   day 7 (switched to oral on [**12-13**]). Central venous access resited to LIJ
   from RIJ on [**12-12**].
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and doxy; want to d/c abx. Want to sent 10 days of
   empiric therapy as goal.
   - f/u any daily Heme/Onc recs
   - f/u any daily ID recs
   - f/u any daily G Surgery recs; they will biopsy if ""recovers from
   acute event""
   - f/u cx
s, all cultures negative to date
   - f/u infectious serologies
   - continue to trend CBC
   - f/u cx from purulent material at RIJ
   .
   # Resolving acute Renal failure:
    Improving significantly.  Cr 1.2 on admission, 1.0 today.  Likely
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.  Family is ok with HD
   in emergent situation. Patient with volume overload, metabolic acidosis
   resolved, no significant electrolyte abnormalities & UOP ranging
   150-200/hr up from 30-40cc/hr and just under 30 on [**12-12**]. Renal
   reccomends pressors over IVF for pressure management. Patient is on a
   lasix drip
   -  diurese or ultrafiltrate given overload, as above
    - Trend creatinine
   -  Goal UOP >30cc/hr, patient well above
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly
   septic physiology.  Now off neo, still on Levophed. On [**12-12**] Renal team
   argues a role for leaky capillary syndrome, reccomends pressors over
   IVF for pressure management.  MAP on [**12-14**] is 60-71. Tolerating diuresis
   as of [**12-14**]
   - continue pressors with constant aim to minimize
   - cont lasix
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, cautious fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat
   (goal > 70%), lactate and UOP
   - daily surveillance blood cx
   - continue empiric antibiotic coverage with IV Meropenem/Doxycycline.
   Consider d/c on Day 10
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of
   severe MR and heart failure.  Pneumonia is also possible given opacity
   in LLL.  Possibly leaky capillary syndrome. Patient intubated on[**12-7**]
   in context of respiratory distress. Sputum culture negative for
   infections. PE remote possibility. Today is Vent day 8, on CMV
   - cont diuresis
   - continue current abx (vanc, meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   -  f/u sputum cx, AFB, PCP and fungal cx
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but repeat TTE
   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which may be causing overestimation of EF.
   - diuresis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin gtt for now.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT: pt w/o abdominal pain on admission. RUQ US
   showed no significant abnormalities, no biliary obstruction.  CT showed
   no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities. Elevated Alk Phos (mild)
   with GGT implies infiltrative vs toxic insult to biliary tree (drugs,
   infection, gastrointestinal endotoxins) vs arterial hepatopathy
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Improving.  Pt was intravascularly dry on admission,
   so initially hyponatremia was thought to be [**1-10**] hypovolemia, now
   patient hypervolemic
   - Continue to trend, respond to acute changes
   .
   #. Anemia: Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Fe studies c/w ACD
   s/p 2u pRBC
s.  Retic 1.5, indicating poor bone marrow response.  B12
   and folate normal.
   - Trend HCT
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - continue home medications
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - TSH 3.3
   - Continue home levothyroxine dose.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Fluid overload: The patient has been diagnosed with fluid overload, which is indicated by anasarca (generalized swelling) and hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood). This can lead to respiratory distress and pulmonary edema.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, as evidenced by a high creatinine level. However, the renal function is improving, but careful monitoring is required.

3. Septic shock: The patient was initially presumed to have septic shock due to infection, but no positive cultures have been identified. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting treatment accordingly.

4. Leaky capillary syndrome: The patient may have a leaky capillary syndrome, which is characterized by fluid loss from the blood vessels into surrounding tissues. This can contribute to edema and difficulty in managing fluid balance.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Pneumonia is also a possibility. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.

6. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and recent events suggest worsening heart failure. Optimization of diuretic therapy and monitoring for signs of fluid overload are crucial.

7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient frequently"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Pneumonia is also possible but sputum cx has been negative.  Patient
   intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress. PE remote
   possibility. Patient was briefly on CPAP (setting: [**11-12**]) yesterday
   ([**12-14**]), but breathing at 31-33 breaths per minute, so was put back on AC
   mode.  Barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema, de-conditioning,
   secretions and plugging, and  anxiety.   Per RT, pt has less secretions
   but still required [**3-13**] suctions overnight last night.  RSBI 81 this
   morning.
   - continue AC mode, try CPAP again today
   - reassurance to patient to reduce anxiety, can try a small dose versed
   if very anxious
   - cont diuresis, currently on lasix gtt at 2.5mg /hr
   - continue current abx (meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage

   # FUO, Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 21.6
   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary

   endocarditis).  HSV positive, so this is possibly generalized HSV
   infection.  Other infectious etiologies have been negative, including

   normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious, but as
   could not exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV, anaplasma, rickettsial
   serologies. All serologies sent except for an HIV test as patient is
   unable to consent. Acute CMV, EBV, Toxo negative. Respiratory viral
   panel is negative. UCx negative. Cdiff neg. ID also indicated
   Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so Doxycycline started on
   [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness. PPD placed on [**2129-12-11**] is
   negative as of [**2129-12-13**] (though anasarca makes interpretation
   difficult.).  Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff
   demonstrating immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue
   at this time as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. However, they will
   reassess LN Bx. A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was without
   clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to represent
   lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Had 8 days of Vanc d/c

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and later transferred to our facility for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient has been improving with less pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive cultures and a CT scan demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory distress, likely caused by sepsis-associated vasodilation and leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and heart failure, and fluid resuscitation received earlier. The patient is on assist-control (AC) mode and will continue with daily chest X-rays. The barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema, de-conditioning, secretions and plugging, and anxiety.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO), Leukocytosis & Diffuse Lymphadenopathy: The patient's WBC count is trending down, and a CT scan showed diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules. The etiology may be infection (e.g., viral, pneumonia, endocarditis). HSV is positive, possibly generalized HSV infection. Other infectious et"

   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Pneumonia is also possible but sputum cx has been negative.  Patient
   intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress. PE remote
   possibility. Patient was briefly on CPAP (setting: [**11-12**]) yesterday
   ([**12-14**]), but breathing at 31-33 breaths per minute, so was put back on AC
   mode.  Barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema, de-conditioning,
   secretions and plugging, and  anxiety.   Per RT, pt has less secretions
   but still required [**3-13**] suctions overnight last night.  RSBI 81 this
   morning.
   - continue AC mode, try CPAP again today

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, who was admitted to the ICU for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been improving but remains critically ill. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules on CT scan, positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. She also has anemia, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's medical team is considering a possible infectious cause for her condition, including generalized HSV infection, as well as other etiologies such as neoplasm or autoimmune disorders. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and doxycycline, but no positive cultures have been identified. She is also receiving antiviral therapy for HSV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to sepsis-associated vasodilation and leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and heart failure, and fluid resuscitation.
2. Pneumonia: Although the sputum culture has been negative, pneumonia cannot be completely ruled out, and the patient may require additional antimicrobial therapy.
3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Pneumonia is also possible but sputum cx has been negative.  Patient
   intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress. PE remote
   possibility. Patient was briefly on CPAP (setting: [**11-12**]) yesterday
   ([**12-14**]), but breathing at 31-33 breaths per minute, so was put back on AC
   mode.  Barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema, de-conditioning,
   secretions and plugging, and  anxiety.   Per RT, pt has less secretions
   but still required [**3-13**] suctions overnight last night.  RSBI 81 this
   morning.
   - continue AC mode, try CPAP again today
   - reassurance to patient to reduce anxiety, can try a small dose ativan
   if very anxious
   - cont diuresis, currently on lasix gtt at 2.5mg /hr
   - continue current abx (meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 21.6
   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection (e.g. viral, pneumonia,
   endocarditis).  HSV positive, so this is possibly generalized HSV
   infection.  Other infectious etiologies have been negative, including
   negative urine, sputum, blood cultures, flu negative at OSH, and RF
   normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious, but as
   could not exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV, anaplasma, rickettsial
   serologies. All serologies sent except for an HIV test as patient is
   unable to consent. Acute CMV, EBV, Toxo negative. Respiratory viral
   panel is negative. UCx negative. Cdiff neg. ID also indicated
   Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so Doxycycline started on
   [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness. PPD placed on [**2129-12-11**] is
   negative as of [**2129-12-13**] (though anasarca makes interpretation
   difficult.).  Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff
   demonstrating immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue
   at this time as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. However, they will
   reassess LN Bx. A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was without
   clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to represent
   lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Had 8 days of Vanc d/c
   on [**12-13**]. On Meropenem, day 8 (switched to TID), Doxycycline, day 6
   (switched to oral on [**12-13**]). Central venous access resited to LIJ from
   RIJ on [**12-12**].  cx from purulent material at RIJ and RIJ tip negative.
   - start acyclovir today
   - consider d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and doxy as there is no sign of bacterial infection
   - f/u any daily ID recs
   - f/u any daily G Surgery recs; they will biopsy if ""recovers from
   acute event""
   - f/u all other pending cx
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  HSV positive, so this is possibly generalized HSV
   infection.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic
   physiology.  Now off neo, still on Levophed. On [**12-12**] Renal team argues a
   role for leaky capillary syndrome, recommends pressors over IVF for
   pressure management.  Tolerating diuresis but levophed dose has to be
   increased yesterday ([**12-14**]).
   - start acyclovir today
   - continue pressors with constant aim to minimize IVF
   - cont lasix gtt
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, cautious fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat
   (goal > 70%), lactate and UOP
   - f/u all cx
   - consider d/c empiric antibiotic coverage with IV
   Meropenem/Doxycycline.
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output improving
   (100/hr on rounds) on lasix gtt 2.5mg /hr. The fluid is from
   hypoalbuminemia, CHF, and leaky capillaries from from septic
   physiology.
   -  Goal diuresis is 1-1.5 litres is q24 hours
   -  continue lasix drip at 2.5/hr, up or downtitrating with an eye on
   pressures, electrolytes and renal function (all stable)
   -  goal CVP is 10, at 12 at present. Balance pressors and diuretics

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Pneumonia is also possible but sputum cx has been negative.  Patient
   intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress. PE remote
   possibility. Patient was briefly on CPAP (setting: [**11-12**]) yesterday
   ([**12-14**]), but breathing at 31-33 breaths per minute, so was put back on AC
   mode.  Barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema, de-conditioning,
   secretions and plugging, and  anxiety.   Per RT, pt has less secretions
   but still required [**3-13**] suctions overnight last night.  RSBI 81 this
   morning.
   - continue AC mode, try CPAP again today
   - reassurance to patient to reduce anxiety, can try a small dose versed
   if very anxious
   - cont diuresis, currently on lasix gtt at 2.5mg /hr
   - continue current abx (meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 21.6
   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection (e.g. viral, pneumonia,
   endocarditis).  HSV positive, so this is possibly generalized HSV
   infection.  Other infectious etiologies have been negative, including
   negative urine, sputum, blood cultures, flu negative at OSH, and RF
   normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious, but as
   could not exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV, anaplasma, rickettsial
   serologies. All serologies sent except for an HIV test as patient is
   unable to consent. Acute CMV, EBV, Toxo negative. Respiratory viral
   panel is negative. UCx negative. Cdiff neg. ID also indicated
   Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so Doxycycline started on
   [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness. PPD placed on [**2129-12-11**] is
   negative as of [**2129-12-13**] (though anasarca makes interpretation
   difficult.).  Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff
   demonstrating immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue
   at this time as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. However, they will
   reassess LN Bx. A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was without
   clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to represent
   lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Had 8 days of Vanc d/c
   on [**12-13**]. On Meropenem, day 8 (switched to TID), Doxycycline, day 6
   (switched to oral on [**12-13**]). Central venous access resited to LIJ from
   RIJ on [**12-12**].  cx from purulent material at RIJ and RIJ tip negative.
   - start acyclovir 400mg TID  today
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and doxy for now
   - f/u any daily ID recs
   - f/u any daily G Surgery recs; they will biopsy if ""recovers from
   acute event""
   - f/u all other pending cx
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  HSV positive, so this is possibly generalized HSV
   infection.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic
   physiology.  Now off neo, still on Levophed. On [**12-12**] Renal team argues a
   role for leaky capillary syndrome, recommends pressors over IVF for
   pressure management.  Tolerating diuresis but levophed dose has to be
   increased yesterday ([**12-14**]).
   - start acyclovir today
   - continue pressors with constant aim to minimize IVF
   - cont lasix gtt at 2.5mg/hr
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, cautious fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat
   (goal > 70%), lactate and UOP
   - f/u all cx
   - continueIV Meropenem/Doxycycline for now
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output improving
   (100/hr on rounds) on lasix gtt 2.5mg /hr. The fluid is from
   hypoalbuminemia, CHF, and leaky capillaries from from septic
   physiology.
   -  Goal diuresis is -500cc today
   -  continue lasix drip at 2.5/hr, up or downtitrating with an eye on
   pressures, electrolytes and renal function (all stable)
   -  goal CVP is 10, at 12 at present. Balance pressors and diuretics
   with CVP goals
   -  MAP goal is 65, ranging 60-71 is acceptable with dynamic pressor
   manipulation
   -  if leaky capillary syndrome, then lasix/ultrafiltration or
   terbutaline/Aminophylline
   .
   # Neurologic status: Improving.  Following commands, wiggling toes and
   opening eyes to command on [**12-15**].
   - continue to follow
   - OT consult for mobility

   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which causes overestimation of EF.
   - diuresis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin gtt for now.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT: pt w/o abdominal pain on admission. RUQ US
   showed no significant abnormalities, no biliary obstruction.  CT showed
   no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities. Elevated Alk Phos (mild)
   with GGT implies infiltrative vs toxic insult to biliary tree (drugs,
   infection, gastrointestinal endotoxins) vs arterial hepatopathy
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Resolved.  Cr 1.2 on admission, has been stable
   at 1.0 for a few days.  The etiology for acute renal failure likely
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.  Patient is on a lasix
   drip for diuresis.
   -  continue lasix gtt as above
    - Trend creatinine  [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Goal UOP >30cc/hr, patient well above
   -  f/u any renal recs

   # Hyponatremia: Improving.  Na 135 today. Pt was intravascularly dry on

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure. She presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath and was admitted to the hospital. She was later transferred to another hospital due to her worsening heart failure and new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, leukocytosis, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and shock. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics and antivirals, but no definitive source of infection has been identified. The patient's condition is complicated by anasarca, hypotension, renal failure, neurologic impairment, and electrolyte imbalances. Her current medications include meropenem, doxycycline, acyclovir, and amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to sepsis-associated vasodilation and leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and heart failure, and fluid resuscitation she received earlier. Pneumonia is also possible but sputum culture has been negative. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support her breathing.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite negative cultures and lack of obvious sources of infection, the patient has persistent fever. This could indicate an underlying infection or another"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Patient intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.
   Pneumonia is possibility given thick secretions, so sputum cx sent on
   [**12-15**]. Preliminary results demonstrate 1+ GPC in pairs. PE remote
   possibility. Patient was on CPAP (setting: [**11-12**]) yesterday ([**12-15**]), for 4
   hours but was tiring out so put back on AC mode.  Barriers to
   extubation include pulmonary edema, de-conditioning, secretions and
   plugging, and anxiety. Versed & Fentanyl attempted for reducing
   anxiety, but short-lived effect. RSBI 110 this morning.
   - continue AC mode, try CPAP again today
   - reassurance to patient to reduce anxiety, can continue with
   anxiolytics/sedatives for symptoms
   - Continue diuresis, currently on lasix gtt at 2.5mg /hr
   - Continue current abx (meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u final sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, leukocytosis & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 18.7
   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection (e.g. viral, pneumonia,
   endocarditis).  HSV positive, but given clinical presentation, unlikely
   to be generalized HSV infection.  Other infectious etiologies have been
   negative, including negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, flu
   negative at OSH, and RF normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but as could not exclude, CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma,
   rickettsial serologies all sent & negative. PPD negative. Prelim AFB
   negative. Given patient
s functional status, HIV consent could not be
   obtained. Respiratory viral panel is negative. Central venous access
   resited to LIJ from RIJ on [**12-12**].  Cx from purulent material at RIJ and
   RIJ tip negative. Sputum sent [**12-16**], prelim demonstrating 1+ for gram
   positive cocci in pairs. ID signed off as of [**12-16**]. Could also be
   possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff demonstrating immature
   myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue at this time as General
   Surgery declined LN biopsy.  A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was
   without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to
   represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.

   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly
   septic physiology.  Remains on low dose Levophed, weaned to 0.09
   mcg/kg/min this AM. On [**12-12**] Renal team proposed a role for leaky
   capillary syndrome, recommended pressors over IVF for pressure
   management.  Tolerating diuresis well.
   - Continue pressors, wean as tolerates
   - Continue IV Meropenem/Doxycycline for now
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 2.5mg/hr
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, cautious fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat
   (goal > 70%), lactate and UOP
   - f/u all cx
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output strong
   (100/hr) on lasix gtt 2.5mg /hr. Fluid accumulation owed to
   hypoalbuminemia, chronic sCHF, and leaky capillaries from septic
   physiology.
   -  Goal diuresis is -750cc today
   -  continue lasix drip at 2.5/hr, up or downtitrating with an eye on

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who was admitted for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been improving with less pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive cultures. The patient has diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules on CT scan, and her respiratory status has been unstable. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP mode, but is tiring out. The patient's fluid balance is negative, and she is tolerating diuresis well. She has elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), and her neurologic status is improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of pneumonia given the thick secretions, so sputum cultures have been sent.
2. Shock: The patient experienced presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response) insult, leading to shock. She remains on low-dose Levophed, weaned to 0.09 mcg/kg/min.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has anasarca and hypoalbuminemia, which contribute to fluid accumulation. She is on lasix gtt at 2.5mg/hr for diuresis.
4. FUO (fever of unknown origin): The patient has leukocytosis and diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. Infectious etiologies have been negative, including negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, and serologies for viral, bacterial, and fungal infections.
5. Neurologic status: The patient's neurologic status is improving, but she is still sleepy and not fully alert. She is following commands and responding to verbal stimuli.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure, but her creatinine levels have improved from 1.2 to 0.9. She is on a low-dose lasix drip for diuresis.

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information from the physician's daily progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Patient intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.
   Pneumonia is possibility given thick secretions, so sputum cx sent on
   [**12-15**]. Preliminary results demonstrate 1+ GPC in pairs. PE remote
   possibility. Patient was on CPAP (setting: [**11-12**]) yesterday ([**12-15**]), for 4
   hours but was tiring out so put back on AC mode.  Barriers to
   extubation include pulmonary edema, de-conditioning, secretions and
   plugging, and anxiety. Versed & Fentanyl attempted for reducing
   anxiety, but short-lived effect. RSBI 110 this morning.
   - continue AC mode, try CPAP again today
   - reassurance to patient to reduce anxiety, can continue with
   anxiolytics/sedatives for symptoms
   - Continue diuresis, currently on lasix gtt at 2.5mg /hr
   - Continue current abx (meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u final sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, leukocytosis & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 18.7
   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection (e.g. viral, pneumonia,
   endocarditis).  HSV positive, but given clinical presentation, unlikely
   to be generalized HSV infection.  Other infectious etiologies have been
   negative, including negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, flu
   negative at OSH, and RF normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but as could not exclude, CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma,
   rickettsial serologies all sent & negative. PPD negative. Prelim AFB
   negative. Given patient
s functional status, HIV consent could not be
   obtained. Respiratory viral panel is negative. Central venous access
   resited to LIJ from RIJ on [**12-12**].  Cx from purulent material at RIJ and
   RIJ tip negative. Sputum sent [**12-16**], prelim demonstrating 1+ for gram
   positive cocci in pairs. ID signed off as of [**12-16**]. Could also be
   possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff demonstrating immature
   myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue at this time as General
   Surgery declined LN biopsy.  A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was
   without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to
   represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.

   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly
   septic physiology.  Remains on low dose Levophed, weaned to 0.09
   mcg/kg/min this AM. On [**12-12**] Renal team proposed a role for leaky
   capillary syndrome, recommended pressors over IVF for pressure
   management.  Tolerating diuresis well.
   - Continue pressors, wean as tolerates
   - Continue IV Meropenem/Doxycycline for now
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 2.5mg/hr
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, cautious fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat
   (goal > 70%), lactate and UOP
   - f/u all cx
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output strong
   (100/hr) on lasix gtt 2.5mg /hr. Fluid accumulation owed to
   hypoalbuminemia, chronic sCHF, and leaky capillaries from septic
   physiology.
   -  Goal diuresis is -750cc today
   -  continue lasix drip at 2.5/hr, up or downtitrating with an eye on
   pressures, electrolytes and renal function (all stable)
   -  goal CVP is 13 this AM. Balance pressors and diuretics with CVP
   goals
   -  MAP goal is 65, ranging 62-76
   .
   # Neurologic status: Improving.  Following commands, wiggling toes and
   opening eyes to command on [**12-15**]. This AM, sleepy.
   - Continue to follow
   - OT consult for mobility
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but repeat TTE
   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which causes overestimation of EF.
   - Lasix gtt at 2.5/hr

   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   when pressors are weaned & bp

   # Elevated alk phos and GGT: pt w/o abdominal pain on admission. RUQ
   U/S & CT without significant hepatobiliary abnormalities. Mildly
   elevated but stable Alk Phos with GGT (implies infiltrative vs toxic
   insult to biliary tree: drugs, infection, gastrointestinal endotoxins
   vs arterial hepatopathy)
   - Continue to trend

   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Resolved, but originally thought to be
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Cr 1.2 on admission, 0.9 today.  BUN
   mildly improved from [**12-15**].  Patient  remains on a low dose Lasix drip
   for diuresis. Renal continues to follow.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and then transferred to our facility for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to sepsis-associated vasodilation and leaky capillaries, as well as pulmonary edema caused by severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure. She was intubated on [date] and is currently on assisted ventilation.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules seen on CT scan. Initial infectious etiologies have been negative, including viral, bacterial, fungal, and atypical pathogens. Other potential causes such as neoplasm or autoimmune disorders need further evaluation.
3. Shock: The patient is presumed to have septic shock, with mixed venous saturations indicating predominantly septic physiology. She requires low-dose vasopressor support with levophed.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has anasarca and fluid accumulation due to hypoalbuminemia, chronic systolic heart failure, and leaky capillaries from septic physiology. She is being managed with di"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and is being treated with acyclovir. He is also on a 14-day course of doxycycline for presumed infection. The patient's agitation and increased respiratory rate were managed with versed, but this caused a drop in blood pressure. Fentanyl was tried, but the patient remained anxious. The patient was placed on CPAP for 4 hours before being changed back to assisted controlled ventilation (AC). Lasix gtt was started at 2.5 mg/hr to achieve an input/output ratio of -500cc.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Pneumonia is also possible but sputum cx has been negative.  Patient
   intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress. PE remote
   possibility. Patient was briefly on CPAP (setting: [**11-12**]) yesterday
   ([**12-14**]), but breathing at 31-33 breaths per minute, so was put back on AC
   mode.  Barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema, de-conditioning,
   secretions and plugging, and  anxiety.   Per RT, pt has less secretions
   but still required [**3-13**] suctions overnight last night.  RSBI 81 this
   morning.
   - continue AC mode, try CPAP again today
   - reassurance to patient to reduce anxiety, can try a small dose versed
   if very anxious
   - cont diuresis, currently on lasix gtt at 2.5mg /hr
   - continue current abx (meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, Leukocytosis & Diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 21.6
   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection (e.g. viral, pneumonia,
   endocarditis).  HSV positive, so this is possibly generalized HSV
   infection.  Other infectious etiologies have been negative, including
   negative urine, sputum, blood cultures, flu negative at OSH, and RF
   normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious, but as
   could not exclude, recommended CMV/EBV/HIV, anaplasma, rickettsial
   serologies. All serologies sent except for an HIV test as patient is
   unable to consent. Acute CMV, EBV, Toxo negative. Respiratory viral
   panel is negative. UCx negative. Cdiff neg. ID also indicated
   Doxycycline was unlikely to harm patient so Doxycycline started on
   [**2129-12-10**] for any possible rickettsial illness. PPD placed on [**2129-12-11**] is
   negative as of [**2129-12-13**] (though anasarca makes interpretation
   difficult.).  Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff
   demonstrating immature myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue
   at this time as General Surgery declined LN biopsy. However, they will
   reassess LN Bx. A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was without
   clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to represent
   lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.  Had 8 days of Vanc d/c
   on [**12-13**]. On Meropenem, day 8 (switched to TID), Doxycycline, day 6
   (switched to oral on [**12-13**]). Central venous access resited to LIJ from
   RIJ on [**12-12**].  cx from purulent material at RIJ and RIJ tip negative.
   - start acyclovir 400mg TID  today
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] and doxy for now
   - f/u any daily ID recs
   - f/u any daily G Surgery recs; they will biopsy if ""recovers from
   acute event""
   - f/u all other pending cx
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  HSV positive, so this is possibly generalized HSV
   infection.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly septic
   physiology.  Now off neo, still on Levophed. On [**12-12**] Renal team argues a
   role for leaky capillary syndrome, recommends pressors over IVF for
   pressure management.  Tolerating diuresis but levophed dose has to be
   increased yesterday ([**12-14**]).
   - start acyclovir today
   - continue pressors with constant aim to minimize IVF
   - cont lasix gtt at 2.5mg/hr
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, cautious fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat
   (goal > 70%), lactate and UOP
   - f/u all cx
   - continueIV Meropenem/Doxycycline for now
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output improving
   (100/hr on rounds) on lasix gtt 2.5mg /hr. The fluid is from
   hypoalbuminemia, CHF, and leaky capillaries from from septic
   physiology.
   -  Goal diuresis is -500cc today
   -  continue lasix drip at 2.5/hr, up or downtitrating with an eye on
   pressures, electrolytes and renal function (all stable)
   -  goal CVP is 10, at 12 at present. Balance pressors and diuretics
   with CVP goals
   -  MAP goal is 65, ranging 60-71 is acceptable with dynamic pressor
   manipulation
   -  if leaky capillary syndrome, then lasix/ultrafiltration or
   terbutaline/Aminophylline
   .
   # Neurologic status: Improving.  Following commands, wiggling toes and
   opening eyes to command on [**12-15**].
   - continue to follow
   - OT consult for mobility
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but repeat TTE
   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which causes overestimation of EF.
   - diuresis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - hold nodal agents in the setting of hypotension
   - continue heparin gtt for now.
   .
   # Elevated alk phos and GGT: pt w/o abdominal pain on admission. RUQ US
   showed no significant abnormalities, no biliary obstruction.  CT showed
   no significant hepatobiliary abnormalities. Elevated Alk Phos (mild)
   with GGT implies infiltrative vs toxic insult to biliary tree (drugs,
   infection, gastrointestinal endotoxins) vs arterial hepatopathy
   - continue to trend
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations. However, MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Resolved.  Cr 1.2 on admission, has been stable
   at 1.0 for a few days.  The etiology for acute renal failure likely
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Renal following.  Patient is on a lasix
   drip for diuresis.
   -  continue lasix gtt as above
    - Trend creatinine  [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Goal UOP >30cc/hr, patient well above
   -  f/u any renal recs
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving.  Na 135 today. Pt was intravascularly dry on
   admission, so initially hyponatremia was thought to be [**1-10**] hypovolemia,
   now patient hypervolemic.
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Continue to trend

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and a recent admission for generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She has been transferred to this hospital for management of her heart failure and new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules on CT scan and a positive HSV test. Her leukocyte count is elevated, and she has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient is also experiencing shock, fluid overload, and anemia. Her neurologic status is improving, and she is following commands. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with a normal ejection fraction and known mitral regurgitation. Her rhythm is frequently in and out of atrial fibrillation, and she has been started on amiodarone. The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels suggest an infiltrative or toxic insult to the biliary tree. Her acute renal failure has resolved, and she is currently on a lasix drip for diuresis. The patient's sodium level is improving, and her anemia is normocytic and normochromic with a normal red cell distribution width. She has a history of glaucoma and hypothyroidism, which are being managed with home medications. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Patient intubated on[**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.
   Pneumonia is possibility given thick secretions, so sputum cx sent on
   [**12-15**]. Preliminary results demonstrate 1+ GPC in pairs. PE remote
   possibility. Patient was on CPAP (setting: [**11-12**]) yesterday ([**12-15**]), for 4
   hours but was tiring out so put back on AC mode.  Unclear how much MR
   and [**Month/Day (4) 10178**] tear are contributing to overload, so will reassess with
   TTE today. Patient with RSBI 110 this morning, but RR improved to
   mid-to-high 20
s. Will reassess RSBI again this afternoon and trial
   CPAP. If patient does well & RSBI <100, can attempt extubation.
   - Repeat TTE
   - try CPAP again today, can attempt extubation is RSBI <100 & patient
   does well on CPAP
   - reassurance to patient to reduce anxiety, can continue with
   anxiolytics/sedatives for symptoms
   - Continue diuresis, currently on lasix gtt at 2.5mg /hr
   - Continue current abx (meropenem, doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u final sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, leukocytosis & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 18.7
   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection (e.g. viral, pneumonia,
   endocarditis).  HSV positive, but given clinical presentation, unlikely
   to be generalized HSV infection.  Other infectious etiologies have been
   negative, including negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, flu
   negative at OSH, and RF normal. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but as could not exclude, CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma,
   rickettsial serologies all sent & negative. PPD negative. Prelim AFB
   negative. Given patient
s functional status, HIV consent could not be
   obtained. Respiratory viral panel is negative. Central venous access
   resited to LIJ from RIJ on [**12-12**].  Cx from purulent material at RIJ and
   RIJ tip negative. Sputum sent [**12-16**], prelim demonstrating 1+ for gram
   positive cocci in pairs. ID signed off as of [**12-16**]. Could also be
   possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff demonstrating immature
   myelocytes, but not able to confirm with tissue at this time as General
   Surgery declined LN biopsy.  A peripheral smear as read by Heme/Onc was
   without clear etiology and the team did not feel this was likely to
   represent lymphoma.  ESR and CRP significantly elevated.

   #. Shock: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib
   with RVR) insult.  High mixed venous saturations suggest predominantly
   septic physiology.  Remains on low dose Levophed, weaned to 0.05
   mcg/kg/min this AM. Renal recommended pressors over IVF for pressure
   management.  Tolerating diuresis well.
   - Attempt to completely wean Levophed today
   - Continue IV Meropenem/Doxycycline for now
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 2.5mg/hr
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10, cautious fluid bolus prn), Mixed venous sat
   (goal > 70%), lactate and UOP
   - f/u all cx
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance. Urine output strong
   (100/hr) on lasix gtt 2.5mg /hr. Fluid accumulation owed to
   hypoalbuminemia, chronic sCHF, and leaky capillaries from septic
   physiology.
   -  Goal diuresis is -750cc today
   -  continue lasix drip at 2.5/hr, up or downtitrating with an eye on
   pressures, electrolytes and renal function (all stable)
   -  goal CVP is 13 this AM. Balance pressors and diuretics with CVP
   goals
   -  MAP goal is 65, ranging 62-76
   .
   # Neurologic status: Improving.  Following commands, wiggling toes and
   opening eyes to command on [**12-15**]. This AM, sleepy.
   - Continue to follow
   - OT consult for mobility
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but repeat TTE
   showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at
   posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing to worsening MR
   which causes overestimation of EF.
   - Repeat TTE today
   - Lasix gtt at 2.5/hr
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   when pressors are weaned & bp

   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Resolved, but originally thought to be
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Cr 1.2 on admission, 0.9 today.  BUN
   mildly improved from [**12-15**].  Patient  remains on a low dose Lasix drip
   for diuresis. Renal continues to follow.
   -  Continue lasix gtt at 2.5/hr

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and then transferred here for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated due to respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with HSV infection and is receiving antiviral treatment. The patient's condition has improved, with less pressor requirement and improving leukocytosis, but there are concerns about septic shock, pneumonia, and potential neoplasm. She is also experiencing anasarca, hypoalbuminemia, and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. There is a possibility of pneumonia given thick secretions, so sputum culture has been sent. Preliminary results show 1+ GPC in pairs.
2. Shock: The patient is presumed to have infection-related shock and cardiogenic shock due to acute mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is on low-dose Levophed, and the goal is to completely wean off it today.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has anasarca and hypoalbuminemia, which has resulted in fluid accumulation. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU due to generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFR) and is currently on multiple medications, including antivirals, antibiotics, and diuretics. The patient's condition has improved, but she still requires mechanical ventilation and is on pressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as she has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of pneumonia given the thick secretions in her airways, so sputum cultures have been sent. The patient's respiratory support requirements may need to be reassessed, and a trial of CPAP may be attempted if her respiratory system compliance improves.

2. Shock: The patient is presumed to have had septic shock, which has contributed to her current condition. She remains on low-dose Levophed, and efforts are being made to wean her off it. Monitoring of mixed venous saturation, lactate levels, and urine output will help guide fluid and pressor management.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient has anasarca and fluid overload, likely due to hypoalbuminemia, chronic CHF, and leaky capillaries from septic physiology. Diuretic therapy is ongoing,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and then transferred to our facility for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient has shown improvement in her condition, with reduced pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, suggesting a possible septic shock. However, no positive cultures have been found, and a CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. 

She was intubated on December 7th due to respiratory distress and was placed on CPAP for a short period yesterday but was tired and asked to be put back on higher pressure support. Her tracheostomy was performed on December 16th, and she is currently on pressure support (5/0) with a goal for extubation today. 

Her fever of unknown origin, leukocytosis, and diffuse lymphadenopathy may be due to an infection, but extensive infectious work-up has been negative so far.

   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Patient intubated on [**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.  Patient
   was on CPAP (setting: 5/0) yesterday ([**12-16**]), for 40 minutes but was
   tired and asked to be put back on higher pressure support at 12/5. She
   was switched back to AC overnight to maximize change of extubation
   today.  TTE from [**12-16**] unchanged from prior, chordae & degree of MR
   stable. Patient with RSBI 85 this morning, but RR improved to low 20

   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip
   swab, extensive infectious work-up has been negative to date including
   negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, respiratory panel,
   serologies (CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies, PPD).
   Prelim AFB negative, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. Line tip &
   line site cultures negative. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could
   not be obtained. Sputum sent [**12-16**], prelim demonstrating 1+ for gram
   positive cocci in pairs. Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan
   & diff demonstrating immature myelocytes, but smear not convincing and
   not able to confirm with tissue as General Surgery declined LN biopsy.
   Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent lymphoma.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure. She was admitted with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. The patient has been improving, with decreasing pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis. However, she still has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to sepsis-associated vasodilation, pulmonary edema, and fluid resuscitation. 
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO), leukocytosis, and diffuse lymphadenopathy: The patient has been experiencing fever, elevated white blood cell count, and lymphadenopathy. Extensive infectious work-up has been negative, but the patient is improving on antibiotics. Other potential causes such as infection or neoplasm should be considered.
3. Shock: Although the patient's shock state is nearly resolved, she may still require careful monitoring and management of her fluid balance, renal function, and blood pressure.
4. Fluid overload: The patient continues to have anasarca and fluid overload due to hypoalbuminemia, chronic systolic CHF, and leaky capillary syndrome. Diuretic therapy should be continued to manage fluid balance.
5. Mitral regurgitation (MR): The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and known MR. Repeat TTE showed unchanged results,"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Patient intubated on [**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.  Patient
   was on CPAP (setting: 5/0) yesterday ([**12-16**]), for 40 minutes but was
   tired and asked to be put back on higher pressure support at 12/5. She
   was switched back to AC overnight to maximize change of extubation
   today.  TTE from [**12-16**] unchanged from prior, chordae & degree of MR
   stable. Patient with RSBI 85 this morning, but RR improved to low 20
   - Attempt extubation
   - Reassurance to patient to reduce anxiety, can continue with
   anxiolytics/sedatives for symptoms
   - Continue current Abx (Meropenem, Doxy) for broad coverage
   - daily CXR
   - f/u final sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, leukocytosis & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down, 16.1
   this AM. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip
   swab, extensive infectious work-up has been negative to date including
   negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, respiratory panel,
   serologies (CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies, PPD).
   Prelim AFB negative, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. Line tip &
   line site cultures negative. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could
   not be obtained. Sputum sent [**12-16**], prelim demonstrating 1+ for gram
   positive cocci in pairs. Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan
   & diff demonstrating immature myelocytes, but smear not convincing and
   not able to confirm with tissue as General Surgery declined LN biopsy.
   Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent lymphoma.
   - Meropenem 500mg TID, day [**9-21**]
   - Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day [**7-22**]

   - f/u any daily G Surgery recs; they will biopsy if ""recovers from
   acute event""
   - f/u all other pending cx
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   #. Shock: Nearly resolved, but thought to be [**1-10**] presumed infection and
   cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR) insult.  Pressors weaned
   completely on [**12-16**]. Renal recommended pressors over IVF for pressure
   management.  Self-diuresing well.
   - Continue IV Meropenem/Doxycycline for now
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10), Mixed venous sat (goal > 70%), and UOP
   - f/u all outstanding cx
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
) continues to
   improve. Lasix gtt held in context of mild contraction alkalosis. Urine
   output strong (100/hr) off Lasix gtt. Net negative >1800cc over past 24
   hours. CVP to single digits on [**12-16**] PM after pressors completely weaned,
   but UOP & SBP
s steady. MAP
s labile ranging 45-67 yesterday.
   -  Goal diuresis is -0.5-1.0L today
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   -  Closely monitor CVP & MAP
s, if UOP drops off, consider restarting
   low dose Levophed
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but TTE on
   admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 10322**]dae tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing
   to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat TTE on [**12-16**]
   was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better appreciate
 per
   interpretation.
   - [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consulted for evaluation of chordae tear, f/u recs

   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp

   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA

   # Neurologic status: Improving.  Following commands, wiggling toes and
   opening eyes to command on [**12-15**]. This AM, sleepy.
   - Continue to follow
   - OT consult for mobility

   # Acute Renal failure:  Resolved, but originally thought to be
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Cr 1.2 on admission, 0.7 today.  BUN
   also improved from [**12-16**] at 45.  Lasix drip stopped on [**12-16**] PM due to
   rising HCO3, that is stable today with > 100cc/hr despite being off
   drip. Patient had previously been hyponatremic on admission that has
   resolved with fluid repletion, but Na continues to rise.  Renal
   continues to follow.

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure presenting with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is improving, with decreasing pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, but has a history of infection and diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules on CT scan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to her underlying chronic heart failure and previous episode of respiratory distress. Close monitoring of her respiratory parameters will be necessary.

2. Shock: Although the patient's shock is nearly resolved, there is still a possibility of recurrence, especially if there is a re-occurrence of infection or cardiogenic insult. Monitoring of CVP, mixed venous saturation, and urine output will help in detecting early signs of shock.

3. Fluid overload: The patient has shown improvement in fluid overload, but careful monitoring of CVP, electrolytes, and renal function is required. Goal diuresis should be maintained at 0.5-1.0 L/day.

4. PUMP dysfunction: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and there may be worsening mitral regurgitation contributing to her symptoms. Close monitoring of cardiac function and follow-up recommendations from cardiology should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of weakness. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and ongoing respiratory support. Levophed was weaned off, and the patient was placed on pressure support before being put back on increased support. There is a moderate left and small right pleural effusion that has worsened slightly since admission. The patient's TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) remains unchanged. Lasix infusion was held due to a high bicarbonate level of 29, but continued to output approximately 100cc/hr. The patient's CVP (central venous pressure) decreased to 4-5 in the evening but rebounded to 8, with steady urine output throughout.

The patient has several allergies, including hydrochlorothiazide, and has been receiving antibiotics such as acyclovir and meropenem. The patient is on multiple infusions, including heparin sodium, and is taking other ICU medications like famotidine (Pepcid). 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the weakness. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/39 to 124/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Patient intubated on [**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.  Patient
   was on CPAP (setting: 5/0) yesterday ([**12-16**]), for 40 minutes but was
   tired and asked to be put back on higher pressure support at 12/5. She
   was switched back to AC overnight to maximize change of extubation
   today.  TTE from [**12-16**] unchanged from prior, chordae & degree of MR
   stable. Pt was extubated on [**12-17**], initially with respiratory distress,
   and per pulm, pt was treated as flash, she was treated lasix bolus,
   morphine, BiPAP and nitro gtt.  Pt improved with the treatment.
   Currently on BiPAP, pt does not want to be re-intubated.  ABG appears
   pt having more respiratory acidosis from hypoventilation.
   - continue BiPAP
   - morphine prn for comfort
   - f/u pulm recs
   - pt does not want to be re-intubated, per ethics, this should be
   patient
s decision
   - Continue current Abx (Meropenem, Doxy, acyclovir) for broad coverage
   - f/u all cx, including final sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, leukocytosis & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down
   steadily. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip
   swab, extensive infectious work-up has been negative to date including
   negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, respiratory panel,
   serologies (CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies, PPD).
   Prelim AFB negative, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. Line tip &
   line site cultures negative. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could
   not be obtained. Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff
   demonstrating immature myelocytes, but smear not convincing and not
   able to confirm with tissue as General Surgery declined LN biopsy.
   Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent lymphoma.
   - Meropenem 500mg TID, day [**10-22**]
   - Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day [**8-22**]
   - Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**3-18**]
   - f/u any daily G Surgery recs; they will biopsy if ""recovers from
   acute event""
   - f/u all other pending cx
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   #. Shock: Pressors weaned completely on [**12-16**]. Thought to be [**1-10**] presumed
   infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR) insult.
   Self-diuresing well.
   - Continue IV Meropenem/Doxycycline/acyclovir for now
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10), Mixed venous sat (goal > 70%), and UOP
   - f/u all outstanding cx
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
) continues to
   improve. Lasix gtt held in context of mild contraction alkalosis. UOP
   good off Lasix gtt.
   -  Goal diuresis is -0.5-1.0L today
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65, if MAP <50, consider restarting low dose Levophed
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but TTE on
   admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 10322**]dae tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing
   to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat TTE on [**12-16**]
   was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better appreciate
 per
   interpretation.
   - [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consulted for evaluation of chordae tear, f/u recs
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp
s tolerate
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Neurologic status: Improving.  Following commands.
   - Continue to follow
   - OT consult for mobility
   .
   # Acute Renal failure:  Resolved, but originally thought to be
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Cr 1.2 on admission, 0.7 today.  BUN
   also improved from [**12-16**] at 45.  Lasix drip stopped on [**12-16**] PM due to
   rising HCO3, that is stable today with > 100cc/hr despite being off
   drip. Patient had previously been hyponatremic on admission that has
   resolved with fluid repletion, but Na continues to rise.  Renal
   continues to follow.
   - Trend Creatinine, HCO3, Na  [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Goal UOP >30cc/hr, patient well above
   -  f/u any Renal recs
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and recent admission for management of heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). She presented with generalized weakness, shortness of breath, and was transferred from Hospital3 to Hospital11 for further management. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has shown improvement in her condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and heart failure, which can contribute to pulmonary edema. Additionally, her recent respiratory distress and the use of BiPAP suggest a potential risk for respiratory failure.
2. Shock: The patient previously required pressors and was treated for presumed infection and cardiogenic shock. However, her condition improved, and the pressors were weaned off.
3. FUO (Fever of Unknown Origin), leukocytosis, and diffuse lymphadenopathy: The patient presented with fever, leukocytosis, and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Although initial infectious work-up was negative, the patient's condition improved with antibiotic therapy. The etiology of these symptoms remains unclear, and further evaluation is needed.
4. Fluid overload: The patient had anasarca and evidence of fluid overload, likely due to hypoalbuminemia, chronic CHF, and leaky capillary syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Patient intubated on [**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.  Patient
   was on CPAP (setting: 5/0) yesterday ([**12-16**]), for 40 minutes but was
   tired and asked to be put back on higher pressure support at 12/5. She
   was switched back to AC overnight to maximize change of extubation
   today.  TTE from [**12-16**] unchanged from prior, [**Month/Day (4) 10178**] & degree of MR
   stable. Pt was extubated on [**12-17**], initially with respiratory distress,
   and per pulm, pt was treated as flash, she was treated lasix bolus,
   morphine, BiPAP and nitro gtt.  Pt improved with the treatment.
   Currently on BiPAP, pt does not want to be re-intubated.  ABG appears
   pt having more respiratory acidosis from hypoventilation.
   - continue face tent for now, BiPAP prn
   - lasix 120mg x 1 now
   - morphine prn for comfort
   - f/u pulm recs
   - pt does not want to be re-intubated, per ethics, this should be
   patient
s decision
   - Continue current Abx (Meropenem, Doxy, acyclovir) for broad coverage
   - f/u all cx, including final sputum cx, AFB cx
   .
   # FUO, leukocytosis & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down
   steadily. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip
   swab, extensive infectious work-up has been negative to date including
   negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, respiratory panel,
   serologies (CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies, PPD).
   Prelim AFB negative, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. Line tip &
   line site cultures negative. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could
   not be obtained. Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff
   demonstrating immature myelocytes, but smear not convincing and not
   able to confirm with tissue as General Surgery declined LN biopsy.
   Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent lymphoma.
   - Meropenem 500mg TID, day [**10-22**]

   infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR) insult.
   Self-diuresing well.
   - Continue IV Meropenem/Doxycycline/acyclovir for now
   - monitor CVP (goal > 10), Mixed venous sat (goal > 70%), and UOP
   - f/u all outstanding cx
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
) continues to
   improve. Lasix gtt held in context of mild contraction alkalosis.
   -  Goal diuresis is -1.0L today, lasix 120mg IV x1 this am
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65, if MAP <50, consider restarting low dose Levophed
   .
   # PUMP: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and pt
s presenting
   sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea, edema), but TTE on
   admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 10322**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely contributing
   to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat TTE on [**12-16**]
   was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better appreciate

   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of AF frequently.  Infection is possible
   cause, but may also be worsened MR (although LA is not significantly
   dilated).  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp

   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA

   # Acute Renal failure:  Resolved, but originally thought to be
   pre-renal with overlying ATN.  Cr 1.2 on admission, 0.7 today.  BUN
   also improved from [**12-16**] at 45.  Lasix drip stopped on [**12-16**] PM due to
   rising HCO3, that is stable today with > 100cc/hr despite being off
   drip. Patient had previously been hyponatremic on admission that has
   resolved with fluid repletion, but Na continues to rise.  Renal
   continues to follow.

   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely from sepsis-associated vasodilatation and
   leaky capillaries, pulmonary edema in the setting of severe MR and
   heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received earlier.
   Patient intubated on [**12-7**] in context of respiratory distress.  Patient
   was on CPAP (setting: 5/0) yesterday ([**12-16**]), for 40 minutes but was
   tired and asked to be put back on higher pressure support at 12/5. She
   was switched back to AC overnight to maximize change of extubation
   today.  TTE from [**12-16**] unchanged from prior, chordae & degree of MR
   stable. Pt was extubated on [**12-17**], initially with respiratory distress,
   and per pulm, pt was treated as flash, she was treated lasix bolus,
   morphine, BiPAP and nitro gtt.  Pt improved with the treatment.
   Currently on BiPAP, pt does not want to be re-intubated.  ABG appears
   pt having more respiratory acidosis from hypoventilation.

   # FUO, leukocytosis & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down
   steadily. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip
   swab, extensive infectious work-up has been negative to date including
   negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, respiratory panel,
   serologies (CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies, PPD).
   Prelim AFB negative, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. Line tip &
   line site cultures negative. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could
   not be obtained. Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff
   demonstrating immature myelocytes, but smear not convincing and not
   able to confirm with tissue as General Surgery declined LN biopsy.
   Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent lymphoma.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the hospital for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's condition has been improving, with less reliance on pressors and improving leukocytosis. However, she still requires respiratory support and is currently on BiPAP. The patient does not want to be re-intubated, and her ABG shows respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and previous intubation suggest a risk of respiratory failure. She is currently on BiPAP, but if hypoventilation persists, she may require re-intubation.
2. Shock: Although the patient's pressors have been weaned completely, there is still a risk of shock due to sepsis-associated vasodilatation and leaky capillaries.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a history of anasarca and chronic systolic CHF, which could lead to fluid overload. Close monitoring of diuresis and electrolyte balance is important.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO), Leukocytosis, and Diffuse Lymphadenopathy: The patient's high-grade fever, leukocytosis, and diffuse lymphadenopathy require further investigation to determine the underlying cause.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function initially deteriorated, but it has improved significantly. Continued monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
6. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, mitral valve regurgitation (MR), and a chordae tear. Ongoing evaluation and management of her cardiac condition are essential.
7. Arrhythmia: The patient frequently experiences episodes of atrial fibrillation. Management of this arrhythmia is crucial to maintain hemodynamic stability.
8. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary artery anatomy is unknown, and there is a possibility of underlying coronary artery disease. Continued monitoring for signs of ischemia or myocardial infarction is important.
9. Neurologic Status: The patient's neurologic status has improved, but ongoing assessment and rehabilitation services are necessary to optimize her functional status.
10. Glaucoma: The patient has a history of glaucoma, and it is important to continue her home eye drops to manage this condition.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of the patient's condition."

   acidosis as a result of hypoventilation (PaCO2 61), put pt on biPAP at
   7pm, lasted for 4 hours
   - ABG continued to show hypoventilation even on biPAP, thought to be
   due to loss of hypoxic respiratory drive (RR down to 10 when PaO2 was
   200), backed down on FiO2, then ABG looked better (PaCO2 54)

   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock

   earlier. Patient intubated on [**12-7**] in context of respiratory
   distress.  Pt was extubated on [**12-17**].  She was on face tent most of the
   time on [**12-18**] but was tiring out so was put on BiPAP for about 4 hours.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and then transferred to this hospital for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's condition has been improving, with less pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis. However, she continues to experience hypercarbic respiratory distress, likely due to decreased tidal volume caused by decreased muscle strength. Her oxygenation has been good, indicating that pulmonary edema is not a significant issue. The patient has diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules on CT scan, but extensive infectious work-up has been negative. The etiology of her fever of unknown origin, leukocytosis, and diffuse lymphadenopathy remains unclear. The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation and a chordae tear at the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Her neurologic status is improving, and she is following commands. The patient's renal function has resolved, and her elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels have normalized. She has anemia consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and her hypothyroidism is well-controlled with levothyroxine. The patient's glaucoma is managed with home eye drops. The patient's daughter prefers a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate status."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2129-12-19**] 02:03 AM
   - s/p lasix 120mg IV x1, given 60mg IV lasix at midnight, not putting
   out much, so ordered another 120mg IV lasix
   - breathing more labored in the evening, ABG showed more respiratory
   acidosis as a result of hypoventilation (PaCO2 61), put pt on biPAP at
   7pm, lasted for 4 hours
   - ABG continued to show hypoventilation even on biPAP, thought to be
   due to loss of hypoxic respiratory drive (RR down to 10 when PaO2 was
   200), backed down on FiO2, then ABG looked better (PaCO2 54)
   - pt asked BiPAP to be removed at 11:30pm, did well.  wanted to drink
   gingerale. had a few sips.  then nurse was out of the room at 1am.
   came back at 1:30am, pt not answering questions, somnolent.  Stat ABG
   showed PaCO2 108, pH 7.12, acutely different from the prior gas. put pt
   back on BiPAP, gas improved, pH 7.32, paCO2 62.   Repeat gas showed
   paCO2 58 and pH 7.35.
   - TF restarted, but held again after being on BiPAP

   Medical Decision Making
   She is having difficulty ventilating, not oxygenating. Causes include
   her effusion, trachemalacia ofter intubation, second hand smoking with
   a component of COPD and mechanical disadvantage from her body habitus.
   We will sit her up to improve mechanical advantage, use BiPAP. Surgery
   will discuss mitral repair, she does not seem amenable.

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), presenting with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was recently admitted to another hospital and transferred here for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She has been improving with less pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive cultures and a CT scan demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: ABG reveals hypoventilation with rising CO2. Decreased muscle strength is the likely etiology for decreased tidal volume. Oxygenation has been great, indicating that pulmonary edema, which causes V/Q mismatch, has not been a limiting issue from the respiratory standpoint. The patient was intubated on [**12-7**] in the context of respiratory distress and extubated on [**12-17**]. She was on a face tent most of the time on [**12-18**] but was tiring out so was put on BiPAP for about 4 hours. Her PaCO2 improved on BiPAP but didn't drop significantly because PaO2 was too high to the 200s, she lost her hypoxic respiratory drive, and RR dropped to around 10. The patient was given lasix 120mg IV x1 yesterday,"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory distress: ABG reveals hypoventilation with
   rising CO2.  Given ventilation = RR x tidal volume, and her RR has been
   around 25-30, this hypoventilation is due to decreased tidal volume.
   Decreased muscle strength is the most likey etiology for decreased
   tidal volume.  Patient's oxygenation has been great, indicating that
   pulmonary edema which causes V/Q mismatch has not been a limiting issue
   from the respiratory stand point.   Pulmonary edema is likely from
   severe MR and heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received
   earlier. Patient intubated on [**12-7**] in context of respiratory
   distress.  Pt was extubated on [**12-17**].  She was on face tent most of the
   time on [**12-18**] but was tiring out so was put on BiPAP for about 4 hours.
   Her PaCO2 improved on BiPAP but didn't drop significantly because PaO2
   was too high to the 200s, she lost her hypoxic respiratory drive, and
   RR dropped to around 10. Patient was given lasix 120mg IV x1 yesterday,
   and 60mg IV lasix x 1 at midnight.
   - continue BiPAP as needed
   - avoid PaO2 being too high
   - avoid morphine as it may exacerbate hypoventilation

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to another hospital and then transferred to this ICU for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been improving, with decreasing pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis. However, she continues to experience hypercarbic respiratory distress, which is likely due to decreased tidal volume caused by muscle weakness. Her oxygenation has been good, indicating that pulmonary edema is not a significant issue. The patient was intubated previously but was successfully extubated on 12/17. She is currently on BiPAP for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The patient's ABG results show hypoventilation with rising CO2 levels. This could be due to decreased tidal volume caused by muscle weakness. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and adjustment of BiPAP settings may be necessary.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has anasarca and continues to improve. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis is essential. Goal diuresis is -1.0L today, with lasix 120mg IV x1 administered this morning.
3. Shock: The patient's pressors were weaned completely on 12/16. It is important to monitor blood pressure and urine output closely.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with history of chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history
   of generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of her
   heart failure and new afib with RVR. She is improving with less pressor
   requirements and improving leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock
   despite no positive cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse
   lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory distress: ABG reveals hypoventilation with
   rising CO2.  Given ventilation = RR x tidal volume, and her RR has been
   around 25-30, this hypoventilation is due to decreased tidal volume.
   Decreased muscle strength is the most likey etiology for decreased
   tidal volume.  Patient's oxygenation has been great, indicating that
   pulmonary edema which causes V/Q mismatch has not been a limiting issue
   from the respiratory stand point.   Pulmonary edema is likely from
   severe MR and heart failure, and the fluid resuscitation she received
   earlier. Patient intubated on [**12-7**] in context of respiratory
   distress.  Pt was extubated on [**12-17**].  She was on face tent most of the
   time on [**12-18**] but was tiring out so was put on BiPAP for about 4 hours.
   Her PaCO2 improved on BiPAP but didn't drop significantly because PaO2
   was too high to the 200s, she lost her hypoxic respiratory drive, and
   RR dropped to around 10. Patient was given lasix 120mg IV x1 yesterday,
   and 60mg IV lasix x 1 at midnight.
   - continue BiPAP as needed
   - avoid PaO2 being too high
   - avoid morphine as it may exacerbate hypoventilation
   - continue standing atrovent nebs
   - lasix 120mg x 1 today for I/O goal of -1L
   - pt does not want to be re-intubated, per ethics, this should be

   # FUO, leukocytosis & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC trending down
   steadily. CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip
   swab, extensive infectious work-up has been negative to date including
   negative urine, stool, sputum, blood cultures, respiratory panel,
   serologies (CMV/EBV/Toxo, anaplasma, rickettsial serologies, PPD).
   Prelim AFB negative, flu negative at OSH, and RF normal. Line tip &
   line site cultures negative. ID felt presentation was unlikely to be
   infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could
   not be obtained. Could also be possible neoplasm given CT scan & diff
   demonstrating immature myelocytes, but smear not convincing and not
   able to confirm with tissue as General Surgery declined LN biopsy.
   Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent lymphoma.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to Hospital 3 and later transferred to Hospital 1 for management of her heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). The patient's condition has shown improvement, with decreasing pressor requirements and improving leukocytosis. However, she still exhibits signs of hypoventilation, as indicated by her rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. This hypoventilation is likely due to decreased tidal volume caused by muscle weakness. The patient's oxygenation has been good, indicating that pulmonary edema is not a limiting factor in her respiratory status. She was intubated on [**12-7**] and extubated on [**12-17**]. The patient was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for about four hours on [**12-18**], which improved her PaCO2 levels but did not significantly decrease due to high PaO2 levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The patient's ABG results show hypoventilation with rising CO2 levels. This could lead to further respiratory acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately.

2. Fluid overload: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of weakness and fatigue. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has multiple medical complications. The patient has been on CPAP, but it was taken off due to improved respiratory status. There is evidence of aspiration, and the patient has been recommended to be NPO with ginger ale swabs. The patient also has mild edema in the right lung, moderate left pleural effusion, and atelectasis that has worsened, reflected in a leftward mediastinal shift. The patient's ABG results show normal pH with respiratory acidosis and appropriate metabolic compensation. The patient has a history of posterior tibial deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but there are concerns about fluid balance and respiratory support. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and right upper extremity edema. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's condition is stable but requires ongoing monitoring and management of respiratory status, fluid balance, and potential complications such as DVT.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: ABG reveals mild metabolic alkalosis
   (contraction) with partial respiratory compensation.  RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with adequate oxygenation all day
   yesterday.  The inadequate respiratory compensation may reflect
   hyperventilation triggered by pulmonary stretch receptors from
   pulmonary edema/MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] received Lasix 120mg IV x 2 yesterday with
   resulting net negative 1900cc. Cardiac surgery saw patient yesterday,
   verbally expressed interest in intervention, but no written recs yet.
   - keep HOB elevated
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - continue standing Atrovent nebs
   - Lasix 120mg x 1 today for I/O goal of -1L
   - Complete Abx (Meropenem, Doxy, Acyclovir) regimen
   - continue TF when not on BiPAP as patient failed S&S yesterday
   .
   # Presumed septic shock & diffuse lymphadenopathy: Thought to be [**1-10**]
   presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR) insult.
   Off pressors since [**12-16**]. WBC still trending down, today 10.9. CT scan
   demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.  Etiology may
   be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip swab, extensive
   infectious work-up has been negative to date.  ID felt presentation was
   unlikely to be infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as
   consent could not be obtained.  Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was
   likely to represent lymphoma.
   - Meropenem 500mg TID, day 13/14,  Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day [**10-22**],
   Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**5-18**]
   - f/u all other pending blood cx
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and
   patient
s initial sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea,
   edema), but TTE on admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with
   known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely
   contributing to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat
   TTE on [**12-16**] was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better

   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), continues to
   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix. CVP
s < 10
   yesterday after PM Lasix dose, but UOP remained strong overnight and
   patient mobilizing fluid into intravascular space well. Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a contraction
   alkalosis.
   -  Goal diuresis is -1.0L today, Lasix 120mg IV x1 this am. Will
   exercise caution to maintain CVP ~ 10 & regulate electrolytes today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt converted from sinus rhythm back to AF yesterday evening.
   Fluid shifts may be responsible, but MR is likely contributing although
   LA is not significantly dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH
   normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp
s tolerate
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Elevated Serum Bicarbonate: Patient originally with ARF
   thought to be pre-renal with overlying ATN that has now resolved.
   Patient had previously been hyponatremic on admission that resolved
   with fluid repletion, but Na & HCO3 now slightly elevated in context of
   Lasix use.
   - Trend Creatinine, HCO3 and Na [**Hospital1 **]
   - goal I/O: -1L today
   - f/u any Renal recs
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient placed on Heparin gtt due to LENI
s performed
   on [**12-8**] demonstrating a possible old DVT in the right posterior tibial
   veins (normal compression, but no appearance of flow). Given patient
   functional status over the past two weeks, this was unable to be
   further assessed.
   - Bilateral LENI
s today to evaluate for DVT
   - If no DVT observed, can transition from Heparin gtt to SQ Heparin TID
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: ABG reveals mild metabolic alkalosis
   (contraction) with partial respiratory compensation.  RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with adequate oxygenation all day
   yesterday.  The inadequate respiratory compensation may reflect
   hyperventilation triggered by pulmonary stretch receptors from
   pulmonary edema/MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] received Lasix 120mg IV x 2 yesterday with
   resulting net negative 1900cc. Cardiac surgery saw patient yesterday,
   verbally expressed interest in intervention, but no written recs yet.
   - keep HOB elevated
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - continue standing Atrovent nebs
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - Complete Abx (Meropenem, Doxy, Acyclovir) regimen
   - continue TF
s if off CPAP
   .
   # Presumed septic shock & diffuse lymphadenopathy: Thought to be [**1-10**]
   presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR) insult.
   Off pressors since [**12-16**]. WBC still trending down, today 10.9. CT scan
   demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.  Etiology may
   be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip swab, extensive
   infectious work-up has been negative to date.  ID felt presentation was
   unlikely to be infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as
   consent could not be obtained.  Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was
   likely to represent lymphoma.
   - Meropenem 500mg TID, day 13/14,  Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day [**10-22**],
   Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**5-18**]
   - f/u all other pending blood cx
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and
   patient
s initial sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea,
   edema), but TTE on admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with
   known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely
   contributing to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat
   TTE on [**12-16**] was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better
   appreciated
 per interpretation.
   - TTE today per verbal Csurg recs
   - F/U additional Csurg recs
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), continues to
   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix. CVP
s < 10
   yesterday after PM Lasix dose, but UOP remained strong overnight and
   patient mobilizing fluid into intravascular space well. Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a contraction
   alkalosis.
   -  Goal diuresis is -1.0L today. Will exercise caution to maintain CVP
   ~ 10 & regulate electrolytes today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt converted from sinus rhythm back to AF yesterday evening.
   Fluid shifts may be responsible, but MR is likely contributing although
   LA is not significantly dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH
   normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp
s tolerate
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Elevated Serum Bicarbonate: Patient originally with ARF
   thought to be pre-renal with overlying ATN that has now resolved.
   Patient had previously been hyponatremic on admission that resolved
   with fluid repletion, but Na & HCO3 now slightly elevated in context of
   Lasix use.
   - Trend Creatinine, HCO3 and Na [**Hospital1 **]
   - goal I/O: -1L today
   - f/u any Renal recs
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient placed on Heparin gtt due to LENI
s performed
   on [**12-8**] demonstrating a possible old DVT in the right posterior tibial
   veins (normal compression, but no appearance of flow). Given patient
   functional status over the past two weeks, this was unable to be
   further assessed.
   - Bilateral LENI
s today to evaluate for DVT if can be done at bedside
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Neurologic status: Improving.  Following commands.
   - Continue to follow
   - OT consult for mobility

   Disposition: pending improvement of respiratory status/evaluation for
   cardiac surgery
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and recent admission for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been improving after intubation and the use of pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has mild metabolic alkalosis with partial respiratory compensation. Her respiratory rate remains in the mid-20s to upper 30s on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula with adequate oxygenation. This indicates ongoing respiratory distress, and close monitoring is necessary.

2. Presumed septic shock and diffuse lymphadenopathy: The patient has a history of presumed infection and cardiogenic insult. Despite negative infectious work-up, the patient has improved on antibiotics. The etiology of the lymphadenopathy may be infection, but it is uncertain. Further evaluation is needed.

3. PUMP/SEVERE MR: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and known mitral regurgitation. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed unchanged findings from the prior TTE, but the jet of mitral regurgitation was better appreciated. Repeat TTE today per verbal cardiology recommendation is advised.

4. Fluid overload: The patient has anasarca fluid imbalance, which continues to improve. However, the patient remains at risk"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was initially admitted to Hospital3 and later transferred to Hospital11 due to worsening heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement after intubation and the use of pressors. She has a marked leukocytosis, which is concerning for septic shock, despite no positive cultures. A CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. The patient's respiratory distress has been managed with supplemental oxygen and diuretics. She also has presumed septic shock and diffuse lymphadenopathy, with an extensive infectious work-up being negative. There is ongoing evaluation for potential causes, including infection and cardiogenic insult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's inadequate respiratory compensation may reflect hyperventilation triggered by pulmonary edema or mitral regurgitation.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix, but there is concern for fluid imbalance due to hypoalbuminemia, chronic systolic heart failure, and leaky capillary syndrome.
3. Rhythm Disturbance: The patient converted from sinus rhythm back to atrial fibrillation yesterday evening, possibly due to fluid shifts or mitral regurgitation.
4. Hypernatremia/Elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.  Patient was extubated on [**12-17**], doing better from respiratory
   stand point, but likely need MVR for full recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, CXR improbing as well.  RR remains in mid 20
s to upper 30
s on
   3L O2 by NC with adequate oxygenation all day yesterday. Patient
   received Lasix 120mg IV x 1 yesterday with resulting net negative
   780cc.  ABG reveals a mix picture of respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis, likely from hypoventilation and overdiuresis/contraction
   alkalosis.  Although pt is improving from the respiratory stand point,
   it is unclear how well she can get without MVR surgery.
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - start lasix gtt today
   - keep HOB elevated, I/O goal of -500cc-1L
   - daily CXR
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - continue standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete Abx (Meropenem, Doxy, Acyclovir) regimen, finishing up
   meropenem today
   - continue TF
   - patient will need S/S re-eval tomorrow.  Currently aspirating.
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  This is most likely contraction alkalosis due
   to overdiuresis.  BUN/Cr ratio is way above 20. No vomiting and loss of
   hydrogen ions from GI system.  No insulin or hypokalemia leading to
   alkalosis either.  Curiously, creatinine has been flat and even
   down-trending despite aggressive diuresis and contraction alkalosis.
   - get urine Cl to see if the metabolic alkalosis is chloride-responsive
   (if Ucl <10, responsive, if >20, not responsive)
   - slow down on diuresis given likely contraction alkalosis, start lasix
   gtt
   - I/O goal of -500cc-1L
   - pm lytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Na climbing to 149 today.  Also likely due to
   overdiuresis. Free water deficit is calculated to be 2.9L.
   - continue free water flushes 200cc q6h
   - slow down on diuresis given likely contraction alkalosis, start lasix

   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), continues to
   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix.  Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a contraction
   alkalosis.
   -  Goal diuresis is -0.5-1.0L today. Will exercise caution to maintain
   CVP ~ 10 & regulate electrolytes today.

better
   appreciated
 per interpretation.  Per Csurgery, no more pre-op testing
   is necessary until pt makes the decision to go for surgery.  Currently,
   patient is still leaning toward no surgery, but this may change as
   patient feels better.
   - need to get OSH dental records
   - f/u on carotid US final read.  The prelim read showed 0% stenosis.
   - continue to discuss surgical option with patient
   - F/U additional Csurg recs
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of Afib.  Fluid shifts may be responsible,
   but MR is the main contributing factor although LA is not significantly
   dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **], will change to amiodarone 200mg

Her labs show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, sodium of 149 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered rhonchi and crackles anteriorly with diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, right lower extremity edema of 2+, left lower extremity edema of 2+, and right upper extremity with 2+ edema. Her neurologic examination is normal, and she is attentive, follows commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, with purposeful movement and normal tone.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing Atrovent nebs, daily CXR, follow-up on carotid US final read, and continuing TF for nutrition. She will also need to be evaluated for cardiac surgery, and her family has been educated about the surgical options. The patient's electrolytes and renal function should be closely monitored, and she should continue to trend CBC. Her DVT will be managed with heparin gtt."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.  Patient was extubated on [**12-17**], doing better from respiratory
   stand point, but likely need MVR for full recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, CXR improbing as well.  RR remains in mid 20
s to upper 30
s on
   3L O2 by NC with adequate oxygenation all day yesterday. Patient
   received Lasix 120mg IV x 1 yesterday with resulting net negative
   780cc.  ABG reveals a mix picture of respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis, likely from hypoventilation and overdiuresis/contraction
   alkalosis.  Although pt is improving from the respiratory stand point,
   it is unclear how well she can get without MVR surgery.
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - start lasix gtt today
   - keep HOB elevated, I/O goal of -500cc-1L
   - daily CXR
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - continue standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete Abx (Meropenem, Doxy, Acyclovir) regimen, finishing up
   meropenem today
   - continue TF
   - patient will need S/S re-eval tomorrow.  Currently aspirating.
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  This is most likely contraction alkalosis due
   to overdiuresis.  BUN/Cr ratio is way above 20. No vomiting and loss of
   hydrogen ions from GI system.  No insulin or hypokalemia leading to
   alkalosis either.  Curiously, creatinine has been flat and even
   down-trending despite aggressive diuresis and contraction alkalosis.
   - get urine Cl to see if the metabolic alkalosis is chloride-responsive
   (if Ucl <10, responsive, if >20, not responsive)
   - slow down on diuresis given likely contraction alkalosis, start lasix
   gtt
   - I/O goal of -500cc-1L
   - pm lytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Na climbing to 149 today.  Also likely due to
   overdiuresis. Free water deficit is calculated to be 2.9L.
   - continue free water flushes 200cc q6h
   - slow down on diuresis given likely contraction alkalosis, start lasix
   gtt
   - I/O goal of -500cc-1L
   - pm lytes
   - f/u on nutrition recs on less concentrated TF
   .
   #. Fluid overload: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), continues to
   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix.  Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a contraction
   alkalosis.
   -  Goal diuresis is -0.5-1.0L today. Will exercise caution to maintain
   CVP ~ 10 & regulate electrolytes today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and
   patient
s initial sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea,
   edema), but TTE on admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with
   known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely
   contributing to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat
   TTE on [**12-16**] was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better
   appreciated
 per interpretation.  Per Csurgery, no more pre-op testing
   is necessary until pt makes the decision to go for surgery.  Currently,
   patient is still leaning toward no surgery, but this may change as
   patient feels better.
   - need to get OSH dental records
   - f/u on carotid US final read.  The prelim read showed 0% stenosis.
   - continue to discuss surgical option with patient
   - F/U additional Csurg recs
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of Afib.  Fluid shifts may be responsible,
   but MR is the main contributing factor although LA is not significantly
   dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **], will change to amiodarone 200mg
   daily tomorrow
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp
s tolerate
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   .
   # Presumed septic shock & diffuse lymphadenopathy: WBC still trending
   down, today 10.4.  Thought to be [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic
   (acute MR, afib with RVR) insult.  Off pressors since [**12-16**]. CT scan
   demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.  Etiology may
   be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip swab, extensive
   infectious work-up has been negative to date.  ID felt presentation was
   unlikely to be infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as
   consent could not be obtained.  Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was
   likely to represent lymphoma.
   - Meropenem 500mg TID, day 14/14,  Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day [**11-21**],
   Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**6-17**]
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 16 days,
   intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].
   - PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - s/s re-eval tomorrow
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have  a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - continue heparin gtt (also for Afib)
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Fe studies c/w ACD
   s/p 2u pRBC
s.  B12 and folate normal.  Hct stable.
   - Trend HCT daily

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2589**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3287**], MD
   on:[**2129-12-22**] 10:10 ------
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and recent history of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to Hospital3 and transferred to Hospital11 due to heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement after being intubated and requiring pressors.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she still requires 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. Her ABG results show a mixed picture of respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, likely due to hypoventilation and overdiuresis/contraction alkalosis. The patient has been diuresing well on IV Lasix, and her fluid overload is improving.

The patient's sodium level is high at 149 mEq/L, which is likely due to overdiuresis. Her HCO3 level is also elevated, indicating a contraction alkalosis. The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is above 20, suggesting prerenal azotemia possibly due to overdiuresis.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic CHF, and her initial symptoms were consistent with failure, but her initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a normal ejection fraction (>60%). She also has known mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be contributing to her worsening MR and overestimation of EF. Repeat TTE on December 16 showed no change from the prior TTE, but the jet of MR was better appreciated. The cardiology team believes that no more pre-op testing is necessary until the patient decides to proceed with surgery.

The patient is currently in and out of AFib, and fluid shifts may be responsible, but MR is the main contributing factor. The patient's TSH level is normal. The patient has presumed septic shock and diffuse lymphadenopathy, with a trending down WBC count. A CT scan demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules, but extensive infectious work-up has been negative to date. The patient is still on antibiotics, and the etiology may be infection, but ID did not feel the presentation was likely to be infectious. Heme/Onc did not feel the presentation was likely to represent lymphoma.

The patient has been in the hospital for 16 days, intubated from December 17. She has an old right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on heparin gtt for AFib and DVT. The patient's coronary anatomy is unknown as she has never had a prior cardiac catheterizations, but myocardial infarction is unlikely given lack of any EKG changes and negative troponins.

The patient has anemia that is normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW, and Fe studies consistent with A"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.  Patient was extubated on [**12-17**], doing better from respiratory
   stand point, but likely need MVR for full recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: ABG reveals a mix picture of respiratory
   acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, likely from hypoventilation and
   overdiuresis/contraction alkalosis.  RR remains in mid 20
s to upper
   30
s on 3L O2 by NC with adequate oxygenation all day yesterday.
   Patient received Lasix 120mg IV x 1 yesterday with resulting net
   negative 780cc.  Patient is improving from respiratory stand point, CXR
   improbing as well.  However, it is unclear how well she can get without
   MVR surgery.
   - f/u Csurg recs

   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  This is most likely contraction alkalosis due
   to overdiuresis.  BUN/Cr ratio is way above 20. No vomiting and loss of
   hydrogen ions from GI system.  No insulin or hypokalemia leading to
   alkalosis either.
   - get urine Cl to see if the metabolic alkalosis is chloride-responsive
   (if Ucl <10, responsive, if >20, not responsive)
   - slow down on diuresis given likely contraction alkalosis
   - I/O goal of -500cc-1L
   - pm lytes

   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Na climbing to 149 today.  Also likely due to
   overdiuresis. Free water deficit is calculated to be 2.9L.

   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix.  Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a contraction
   alkalosis.
   -  Goal diuresis is -0.5-1.0L today. Will exercise caution to maintain
   CVP ~ 10 & regulate electrolytes today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]

   edema), but TTE on admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with
   known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely
   contributing to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat
   TTE on [**12-16**] was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better

   (acute MR, afib with RVR) insult.  Off pressors since [**12-16**]. CT scan
   demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.  Etiology may
   be infection, but aside from HSV positive lip swab, extensive
   infectious work-up has been negative to date.  ID felt presentation was
   unlikely to be infectious, but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as
   consent could not be obtained.  Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was
   likely to represent lymphoma.

   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of Afib.  Fluid shifts may be responsible,
   but MR is the main contributing factor although LA is not significantly
   dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH normal.
   - Continue PO Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, who was admitted with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She has been improving after intubation and the use of pressors, but there is a concern for septic shock despite negative cultures and a CT scan showing diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. 

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she remains in the mid-20s to upper 30s range of respiratory rate on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. The ABG reveals a mixed picture of respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, likely due to hypoventilation and overdiuresis/contraction alkalosis. 

The patient received Lasix 120mg IV with a resulting net negative fluid balance of 780cc. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 109 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 91/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. 

Her physical examination reveals an irregularly irregular heartbeat with normal S1 and S2, a 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the axilla, scattered rhonchi anteriorly with diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, and edema in the lower extrem"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, recent generalized weakness, and shortness of breath. She was admitted to [Hospital3] and later transferred to [Hospital1] for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's respiratory distress has improved, but she still requires supplemental oxygen. Her ABG results indicate a mix of respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, likely due to hypoventilation and overdiuresis/contraction alkalosis. The patient has hypernatremia and hypoalbuminemia, indicating fluid overload. Her cardiac function is compromised, with evidence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and an EF greater than 60%. The patient's medical team is considering surgical options, such as mitral valve repair (MVR), but she is currently leaning towards not undergoing surgery. The patient has had presumed septic shock, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary nodules on CT scan, but extensive infectious work-ups have been negative. She has been intubated for 16 days and is now extubated. The patient also has a possible old DVT in her right posterior tibial vein. Her anemia is normocytic and normochromic with normal RDW, and she has a history of glaucoma and hypothyroidism."

   Imaging: no CXR today
   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.  Patient was extubated on [**12-17**], doing better from respiratory
   stand point, but likely need MVR for full recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, CXR improving as well.  RR remains in mid 20
s to upper 30
s on
   3-4L O2 by NC with adequate oxygen saturation. Patient received Lasix
   bolus (80mg) plus gtt at 2.5mg/hr with good UOP.  However, Lasix gtt
   was held since yesterday evening due to hypotension in the setting of
   getting 50mg trazodone.  ABG reveals metabolic alkalosis, likely
   contraction alkalosis.  Although pt is improving from the respiratory
   stand point, it is unclear how well she can get without MVR surgery.
   - restart lasix gtt today with bolus (80mg), I/O goal of -500cc
   - keep HOB elevated
   - continue standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete Abx (Doxy, Acyclovir) regimen, meropenem d/c
d today
   - continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - per S/S, can have pleasure feeds in moisture purees and nectar
   thickened liquids, but main source of nutrition continues to be TF
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - f/u Csurg recs, if any
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Patient received 50mg trazodone last night at 7pm, was up
   most of the time until 3am.  Daughter and patient herself were very
   concerned about the fact that she was not getting enough sleep.
   - consult geriatrics regarding the best sleeping med for an 83 year
   old, consider remeron, atypical antipsychotics or lower dose trazodone
   - if giving trazodone, no more than 37.5mg
   .
   # HYPOTENSION:  Patient was hypotensive after trazodone was given.  The
   most likely etiology was medication effect. 1-10% patients develop
   hypotension after receiving trazodone.  Other etiologies were
   unlikely.  Patient has been on heparin, so PE is unlikely.  ACS
   unlikely as patient asymptomatic, and patient has no history of ACS.
   Her coronary artery anatomy is unknown, but her plaque burden in
   carotid arteries is close to 0.  Pneumothorax was not seen in CXR after
   PICC was placed, and she had bilateral breath sounds, and was satting
   well.
   - If giving trazodone, no more than 37.5mg
   - look for another sleeping medication as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  This is most likely due to Lasix diuresis and
   contraction alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio is way above 20. Curiously,
   creatinine has been flat and even down-trending despite aggressive
   diuresis and contraction alkalosis.  FeUrea: 29.7, Urine osm 563, serum
   osm: 321, these numbers indicate patient is not very dry.  Urine Na
   20.  Urine Cl: 24 (>20), indicating less Cl-responsiveness.  No other
   etiologies can explain this metabolic alkalosi, patient has no vomiting
   and loss of hydrogen ions from GI system, and no insulin or hypokalemia
   leading to alkalosis either.
   - restart lasix gtt today with bolus (80mg), I/O goal of -500cc
   - pm lytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Na stable.  TF was changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control.  Hypernatremia is likely due to diuresis. Free water
   deficit is calculated to be 2.9L.
   - continue free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - restart lasix gtt today with bolus (80mg), I/O goal of -500cc
   - pm lytes
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), continues to
   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix gtt.  Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a Lasix effect and
   contraction alkalosis.
   -  Goal diuresis is -0.5L today. Will exercise caution to maintain CVP
   ~ 10 & regulate electrolytes today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 17 days,
   intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   # Anemia/Hct drop: Hct dropped to 27.9 to 25.5 over 24 hours.  Part of
   this is due to hemodilution given the 1L NS she received overnight due
   to hypotension.  Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Fe studies
   c/w ACD s/p 2u pRBC
s during the earlier part of this hospital stay.
   B12 and folate normal.
   - guaiac all stools
   - Trend HCT daily
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC bumped up from a nadir of 10.4 yesterday ([**2129-12-21**])
   to 12.5 today.  Patient is afebrile, no sign of localized infection.
   Her peak WBC during this admission was 49.1.  This was thought to be
   [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR)
   insult.  Off pressors since [**12-16**]. CT scan demonstrated diffuse
   lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but
   aside from HSV positive lip swab, extensive infectious work-up has been
   negative to date.  ID felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious,
   but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could not be
   obtained.  Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent
   lymphoma.
   - meropenem d/c
d today
   - Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day 13/14, Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**7-18**]
   - if fever, would culture and get CXR
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and
   patient
s initial sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea,
   edema), but TTE on admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with
   known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely
   contributing to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat
   TTE on [**12-16**] was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better
   appreciated
 per interpretation.  Per Csurgery, no more pre-op testing
   is necessary until pt makes the decision to go for surgery.  Currently,
   patient is still leaning toward no surgery, but this may change as
   patient feels better.
   - continue to discuss surgical option with patient
   - F/U Csurg recs, if any
   - need to get OSH dental records if pt decides to go for MVR
   - carotid US showed 0% stenosis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of Afib.  Fluid shifts may be responsible,
   but MR is the main contributing factor although LA is not significantly
   dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH normal.
   - change amiodarone from 200mg [**Hospital1 **] to 200mg daily
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp
s tolerate
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - continue heparin gtt (also for Afib)
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA 81mg daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic congestive heart failure and a recent history of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to the hospital and transferred to the ICU for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently improving after intubation and receiving pressors, but there are concerns for septic shock despite no positive cultures and a CT scan showing diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. The patient has been extubated and is on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. She is expected to undergo mitral valve repair surgery but may need to be evaluated by a neurologist regarding her insomnia. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, fluid overload, anemia, leukocytosis, and deconditioning. She also has a history of glaucoma and hypothyroidism. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), acyclovir, doxycycline, and meropenem. The plan is to restart Lasix gtt with a bolus, elevate the head of the bed, continue Atrovent nebs, complete the antibiotic regimen, and follow up with cardiology recommendations."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.  Patient was extubated on [**12-17**], doing better from respiratory
   stand point, but likely need MVR for full recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, CXR improving as well.  RR remains in mid 20
s to upper 30
s on
   3-4L O2 by NC with adequate oxygen saturation. Patient received Lasix
   bolus (80mg) plus gtt at 2.5mg/hr with good UOP.  However, Lasix gtt
   was held since yesterday evening due to hypotension in the setting of
   getting 50mg trazodone.  ABG reveals metabolic alkalosis, likely
   contraction alkalosis.  Although pt is improving from the respiratory
   stand point, it is unclear how well she can get without MVR surgery.
   - restart lasix gtt today with bolus (80mg), I/O goal of -500cc
   - keep HOB elevated
   - continue standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete Abx (Doxy, Acyclovir) regimen, meropenem d/c
d today
   - continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - per S/S, can have pleasure feeds in moisture purees and nectar
   thickened liquids, but main source of nutrition continues to be TF
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - f/u Csurg recs, if any
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Patient received 50mg trazodone last night at 7pm, was up
   most of the time until 3am.  Daughter and patient herself were very
   concerned about the fact that she was not getting enough sleep.
   - consult geriatrics regarding the best sleeping med for an 83 year
   old, consider remeron, atypical antipsychotics or lower dose trazodone
   - if giving trazodone, no more than 37.5mg
   .
   # HYPOTENSION:  Patient was hypotensive after trazodone was given.  The
   most likely etiology was medication effect. 1-10% patients develop
   hypotension after receiving trazodone.  Other etiologies were
   unlikely.  Patient has been on heparin, so PE is unlikely.  ACS
   unlikely as patient asymptomatic, and patient has no history of ACS.
   Her coronary artery anatomy is unknown, but her plaque burden in
   carotid arteries is close to 0.  Pneumothorax was not seen in CXR after
   PICC was placed, and she had bilateral breath sounds, and was satting
   well.
   - If giving trazodone, no more than 37.5mg
   - look for another sleeping medication as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  This is most likely due to Lasix diuresis and
   contraction alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio is way above 20. Curiously,
   creatinine has been flat and even down-trending despite aggressive
   diuresis and contraction alkalosis.  FeUrea: 29.7, Urine osm 563, serum
   osm: 321, these numbers indicate patient is not very dry.  Urine Na
   20.  Urine Cl: 24 (>20), indicating less Cl-responsiveness.  No other
   etiologies can explain this metabolic alkalosi, patient has no vomiting
   and loss of hydrogen ions from GI system, and no insulin or hypokalemia
   leading to alkalosis either.
   - restart lasix gtt today with bolus (80mg), I/O goal of -500cc
   - pm lytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Na stable.  TF was changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control.  Hypernatremia is likely due to diuresis. Free water
   deficit is calculated to be 2.9L.
   - continue free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - restart lasix gtt today with bolus (80mg), I/O goal of -500cc
   - pm lytes
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), continues to
   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix gtt.  Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a Lasix effect and
   contraction alkalosis.
   -  Goal diuresis is -0.5L today. Will exercise caution to maintain CVP
   ~ 10 & regulate electrolytes today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 17 days,
   intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   # Anemia/Hct drop: Hct dropped to 27.9 to 25.5 over 24 hours.  Part of
   this is due to hemodilution given the 1L NS she received overnight due
   to hypotension.  Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Fe studies
   c/w ACD s/p 2u pRBC
s during the earlier part of this hospital stay.
   B12 and folate normal.
   - guaiac all stools
   - Trend HCT daily
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC bumped up from a nadir of 10.4 yesterday ([**2129-12-21**])
   to 12.5 today.  Patient is afebrile, no sign of localized infection.
   Her peak WBC during this admission was 49.1.  This was thought to be
   [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR)
   insult.  Off pressors since [**12-16**]. CT scan demonstrated diffuse
   lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but
   aside from HSV positive lip swab, extensive infectious work-up has been
   negative to date.  ID felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious,
   but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could not be
   obtained.  Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent
   lymphoma.
   - meropenem d/c
d today
   - Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day 13/14, Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**7-18**]
   - if fever, would culture and get CXR
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and
   patient
s initial sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea,
   edema), but TTE on admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with
   known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely
   contributing to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat
   TTE on [**12-16**] was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better
   appreciated
 per interpretation.  Per Csurgery, no more pre-op testing
   is necessary until pt makes the decision to go for surgery.  Currently,
   patient is still leaning toward no surgery, but this may change as
   patient feels better.
   - continue to discuss surgical option with patient
   - F/U Csurg recs, if any
   - need to get OSH dental records if pt decides to go for MVR
   - carotid US showed 0% stenosis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of Afib.  Fluid shifts may be responsible,
   but MR is the main contributing factor although LA is not significantly
   dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH normal.
   - change amiodarone from 200mg [**Hospital1 **] to 200mg daily
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp
s tolerate
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - continue heparin gtt (also for Afib)
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 3.3
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and recent admission for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). She was intubated and required pressors, which improved her respiratory status. However, she still requires assistance with breathing and is on oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient has a history of generalized weakness, shortness of breath, and leukocytosis, but no positive cultures. A CT scan showed diffuse lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules. The patient's Hct dropped from 29.7 to 25.5 over 24 hours, indicating possible anemia. She has leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, and hypernatremia. The patient's fluid balance is improving, but she still has edema in both lower extremities. She has been in the hospital for 17 days and is deconditioned. The patient's surgical options for mitral valve repair (MVR) are being discussed, and she is currently leaning towards no surgery. Her rhythm is primarily AFib, but she has had periods of normal sinus rhythm. The patient has a history of glaucoma, hypothyroidism, and hypoglycemia. She is on multiple medications including heparin, furosemide (Lasix), trazodone, and atropine. Her disposition is pending improvement"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.  Patient was extubated on [**12-17**], doing better from respiratory
   stand point, but likely need MVR for full recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, CXR improving as well.  RR remains in mid 20
s to upper 30
s on
   3-4L O2 by NC with adequate oxygen saturation. Patient received Lasix
   bolus (80mg) plus gtt at 2.5mg/hr with good UOP.  However, Lasix gtt
   was held since yesterday evening due to hypotension in the setting of
   getting 50mg trazodone.  ABG reveals metabolic alkalosis, likely
   contraction alkalosis.  Although pt is improving from the respiratory
   stand point, it is unclear how well she can get without MVR surgery.
   - restart lasix gtt today at 10mg/hr.  Assess at noon time today, will
   give Lasix bolus 80mg if UOP <80cc/hr.  Goal I/O -500cc today.
   - keep HOB elevated
   - continue standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete Abx (Doxy, Acyclovir) regimen, meropenem d/c
d today
   - continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - per S/S, can have pleasure feeds in moisture purees and nectar
   thickened liquids, but main source of nutrition continues to be TF
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - f/u Csurg recs, if any
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Patient received 50mg trazodone last night at 7pm, was up
   most of the time until 3am.  Daughter and patient herself were very
   concerned about the fact that she was not getting enough sleep.  Other
   meds that have been considered include remeron, Ativan, ambien,
   atypical antipsychotics or lower dose trazodone
   - give remeron 15mg and Ativan prn for sleep tonight.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION:  Patient was hypotensive after trazodone was given.  The
   most likely etiology was medication effect. 1-10% patients develop
   hypotension after receiving trazodone.  Other etiologies were
   unlikely.  Patient has been on heparin, so PE is unlikely.  ACS
   unlikely as patient asymptomatic, and patient has no history of ACS.
   Her coronary artery anatomy is unknown, but her plaque burden in
   carotid arteries is close to 0.  Pneumothorax was not seen in CXR after
   PICC was placed, and she had bilateral breath sounds, and was satting
   well.
   - give remeron and low dose ativan for sleep
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  This is most likely due to Lasix diuresis and
   contraction alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio is way above 20. Curiously,
   creatinine has been flat and even down-trending despite aggressive
   diuresis and contraction alkalosis.  FeUrea: 29.7, Urine osm 563, serum
   osm: 321, urine Na 20,  these numbers indicate patient is not terribly
   dry.  Urine Cl: 24 (>20), indicating less Cl-responsiveness.  No other
   etiologies can explain this metabolic alkalosi, patient has no vomiting
   and loss of hydrogen ions from GI system, and no insulin or hypokalemia
   leading to alkalosis either.
   - restart lasix gtt today at 10mg/hr.  Assess at noon time today, will
   give Lasix bolus 80mg if UOP <80cc/hr.  goal I/O -500cc today.
   - pm lytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Na stable.  TF was changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control.  Hypernatremia is likely due to diuresis. Free water
   deficit continues to be 2.9L.
   - continue free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - restart lasix gtt today at 10mg/hr.  Assess at noon time today, will
   give Lasix bolus 80mg if UOP <80cc/hr.  Goal I/O -500cc today.
   - pm lytes
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), continues to
   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix gtt.  Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a Lasix effect and
   contraction alkalosis.
   -  restart lasix gtt today at 10mg/hr.  Assess at noon time today, will
   give Lasix bolus 80mg if UOP <80cc/hr.  goal I/O -500cc today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 17 days,
   intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   # Anemia/Hct drop: Hct dropped to 27.9 to 25.5 over 24 hours.  Part of
   this is due to hemodilution given the 1L NS she received overnight due
   to hypotension.  Also PICC line was placed yesterday which could have
   caused some blood loss.   Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Fe
   studies c/w ACD s/p 2u pRBC
s during the earlier part of this hospital
   stay.  B12 and folate normal.
   - guaiac all stools
   - send for c.diff
   - get pm hct, goal hct 21
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC bumped up from a nadir of 10.4 yesterday ([**2129-12-21**])
   to 12.5 today.  Patient is afebrile, no sign of localized infection.
   Her peak WBC during this admission was 49.1.  This was thought to be
   [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR)
   insult.  Off pressors since [**12-16**]. CT scan demonstrated diffuse
   lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but
   aside from HSV positive lip swab, extensive infectious work-up has been
   negative to date.  ID felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious,
   but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could not be
   obtained.  Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent
   lymphoma.
   - meropenem d/c
d today
   - send c.diff
   - Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day 13/14, Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**7-18**]
   - if fever, would culture and get CXR.  Would start vanc and flagyl,
   pull out CVL if febrile.
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and
   patient
s initial sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea,
   edema), but TTE on admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with
   known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely
   contributing to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat
   TTE on [**12-16**] was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better
   appreciated
 per interpretation.  Per Csurgery, no more pre-op testing
   is necessary until pt makes the decision to go for surgery.  Currently,
   patient does not want surgery currently, but this may change as patient
   feels better.
   - continue to discuss surgical option with patient when she feels
   better
   - F/U Csurg recs, if any
   - need to get OSH dental records if pt decides to go for MVR
   - carotid US showed 0% stenosis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of Afib.  Fluid shifts may be responsible,
   but MR is the main contributing factor although LA is not significantly
   dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH normal.
   - change amiodarone from 200mg [**Hospital1 **] to 200mg daily
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp
s tolerate
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   - start coumadin 2.5mg daily
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - continue heparin gtt (also for Afib)
   - start coumadin 2.5mg daily
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 3.3
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to the hospital and later transferred to this ICU due to heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been improving after intubation and the use of pressors, but there are concerns for septic shock despite negative cultures and a CT scan showing diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and her ABG reveals metabolic alkalosis, likely due to contraction alkalosis from diuresis. The patient's sodium levels are stable, but there is a concern for fluid overload, which is improving with the use of IV Lasix gtt. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 29.7 to 25.5 over 24 hours, possibly due to hemodilution from fluid administration and blood loss during PICC line placement. The patient's leukocyte count has increased, but there are no signs of localized infection.

The patient's medical history includes chronic systolic CHF, anemia, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, glaucoma, and a possible old deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right posterior tibial vein. The patient's coronary artery anatomy is unknown, but her plaque burden in the carotid arteries is close to 0"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic systolic CHF with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, recently admitted to
   [**Hospital3 **] now transferred here to [**Hospital1 1**] for heart failure and new
   afib with RVR. She is improving after intubation requiring pressors and
   a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive
   cultures and a CT demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary
   nodules.  Patient was extubated on [**12-17**], doing better from respiratory
   stand point, but likely need MVR for full recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, CXR improving as well.  RR remains in mid 20
s to upper 30
s on
   3-4L O2 by NC with adequate oxygen saturation. Patient received Lasix
   bolus (80mg) plus gtt at 2.5mg/hr with good UOP.  However, Lasix gtt
   was held since yesterday evening due to hypotension in the setting of
   getting 50mg trazodone.  ABG reveals metabolic alkalosis, likely
   contraction alkalosis.  Although pt is improving from the respiratory
   stand point, it is unclear how well she can get without MVR surgery.
   - restart lasix gtt today at 10mg/hr.  Assess at noon time today, will
   give Lasix bolus 80mg if UOP <80cc/hr.  Goal I/O -500cc today.
   - keep HOB elevated
   - continue standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete Abx (Doxy, Acyclovir) regimen, meropenem d/c
d today
   - continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - per S/S, can have pleasure feeds in moisture purees and nectar
   thickened liquids, but main source of nutrition continues to be TF
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - f/u Csurg recs, if any
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Patient received 50mg trazodone last night at 7pm, was up
   most of the time until 3am.  Daughter and patient herself were very
   concerned about the fact that she was not getting enough sleep.  Other
   meds that have been considered include remeron, Ativan, ambien,
   atypical antipsychotics or lower dose trazodone
   - give remeron 15mg and Ativan prn for sleep tonight.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION:  Patient was hypotensive after trazodone was given.  The
   most likely etiology was medication effect. 1-10% patients develop
   hypotension after receiving trazodone.  Other etiologies were
   unlikely.  Patient has been on heparin, so PE is unlikely.  ACS
   unlikely as patient asymptomatic, and patient has no history of ACS.
   Her coronary artery anatomy is unknown, but her plaque burden in
   carotid arteries is close to 0.  Pneumothorax was not seen in CXR after
   PICC was placed, and she had bilateral breath sounds, and was satting
   well.
   - give remeron and low dose ativan for sleep
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  This is most likely due to Lasix diuresis and
   contraction alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio is way above 20. Curiously,
   creatinine has been flat and even down-trending despite aggressive
   diuresis and contraction alkalosis.  FeUrea: 29.7, Urine osm 563, serum
   osm: 321, urine Na 20,  these numbers indicate patient is not terribly
   dry.  Urine Cl: 24 (>20), indicating less Cl-responsiveness.  No other
   etiologies can explain this metabolic alkalosi, patient has no vomiting
   and loss of hydrogen ions from GI system, and no insulin or hypokalemia
   leading to alkalosis either.
   - restart lasix gtt today at 10mg/hr.  Assess at noon time today, will
   give Lasix bolus 80mg if UOP <80cc/hr.  goal I/O -500cc today.
   - pm lytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Na stable.  TF was changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control.  Hypernatremia is likely due to diuresis. Free water
   deficit continues to be 2.9L.
   - continue free water flushes 250cc q6h
   - restart lasix gtt today at 10mg/hr.  Assess at noon time today, will
   give Lasix bolus 80mg if UOP <80cc/hr.  Goal I/O -500cc today.
   - pm lytes
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), continues to
   improve. Patient continues to diurese well on IV Lasix gtt.  Also with
   mildly elevated serum Na and HCO3 that may represent a Lasix effect and
   contraction alkalosis.
   -  restart lasix gtt today at 10mg/hr.  Assess at noon time today, will
   give Lasix bolus 80mg if UOP <80cc/hr.  goal I/O -500cc today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 17 days,
   intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   # Anemia/Hct drop: Hct dropped to 27.9 to 25.5 over 24 hours.  Part of
   this is due to hemodilution given the 1L NS she received overnight due
   to hypotension.  Also PICC line was placed yesterday which could have
   caused some blood loss.   Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. Fe
   studies c/w ACD s/p 2u pRBC
s during the earlier part of this hospital
   stay.  B12 and folate normal.
   - guaiac all stools
   - send for c.diff
   - get pm hct, goal hct 21
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC bumped up from a nadir of 10.4 yesterday ([**2129-12-21**])
   to 12.5 today.  Patient is afebrile, no sign of localized infection.
   Her peak WBC during this admission was 49.1.  This was thought to be
   [**1-10**] presumed infection and cardiogenic (acute MR, afib with RVR)
   insult.  Off pressors since [**12-16**]. CT scan demonstrated diffuse
   lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules.  Etiology may be infection, but
   aside from HSV positive lip swab, extensive infectious work-up has been
   negative to date.  ID felt presentation was unlikely to be infectious,
   but has improved on Abx. HIV not tested as consent could not be
   obtained.  Heme/Onc did not feel presentation was likely to represent
   lymphoma.
   - meropenem d/c
d today
   - send c.diff
   - Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day 13/14, Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**7-18**]
   - if fever, would culture and get CXR.  Would start vanc and flagyl,
   pull out CVL if febrile.
   - continue to trend CBC
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: History of chronic systolic heart failure, and
   patient
s initial sx were consistent with failure (SOB, orthopnea,
   edema), but TTE on admission showed normal EF (>60%). Patient also with
   known MR [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10178**] tear at posterior leaflet of mitral valve, likely
   contributing to worsening MR which causes overestimation of EF. Repeat
   TTE on [**12-16**] was unchanged from prior, but jet of MR was
better
   appreciated
 per interpretation.  Per Csurgery, no more pre-op testing
   is necessary until pt makes the decision to go for surgery.  Currently,
   patient does not want surgery currently, but this may change as patient
   feels better.
   - continue to discuss surgical option with patient when she feels
   better
   - F/U Csurg recs, if any
   - need to get OSH dental records if pt decides to go for MVR
   - carotid US showed 0% stenosis
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt goes in and out of Afib.  Fluid shifts may be responsible,
   but MR is the main contributing factor although LA is not significantly
   dilated given prominent regurgitant jet.  TSH normal.
   - change amiodarone from 200mg [**Hospital1 **] to 200mg daily
   - Holding nodal agents in the setting of hypotension, but can restart
   if bp
s tolerate
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   - start coumadin 2.5mg daily
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - continue heparin gtt (also for Afib)
   - start coumadin 2.5mg daily
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has unknown anatomy as she has never had a prior
   cardiac catherizations, but MI is unlikely given lack of any EKG
   changes and negative troponins.
   - continue ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 3.3
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

   Disposition: pending improvement of respiratory status
","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, recently admitted for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is improving after intubation, requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive cultures and a CT scan demonstrating diffuse lymphadenopathy with pulmonary nodules. The patient was extubated on [12-17] and has been doing better from a respiratory standpoint, but likely needs mitral valve replacement for full recovery.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is improving from a respiratory standpoint, but it is unclear how well she can maintain without mitral valve replacement surgery. Lasix gtt was restarted at 10mg/hr, and the goal is to assess at noon today, with plans to give Lasix bolus 80mg if urine output (UOP) is less than 80cc/hr. The goal I/O is -500cc today. The head of bed (HOB) should be elevated, and Atrovent nebs should be continued. ABGs and respiratory status should be closely monitored.

2. Insomnia: The patient received 50mg trazodone last night at 7pm and was up most of the time until 3am. The daughter and patient were very concerned about the lack of sleep. Other medications considered include remeron, ativan"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient
   tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  ABG with
   unchanged metabolic alkalosis, likely contraction from diuresis.
   Overall, while O2 can be weaned somewhat, patient appears to be nearing
   a plateau in regard to respiratory progress. As patient has decided not
   to proceed with MVR surgery, discussion should be had regarding plan
   for disposition (home vs. rehab) and expectations for rehabilitation.
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   - S/S to re-evaluate today. If pt passes S&S, can remove NG tube.
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete 14 day course of Doxycycline 100mg q12H today
   - Continue Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**8-18**]
   - Continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 18
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient significantly
   deconditioned and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve
   repair/replacement, it is unclear how much she will be able to
   rehabilitate from her current state. Physical therapy has begun working
   with her, but they are not able to provide the kind of intensive
   therapy that she would benefit from in a formal rehab facility.
   - Discussion with patient & family plan for disposition
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), slowly
   improving. Patient diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting
   hypernatremia & elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable
   since restarting Lasix gtt on [**12-22**].
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr.  Goal I/O -500cc to -1L today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10, MAP goal is 60-65
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr for now
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control & free water flushes increased.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Stable at 12.7, from 12.5 yesterday. Nadir 10.4 on
   [**2129-12-21**]. Patient is afebrile, no sign of localized infection.  C. diff
   sent on [**12-22**] for diarrhea was negative.  Lines do not appear infected.
   CT scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules, but has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.
   - Consider whether re-imaging would be helpful to assess need for
   further work-up and whether this meets patient
s own goals for care.
   - Complete Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day 14/14
   - Continue Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**8-18**]
   - Trend daily CBC
   .
   # Anemia of chronic inflammation:  Stable at 27.3, rebounded from 25.5
   on [**12-22**]. Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. B12 and folate
   normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # CARDIAC:
   PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   RHYTHM: Patient remains in AF.  On Amiodarone 200mg daily. On Heparin
   gtt bridge to Coumadin. Continue Coumadin 2.5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]).
   Will D/C Heparin gtt when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this admission.
   Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS without adverse side
   effects aside from residual somnolence this AM, but patient easily
   rousable.
   - Continue Mirtazapine 15mg qHS and Ativan 0.5mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Coumadin 2.5mg qHS (goal INR [**1-11**])

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (EF >60%) and recent admission for heart failure exacerbation. She presented with generalized weakness, shortness of breath, and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. After intubation and pressors, her respiratory status improved, but she remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway challenging. The patient has been refusing mitral valve surgery needed for full recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is still concerning due to deconditioning and aspiration risk. She may experience further respiratory distress if unable to clear her airway effectively.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has anasarca (generalized edema) and fluid imbalance, which is slowly improving with diuresis on IV Lasix. However, there is a risk of electrolyte imbalances and renal dysfunction.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has stable metabolic alkalosis likely caused by Lasix diuresis and contraction alkalosis. Close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are stable but remain elevated. Adjustments to Lasix gtt and free water flushes may be needed to manage this condition.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable and slightly elevated. Afebrile and without signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient
   tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  ABG with
   unchanged metabolic alkalosis, likely contraction from diuresis.
   Overall, while O2 can be weaned somewhat, patient appears to be nearing
   a plateau in regard to respiratory progress. As patient has decided not
   to proceed with MVR surgery, discussion should be had regarding plan
   for disposition (home vs. rehab) and expectations for rehabilitation.
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   - S/S to re-evaluate today. If pt passes S&S, can remove NG tube.
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete 14 day course of Doxycycline 100mg q12H today
   - Continue Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**8-18**]
   - Continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 18
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient significantly
   deconditioned and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve
   repair/replacement, it is unclear how much she will be able to
   rehabilitate from her current state. Physical therapy has begun working
   with her, but they are not able to provide the kind of intensive
   therapy that she would benefit from in a formal rehab facility.
   - Discussion with patient & family plan for disposition
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), slowly
   improving. Patient diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting
   hypernatremia & elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable
   since restarting Lasix gtt on [**12-22**].
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr.  Goal I/O -500cc to -1L today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10, MAP goal is 60-65
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr for now
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control & free water flushes increased.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Stable at 12.7, from 12.5 yesterday. Nadir 10.4 on
   [**2129-12-21**]. Patient is afebrile, no sign of localized infection.  C. diff
   sent on [**12-22**] for diarrhea was negative.  Lines do not appear infected.
   CT scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules, but has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.
   - Consider whether re-imaging would be helpful to assess need for
   further work-up and whether this meets patient
s own goals for care.
   - Complete Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day 14/14
   - Continue Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**8-18**]
   - Trend daily CBC
   .
   # Anemia of chronic inflammation:  Stable at 27.3, rebounded from 25.5
   on [**12-22**]. Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. B12 and folate
   normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # CARDIAC:
   PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   RHYTHM: Patient remains in AF.  On Amiodarone 200mg daily. On Heparin
   gtt bridge to Coumadin. Continue Coumadin 2.5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]).
   Will D/C Heparin gtt when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this admission.
   Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS without adverse side
   effects aside from residual somnolence this AM, but patient easily
   rousable.
   - Continue Mirtazapine 15mg qHS and Ativan 0.5mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Coumadin 2.5mg qHS (goal INR [**1-11**])
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient
   tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  ABG with
   unchanged metabolic alkalosis, likely contraction from diuresis.
   Overall, while O2 can be weaned somewhat, patient appears to be nearing
   a plateau in regard to respiratory progress. As patient has decided not
   to proceed with MVR surgery, discussion should be had regarding plan
   for disposition (home vs. rehab) and expectations for rehabilitation.
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   - S/S to re-evaluate today. If pt passes S&S, can remove NG tube.
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - standing Atrovent nebs
   - Complete 14 day course of Doxycycline 100mg q12H today
   - Continue Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**8-18**]
   - Continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 18
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient significantly
   deconditioned and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve
   repair/replacement, it is unclear how much she will be able to
   rehabilitate from her current state. Physical therapy has begun working
   with her, but they are not able to provide the kind of intensive
   therapy that she would benefit from in a formal rehab facility.
   - Discussion with patient & family plan for disposition
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), slowly
   improving. Patient diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting
   hypernatremia & elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable
   since restarting Lasix gtt on [**12-22**].
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr.  Goal I/O -500cc to -1L today.
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  Daily CXR
   -  CVP goal >10, MAP goal is 60-65
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr for now
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control & free water flushes increased.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Stable at 12.7, from 12.5 yesterday. Nadir 10.4 on
   [**2129-12-21**]. Patient is afebrile, no sign of localized infection.  C. diff
   sent on [**12-22**] for diarrhea was negative.  Lines do not appear infected.
   CT scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules, but has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.
   - Consider whether re-imaging would be helpful to assess need for
   further work-up and whether this meets patient
s own goals for care.
   - Complete Doxycycline 100mg q12H, day 14/14
   - Continue Acyclovir 400mg TID, day [**8-18**]
   - Trend daily CBC
   .
   # Anemia of chronic inflammation:  Stable at 27.3, rebounded from 25.5
   on [**12-22**]. Normocytic, normochromic with normal RDW. B12 and folate
   normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # CARDIAC:
   PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   RHYTHM: Patient remains in AF.  On Amiodarone 200mg daily. On Heparin
   gtt bridge to Coumadin. Continue Coumadin 2.5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]).
   Will D/C Heparin gtt when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this admission.
   Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS without adverse side
   effects aside from residual somnolence this AM, but patient easily
   rousable.
   - Continue Mirtazapine 15mg qHS and Ativan 0.5mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Coumadin 2.5mg qHS (goal INR [**1-11**])
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (EF >60%) who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was transferred to the hospital for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been improving after intubation and requires pressors. She is currently extubated and tolerating Lasix gtt at 10 mg/hr well. Her respiratory status has improved, but she remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway challenging and aspiration risk significant. The patient's leukocytosis is stable, and she does not have any signs of localized infection. She has hypernatremia, which is stable, and metabolic alkalosis due to contraction from diuresis. The patient is refusing mitral valve repair/replacement surgery, and it is unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current state. Fluid overload is improving, but she still has anasarca. The patient's cardiac function remains stable, and she is in atrial fibrillation on amiodarone. She is on heparin gtt as a bridge to Coumadin. The patient has insomnia, which improved with Mirtazapine, and she has a possible old right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She also has glaucoma and hypothyroidism, both of which are being managed at home. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway challenging and aspiration risk significant. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary. Regular suctioning of the airway and positioning may be required to prevent aspiration.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has anasarca and a history of chronic systolic heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance, daily weight, and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent fluid overload. Diuretics may be continued to maintain fluid goals.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has stable hypernatremia. Frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels and adjustment of Lasix gtt PRN are necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is stable, but ongoing surveillance for signs of infection is crucial. Regular trend of daily CBC and prompt investigation of any suspected infection are necessary.

5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis due to contraction from diuresis. Close monitoring of bicarbonate levels and electrolyte imbalances is required. Adjustments to diuretic therapy may be necessary.

6. Right Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a possible old DVT. Continued use of anticoagulation therapy with heparin gtt and Coumadin is essential to prevent clot progression"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including changes in medications, such as starting Coumadin for AF, replacing the PICC line, and adjusting Lasix gtt. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for low blood pressure. She is experiencing some fluid balance issues, with a negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels. She has a history of allergies to hydrochlorothiazide and a rash. The patient's physical examination reveals blood-crusted lesions along the lower lip and vermilion border, but no active bleeding or erosions. The patient is alert and oriented, with purposeful movement in all extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may increase the risk of hypotension and inadequate perfusion to vital organs.
2. Fluid Balance Imbalance: The negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours indicates that the patient is losing more fluids than she is receiving. This imbalance can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Infection: The presence of blood-crusted lesions along the lower lip and vermilion border raises the possibility of an infection, such as herpes"

   CXR (from today): pending
   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient
   tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  Overall,
   while O2 can be weaned somewhat, patient appears to be nearing a
   plateau in regard to respiratory progress. As patient has decided not
   to proceed with MVR surgery, discussion should be had regarding plan
   for disposition (home vs. rehab) and expectations for rehabilitation.
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - standing Atrovent nebs
   - start rehab screening, need to discuss with patient
   - d/c doxy today today
   - last day of Acyclovir 400mg TID today
   - Continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 18
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient significantly
   deconditioned and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve
   repair/replacement, it is unclear how much she will be able to
   rehabilitate from her current state. Physical therapy has begun working
   with her, but they are not able to provide the kind of intensive
   therapy that she would benefit from in a formal rehab facility.
   - start rehab screening, need to discuss with patient
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), slowly
   improving.  LOS fluid balance is approx 14L positive.  Patient
   diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting hypernatremia & elevated HCO3
   from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr.  Titrate to Goal UOP 100cc/hr, with
   goal I/O -500cc-1L today
   -  will need to transition to PO meds, likely tomorrow (torsemide for
   better oral bioavailability compared to lasix)
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # CARDIAC:
   PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   RHYTHM: Patient remains in AF.  Was on Amiodarone, discontinued
   yesterday since patient failed to convert on amiodarone. On Heparin gtt
   bridge to Coumadin. Continue Coumadin 2.5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will
   D/C Heparin gtt when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this admission.
   Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS without adverse side
   effects aside from residual somnolence this AM, but patient easily
   rousable.
   - Continue Mirtazapine 15mg qHS and Ativan 0.5mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr for now
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control & free water flushes increased.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Stable, at 11.4 today. Patient is afebrile, no sign of
   localized infection.  C. diff sent on [**12-22**] for diarrhea was negative.
   Central and A-Lines removed on [**12-23**]. CT scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated
   diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules, but has not been
   re-evaluated since clinical improvement.
   - d/c doxy today
   - last day of Acyclovir 400mg TID today
   - Trend daily CBC
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy
   .
   # Anemia of Inflammation:  Stable at 25.9. Normocytic, normochromic
   with normal RDW. B12 and folate normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Coumadin 2.5mg qHS (goal INR [**1-11**])
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction >60%) and a recent history of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was transferred to the ICU for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Her respiratory status improved after intubation, but she remains deconditioned and there is a significant risk of aspiration.

The patient has been in the hospital for 18 days and has been immobile due to intubation. She has significant anasarca (generalized swelling), which has contributed to her fluid overload. Her fluid balance is approximately 14 liters positive. She is diuresing on IV Lasix gtt, resulting in hypernatremia and elevated HCO3 due to contraction alkalosis.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, but she remains in atrial fibrillation. She has severe mitral regurgitation but refuses mitral valve repair/replacement surgery. Her coronary history is unremarkable. She will continue on Coumadin (goal INR 1.1) and ASA 81mg daily.

The patient has insomnia, which has improved with mirtazapine 15mg qHS. She also has metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, anemia of inflammation, and a possible old right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient
   tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  Overall,
   while O2 can be weaned somewhat, patient appears to be nearing a
   plateau in regard to respiratory progress. As patient has decided not
   to proceed with MVR surgery, discussion should be had regarding plan
   for disposition (home vs. rehab) and expectations for rehabilitation.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr.  Titrate to Goal UOP 100cc/hr, with
   goal I/O -1L today
   - continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - standing Atrovent nebs
   - start rehab screening, need to discuss with patient
   - d/c doxy today today
   - last day of Acyclovir 400mg TID today
   - Continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 18
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient significantly
   deconditioned and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve
   repair/replacement, it is unclear how much she will be able to
   rehabilitate from her current state. Physical therapy has begun working
   with her, but they are not able to provide the kind of intensive
   therapy that she would benefit from in a formal rehab facility.
   - start rehab screening, need to discuss with patient
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), slowly
   improving.  LOS fluid balance is approx 14L positive.  Patient
   diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting hypernatremia & elevated HCO3
   from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr.  Titrate to Goal UOP 100cc/hr, with
   goal I/O -1L today
   -  will need to transition to PO meds, likely tomorrow (torsemide for
   better oral bioavailability compared to lasix)
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # CARDIAC:
   PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   - continue diuresis as above
   RHYTHM: Patient remains in AF.  Was on Amiodarone, discontinued
   yesterday since patient failed to convert on amiodarone.
   - continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin.
   - Continue Coumadin 2.5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will D/C Heparin gtt
   when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   - start digoxin 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this admission.
   -Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping
   all day yesterday.
   - keep pt awake during the day
   - Continue Mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS and Ativan 0.5mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr for now
   - one dose of diamox today
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control & free water flushes increased.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   - decrease free water flushes to 150cc/6hr
   - re-consult nutrition re Na load in TF
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Stable, at 11.4 today. Patient is afebrile, no sign of
   localized infection.  C. diff sent on [**12-22**] for diarrhea was negative.
   Central and A-Lines removed on [**12-23**]. CT scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated
   diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules, but has not been
   re-evaluated since clinical improvement.
   - d/c doxy today
   - last day of Acyclovir 400mg TID today
   - Trend daily CBC
   - send another c.diff given diarrhea
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy
   .
   # Anemia of Inflammation:  Stable at 25.9. Normocytic, normochromic
   with normal RDW. B12 and folate normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # ? Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Coumadin 2.5mg qHS (goal INR [**1-11**])
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient
   tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  Overall,
   while O2 can be weaned somewhat, patient appears to be nearing a
   plateau in regard to respiratory progress. As patient has decided not
   to proceed with MVR surgery, discussion should be had regarding plan
   for disposition (home vs. rehab) and expectations for rehabilitation.
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - standing Atrovent nebs
   - start rehab screening, need to discuss with patient
   - d/c doxy today today
   - last day of Acyclovir 400mg TID today
   - Continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 18
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient significantly
   deconditioned and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve
   repair/replacement, it is unclear how much she will be able to
   rehabilitate from her current state. Physical therapy has begun working
   with her, but they are not able to provide the kind of intensive
   therapy that she would benefit from in a formal rehab facility.
   - start rehab screening, need to discuss with patient
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance (multifactorial:
   hypoalbuminemia/chronic sCHF/
leaky capillary syndrome
), slowly
   improving.  LOS fluid balance is approx 14L positive.  Patient
   diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting hypernatremia & elevated HCO3
   from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr.  Titrate to Goal UOP 100cc/hr, with
   goal I/O -500cc-1L today
   -  will need to transition to PO meds, likely tomorrow (torsemide for
   better oral bioavailability compared to lasix)
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # CARDIAC:
   PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   RHYTHM: Patient remains in AF.  Was on Amiodarone, discontinued
   yesterday since patient failed to convert on amiodarone. On Heparin gtt
   bridge to Coumadin. Continue Coumadin 2.5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will
   D/C Heparin gtt when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this admission.
   Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS without adverse side
   effects aside from residual somnolence this AM, but patient easily
   rousable.
   - Continue Mirtazapine 15mg qHS and Ativan 0.5mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr for now
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to less concentrated boost
   glucose control & free water flushes increased.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Stable, at 11.4 today. Patient is afebrile, no sign of
   localized infection.  C. diff sent on [**12-22**] for diarrhea was negative.
   Central and A-Lines removed on [**12-23**]. CT scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated
   diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules, but has not been
   re-evaluated since clinical improvement.
   - d/c doxy today
   - last day of Acyclovir 400mg TID today
   - Trend daily CBC
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy
   .
   # Anemia of Inflammation:  Stable at 25.9. Normocytic, normochromic
   with normal RDW. B12 and folate normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF) and recent respiratory distress. She has been in the ICU for 18 days, during which she was intubated and required pressors. The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status but remains deconditioned and has significant anasarca. She refuses mitral valve replacement surgery, which is necessary for her full recovery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still has a risk of aspiration due to difficulty clearing her airway. Oxygen saturation remains good, and she is tolerating weaning off oxygen.
2. Physical Deconditioning: Due to her prolonged immobility and significant anasarca, the patient is significantly deconditioned. She refuses surgery, making intensive therapy for rehabilitation uncertain.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has anasarca and chronic CHF, leading to fluid overload. She is currently diuresing with IV Lasix and will need to transition to oral medications soon. Close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is necessary.
4. Cardiac: The patient's cardiac function is stable with severe mitral regurgitation. She remains in atrial fibrillation and has refused mitral valve repair/replacement surgery.
5. Insomnia: The patient has improved on mirtazapine without adverse effects. She continues to take mirtazapine and ativan"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction >60%) and a history of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to the hospital for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been improving after intubation, requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock despite no positive cultures.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is improving from a respiratory standpoint but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway challenging and aspiration risk still significant. She is tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals. As the patient has decided not to proceed with mitral valve repair surgery, discussions have been started to transition her to rehab.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has anasarca and a positive fluid balance due to congestive heart failure. She is diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting hypernatremia and elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable. The goal is to continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1L today. She will need to transition to PO meds prior to discharge.

3. Rhythm: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation. She was on Amiodarone, which was discontinued"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient
   tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  As patient
   has decided not to proceed with MVR surgery, so discussion has been
   started to transition her to rehab.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr.  Goal I/O -1L today
   - continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PRN Atrovent nebs
   - d/c Acyclovir 400mg TID
   - Continue TF (boost glucose control)
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - continue rehab screening
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid imbalance CHF and overall
   positive fluid balance, slowly improving.  Patient diuresing on IV
   Lasix gtt with resulting hypernatremia & elevated HCO3 from contraction
   alkalosis that is stable.
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr, goal I/O -1L today
   -  will need to transition to PO meds, likely torsemide for better oral
   bioavailability compared to lasix
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient remains in AF.  Was on Amiodarone, which was
   discontinued since patient failed to convert on amiodarone.  Started on
   digoxin 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2129-12-24**].
   - continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin.
   - Continue Coumadin 2.5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will D/C Heparin gtt
   when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   - continue digoxin load at 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **], after 2mg is loaded, then will
   start 0.125mg daily
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.  s/p one dose of
   diamox yesterday.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr for now
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to Nutren 2.0 which has less Na.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   - continue free water flushes at 150cc/6hr
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping
   all day during the day after 15mg Mirtazapine.  Much better on
   Mirtazapine 7.5 plus 1mg IV ativan.
   - try to keep pt awake during the day
   - Continue Mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS and Ativan IV 1mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   - continue diuresis as above
   .
   # CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this
   admission.
   -Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 20days,
   intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility compounded
   by significant anasarca has left patient significantly deconditioned
   and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, it
   is unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current
   state. Physical therapy has been working with her, but they are not
   able to provide the kind of intensive therapy that she would benefit
   from in a formal rehab facility.
   - continue rehab screening
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Resolved. Down to 9.0 today. Patient is afebrile, no
   sign of localized infection.  Central and A-Lines removed on [**12-23**]. CT
   scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules, but has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.  C.
   diff sent on [**12-22**] and [**12-24**] were negative.
   - last day of Acyclovir 400mg TID today
   - Trend daily CBC
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy
   .
   # Anemia of Inflammation:  Hct stable. Normocytic, normochromic with
   normal RDW. B12 and folate normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Coumadin 2.5mg qHS (goal INR [**1-11**])
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction >60%) and recent onset of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was transferred to the hospital for heart failure and new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Her condition improved after intubation and the use of pressors, but she remains deconditioned and refuses mitral valve replacement surgery. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been there for 20 days, with a prolonged period of immobility compounded by significant anasarca.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still has a challenging airway clearance and aspiration risk due to her deconditioned state. Her RR remains in the mid-20s to upper 30s on 3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance and is slowly improving. She is diuresing on IV Lasix gtt, resulting in hypernatremia and elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable. She will need to transition to PO meds, likely torsemide for better oral bioavailability compared to Lasix.
3. Rhythm: The patient remains in AF. She was previously on amiodarone, which was discontinued since she failed to convert on amiodarone. She started on digoxin 0"

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction >60%) and recent worsening of her condition. She presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath, and was transferred to the ICU for further management of heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

During her stay in the ICU, the patient has shown significant improvement in her respiratory status, with decreased need for supplemental oxygen and extubation. However, she remains deconditioned and at risk for aspiration. She is tolerating lasix (furosemide) well and meeting fluid goals. The patient has decided against proceeding with mitral valve repair surgery, so discussions have been initiated to transition her to a rehabilitation program that accepts patients with doffing.

The patient's fluid overload is slowly improving, but she is experiencing hypernatremia and elevated bicarbonate levels due to contraction alkalosis. She is currently on digoxin and has been started on diamox (acetazolamide) to correct metabolic alkalosis. The patient's renal function is stable, and her BUN/Cr ratio is greater than 20. She is also being treated for insomnia with mirtazapine and ativan.

The patient has a history of leukocytosis, which has resolved, and she no longer requires antibiotics. Her anemia is likely due to inflammation, and her right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory status and suspected septic shock. She has been intubated and required pressors for hemodynamic support. The patient has made significant improvements in her respiratory status and is now extubated. However, she remains deconditioned and at risk for aspiration. She is refusing mitral valve repair/replacement surgery, which is necessary for her full recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, which can contribute to pulmonary congestion and respiratory distress. She also has bibasilar crackles on pulmonary examination, indicating possible fluid in the lungs. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygen saturation is essential.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has anasarca (generalized edema) and a positive fluid balance, indicating fluid overload. Diuresis with IV Lasix has been initiated to manage this condition. Regular monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent further fluid overload.

3. Pump/Severe MR: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation (MR), which may contribute to her pulmonary status. Mitral valve repair/replacement surgery is necessary for her long-term management. However, the patient is refusing surgery, and it is unclear how much her current condition is due to MR versus fluid resuscitation.

4. Rhythm: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation (AF). Digoxin has been started to control the heart rate, and anticoagulation with heparin and Coumadin is being continued to prevent thromboembolic events.

5. Coronaries: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease. Aspirin is being continued for its antiplatelet effects.

6. Physical Deconditioning: The patient has been immobilized for an extended period due to her hospitalization and intubation. She is significantly deconditioned and may benefit from rehabilitation services. Physical therapy and occupational therapy are being continued to help improve her functional status.

7. Insomnia: The patient has been experiencing sleep disturbances. Mirtazapine and IV lorazepam have been used to promote sleep. Efforts should be made to keep the patient awake during the day.

8. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly secondary to diuretic use and contraction alkalosis. Regular monitoring of electrolytes is necessary to adjust diuretic therapy as needed.

9. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to TF and diuretic use. Free water flushes are being given, and Lasix dosage may need to be adjusted based on electrolyte trends.

10. Leukocytosis: The patient had leukocytosis, which has now resolved. Close monitoring of white blood cell counts is essential to"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3-5L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation.
   Patient tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  As
   patient has decided not to proceed with MVR surgery, so discussion has
   been started to transition her to rehab. On no abx as of [**12-25**]
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr.  Goal I/O -1L today
   - continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PRN Atrovent nebs
   - Continue TF with rate adjustment for symptoms
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - continue rehab screening, will need a rehab that takes pts with
   dobhoff
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD, Hypernatremia, Elevated HCO3: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid
   imbalance CHF and overall positive fluid balance, slowly improving.
   Patient diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting hypernatremia &
   elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   - renal curbside
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr, goal I/O -1L today
   -  will need to transition to PO meds prior to discharge
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient developed new AF this admission but has been in sinus
   rhythm for roughly 24 hours.  Was on Amiodarone, which was discontinued
   since patient failed to convert on amiodarone.  Started on digoxin
   0.25mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2129-12-24**], now on 0.125 mg
   - continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin.
   - increase Coumadin to 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will D/C Heparin gtt
   when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   - continue digoxin load at 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **], after 2mg is loaded, then will
   start 0.125mg daily
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 20days,
   intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility compounded
   by significant anasarca has left patient significantly deconditioned
   and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, it
   is unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current
   state. Physical therapy has been working with her, but they are not
   able to provide the kind of intensive therapy that she would benefit
   from in a formal rehab facility.
   - continue rehab screening, will need a rehab that accepts pts with
   dobhoff
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   - prevent contractures with PT and boot placement
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.  s/p two doses of
   diamox over  the last two days.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr for now
   - diamox 250mg daily, last day today
   - aldactone 25mg daily
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to Nutren 2.0 which has less Na.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   - continue free water flushes at 150cc/6hr
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping
   all day during the day after 15mg Mirtazapine.  Much better on
   Mirtazapine 7.5 plus 1mg IV ativan.
   - try to keep pt awake during the day
   - Continue Mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS and Ativan IV 1mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   - continue diuresis as above
   - start aldactone 25mg daily
   .
   # CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this
   admission.
   -Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Resolved. Down to 9.0 today. Patient is afebrile, no
   sign of localized infection.  Central and A-Lines removed on [**12-23**]. CT
   scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules, but has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.  C.
   diff sent on [**12-22**] and [**12-24**] were negative. off all abx today on [**12-25**]
   - Trend daily CBC
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy
   .
   # Anemia of Inflammation:  Hct stable. Normocytic, normochromic with
   normal RDW. B12 and folate normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - increase Coumadin to 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**])
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye drops
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and a recent admission for heart failure exacerbation and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been improving and is now extubated, tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr, and weaning off oxygen. The patient has decided against mitral valve surgery. 

The patient's current concerns include respiratory distress, fluid overload, hypernatremia, rhythm disturbance, physical deconditioning, metabolic alkalosis, insomnia, severe mitral regurgitation, leukocytosis, anemia of inflammation, right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, glaucoma, and hypothyroidism. 

The plan includes continuing Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr, weaning off oxygen, keeping the head of bed elevated, transitioning to chair, using Atrovent nebs as needed, adjusting tube feeding rate for symptoms, monitoring ABGs and respiratory status, and discussing rehabilitation options. 

The patient is stable with controlled fluid overload and hypernatremia. She is in sinus rhythm for approximately 24 hours and will continue digoxin at 0.125mg daily. Physical therapy and occupational therapy are being continued to address deconditioning. Metabolic alkalosis is stable, and electrolytes are being closely monitored. The patient's insomnia is improved with Mirtazapine 7.5mg q"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway
   challenging and aspiration risk still significant. RR remains in mid
   20
s to upper 30
s on 3-5L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation.
   Patient tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals.  As
   patient has decided not to proceed with MVR surgery, so discussion has
   been started to transition her to rehab. On no abx as of [**12-25**]
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr.  Goal I/O -1L today
   - continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PRN Atrovent nebs
   - Continue TF with rate adjustment for symptoms
   - follow ABGs and respiratory status
   - continue rehab screening, will need a rehab that takes pts with
   dobhoff
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD, Hypernatremia, Elevated HCO3: Anasarca [**1-10**] fluid
   imbalance CHF and overall positive fluid balance, slowly improving.
   Patient diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting hypernatremia &
   elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   - renal curbside
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr, goal I/O -1L today
   -  will need to transition to PO meds prior to discharge
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient developed new AF this admission but has been in sinus
   rhythm for roughly 24 hours.  Was on Amiodarone, which was discontinued
   since patient failed to convert on amiodarone.  Started on digoxin
   0.25mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2129-12-24**], now on 0.125 mg
   - continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin.
   - increase Coumadin to 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will D/C Heparin gtt
   when at goal. INR today 1.1.
   - continue digoxin load at 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **], after 2mg is loaded, then will
   start 0.125mg daily
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 20days,
   intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility compounded
   by significant anasarca has left patient significantly deconditioned
   and as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, it
   is unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current
   state. Physical therapy has been working with her, but they are not
   able to provide the kind of intensive therapy that she would benefit
   from in a formal rehab facility.
   - continue rehab screening, will need a rehab that accepts pts with
   dobhoff
   - continue PT/OT
   - encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   - prevent contractures with PT and boot placement
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.  s/p two doses of
   diamox over  the last two days.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr for now
   - diamox 250mg daily, last day today
   - aldactone 25mg daily
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Stable.  TF changed to Nutren 2.0 which has less Na.
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   - continue free water flushes at 150cc/6hr
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping
   all day during the day after 15mg Mirtazapine.  Much better on
   Mirtazapine 7.5 plus 1mg IV ativan.
   - try to keep pt awake during the day
   - Continue Mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS and Ativan IV 1mg qHS:PRN
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   - continue diuresis as above
   - start aldactone 25mg daily
   .
   # CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this
   admission.
   -Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Resolved. Down to 9.0 today. Patient is afebrile, no
   sign of localized infection.  Central and A-Lines removed on [**12-23**]. CT
   scan from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary
   nodules, but has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.  C.
   diff sent on [**12-22**] and [**12-24**] were negative. off all abx today on [**12-25**]
   - Trend daily CBC
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy

   # Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - increase Coumadin to 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**])

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (EF >60%) and recent admission for heart failure, new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was intubated and required pressors, showing signs of improvement but still has significant deconditioning and risk of aspiration. She is currently on multiple medications including acetazolamide, digoxin, spironolactone, Lasix, heparin, and Coumadin. Her labs show some abnormalities such as leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and metabolic alkalosis. She also has anemia of chronic inflammation and evidence of an old right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is at risk for respiratory distress due to her history of heart failure, deconditioning, and potential aspiration.
2. Fluid Overload: Despite diuresis, the patient may continue to experience fluid overload, leading to further complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's elevated bicarbonate levels indicate metabolic alkalosis, which can affect various bodily functions.
5. Anemia of Chronic Inflammation: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic heart failure (EF >60%) who was admitted to the hospital for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been improving after intubation and the use of pressors. However, she is refusing mitral valve repair surgery, which is needed for her full recovery.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory distress: The patient is improving but remains deconditioned, making clearing her airway challenging and aspiration risk still significant. She is tolerating Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr well, meeting fluid goals. The goal is to continue weaning O2 as tolerated, keep the head of bed elevated, out of bed to chair, and continue with rehab screening.
- Fluid overload, hypernatremia, elevated HCO3: The patient has a positive fluid balance due to CHF and is slowly improving. She is diuresing on IV Lasix gtt, resulting in hypernatremia and elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable. The goal is to continue Lasix gtt at 5-10mg/hr, transition to PO meds prior to discharge, and closely monitor electrolytes and renal function.

   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned. RR remains in mid 20
s on 2-3L O2 by
   NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient tolerating diuresis well and
   meeting fluid goals.  As patient has decided not to proceed with MVR
   surgery, screening has begun to transition her to rehab.
   - Convert Lasix to PO at fixed dosing in anticipation of discharge.
   Begin at 80mg PO BID.  Goal I/O -1L today.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - Keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PRN Atrovent nebs
   - Continue TF
   - Follow ABGs and respiratory status
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD w/ elevated HCO3: Patient with edema [**1-10**] fluid

   when at goal. INR today 1.4.
   - Continue Digoxin load at 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **] to 8 doses (2g total) will start
   0.125mg daily tomorrow
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 22
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient deconditioned and
   as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, it is
   unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current
   state.
   - Continue rehab screening, will need a rehab that accepts pts with
   Dobhoff unless patient passes S&S evaluation
   - Continue PT/OT
   - Multipodus boots in place
   - Encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - Continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic heart failure and a history of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to the hospital for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. After intubation and pressor support, her respiratory status improved, but she remains deconditioned. The patient has decided not to proceed with mitral valve surgery, which is necessary for her full recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient still experiences respiratory distress, as indicated by her mid-20s respiratory rate on 2-3L O2 by nasal cannula. She tolerates diuresis well and meets fluid goals. It is crucial to continue weaning O2 as tolerated, keep the head of bed elevated, and encourage regular limb movement in bed.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload with edema and elevated HCO3 levels. Diuresis with IV Lasix has been initiated, resulting in contraction alkalosis. Close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is necessary. The goal is to convert Lasix to PO at fixed dosing in anticipation of discharge.

3. Rhythm: The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation during her admission but has converted to sinus rhythm on Digoxin. Heparin gtt will be bridged to Coumadin, and the INR should be maintained between 2-11"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned. RR remains in mid 20
s on 2-3L O2 by
   NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient tolerating diuresis well and
   meeting fluid goals.  As patient has decided not to proceed with MVR
   surgery, screening has begun to transition her to rehab.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 2.5-5mg/hr.  Goal I/O -1L today
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - Keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PRN Atrovent nebs
   - Continue TF
   - Follow ABGs and respiratory status
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD w/ elevated HCO3: Patient with edema [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation & MR, slowly improving.  Diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with
   resulting elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   Hypernatremia markedly improved with increased free water flushes.
   -  Continue Lasix gtt at 2.5-5mg/hr, goal I/O -1L today
   -  Give second dose of Metolazone 5mg PO x 1, with close observation of
   HCO3 as patient demonstrating adequate respiratory compensation
   -  will transition to PO meds prior to discharge
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   -  MAP goal is 60-65
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient developed new AF this admission but has converted to
   sinus rhythm on Digoxin (started [**12-24**]) after failing Amiodarone trial.
   - Continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin.
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will D/C Heparin gtt
   when at goal. INR today 1.4.
   - Continue Digoxin load at 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **] to 8 doses (2g total) will start
   0.125mg daily tomorrow
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 22
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient deconditioned and
   as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, it is
   unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current
   state.
   - Continue rehab screening, will need a rehab that accepts pts with
   Dobhoff unless patient passes S&S evaluation
   - Continue PT/OT
   - Multipodus boots in place
   - Encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - Continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   - Repeat S&S evaluation
   .
   # METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and contraction
   alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.  Completed 3 day
   course of Diamox.
   - Continue Lasix gtt at 2.5-5.0mg/hr
   - Give a second dose of Metolazone 5mg PO x 1
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg PO daily
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Improved with increased free water flushes following
   TF
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN
   - Continue free water flushes at 250cc/6hr
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping
   all day during the day after 15mg Mirtazapine.  Blood pressures dropped
   briefly overnight with IV Ativan for sleep.
   - Try to keep patient awake during the day
   - Continue Mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS and conservative use of Ativan IV
   qHS:PRN
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   - Continue Lasix gtt diuresis as above
   - Continue Spironolactone PO 25mg daily
   .
   # CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this
   admission.
   - Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Resolved. Completed all courses of antibiotics. CT scan
   from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules, but
   has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.  C. diff sent on
   [**12-22**] and [**12-24**] were negative.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy
   .
   # Anemia of Inflammation:  Hct stable. Normocytic, normochromic with
   normal RDW. B12 and folate normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Coumadin to 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**])
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye gtts
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic heart failure and a history of generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was admitted to the hospital for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been improving after intubation, requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, which is concerning for septic shock despite no positive cultures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory distress: The patient is improving from a respiratory standpoint, but remains deconditioned. Her respiratory rate is in the mid-20s on 2-3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation.
- Fluid overload with elevated HCO3: The patient has edema and is undergoing fluid resuscitation and medical management for congestive heart failure. She is diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with resulting elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
- Rhythm: The patient developed new AF this admission but has converted to sinus rhythm on Digoxin (started 12-24) after failing Amiodarone trial. She will continue on Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin and continue Coumadin at 5mg daily (goal INR 1.1-2.0). Her INR today is 1.4.
- Physical deconditioning: The patient has been in the hospital for 22 days, intubated from 12-17. Her extended period of immobility compounded by significant anasarca has left her deconditioned. She is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, so it is unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current state.
- Metabolic alkalosis: Stable, Lasix diuresis and contraction alkalosis. BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable. Completed 3-day course of Diamox.
- Hypernatremia: Improved with increased free water flushes following TF. Continue to trend with Hospital1 electrolytes & adjust Lasix gtt PRN.
- Insomnia: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping all day during the day after 15mg Mirtazapine. Blood pressures dropped briefly overnight with IV Ativan for sleep.
- Pump/severe MR: Stable per TTE on 12-16, patient refusing MVR. Likely contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [1-10] fluid resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction >60%) who has been admitted to the ICU for worsening heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's recent medical history includes generalized weakness, shortness of breath, and refusal of mitral valve repair surgery.

The patient's current condition is improving, with stable vital signs, good oxygen saturation, and tolerating diuresis well. The goals for the patient's care include converting Lasix to oral dosing in anticipation of discharge, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, keeping the head of bed elevated, out-of-bed chair activities, using Atrovent nebs as needed, continuing tube feeding, and following arterial blood gas (ABG) results and respiratory status.

The patient has a history of fluid overload with elevated bicarbonate levels, which have improved with diuresis and increased free water flushes. The patient also has hypernatremia, which has improved with increased free water flushes.

Regarding the patient's rhythm, she developed new-onset atrial fibrillation during her admission but has converted to sinus rhythm on digoxin. The plan is to continue heparin therapy as a bridge to Coumadin, with a goal INR of 1.4-2.8. Digoxin will be continued at a daily dose of 0.125 mg.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and recent admission for heart failure exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and refusal of mitral valve surgery. She has been in the hospital for 22 days, intubated from December 17th, and has shown improvement in her respiratory status but remains deconditioned. The patient is currently on diuretics, digoxin, and anticoagulation therapy. She has multiple medical complications including fluid overload, hypernatremia, insomnia, leukocytosis, anemia of inflammation, right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, glaucoma, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid Overload: The patient has edema and is currently undergoing diuresis with Lasix to manage fluid overload. Close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is necessary.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Free water flushes have been increased to address this issue.
3. Insomnia: The patient has difficulty sleeping and has been prescribed Mirtazapine for insomnia. Conservative use of Ativan IV qHS:PRN is also being considered.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count, but it has resolved after completing antibiotic courses. Regular monitoring of CBC is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, an elderly woman, is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She has a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/25 to 91/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient received one dose of Metolazone and continued on 0.25 of Digoxin. Renal recommendations were made to increase free water flushes to 250cc every 6 hours. The patient felt uncomfortable but improved after returning to bed.

Vital signs monitoring showed a slight drop in systolic blood pressure to the 70s after receiving Ativan for sleep. Lasix drip was held briefly and then restarted at a lower rate. The patient's urine output decreased but was restarted on 2.5 Lasix and reached 200/hr.

The patient has allergies to hydrochlorothiazide and experienced a rash. She completed a course of antibiotics (Acyclovir) until December 29th, 08:30 AM.

Infusions include Furosemide (Lasix) at 2.5 mg/hour and Heparin Sodium at 850 units/hour. Other medications include Lorazepam (Ativan) since December 27th, 12:00 AM.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Flow sheet data shows fluctuating fluid balance with a net negative 3.2 liters since December 31st at 31 AM. The patient's weight has decreased from 74.4 kg at admission to 76.8 kg currently.

Physical examination revealed an elderly woman lying in bed, sleeping, with no abnormalities noted in the general, cardio, pulmon, abdominal, extremities, or peripheral vascular assessments. Neurologic examination showed the patient to be alert and oriented, moving all extremities, and conversant.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Other lab values, including electrolytes and kidney function tests, are also within normal limits.

The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.47, pCO2 of 63, pO2 of 35, HCO3 of 47, and base excess of 18. The patient has been receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with SpO2 consistently at 100%.

The patient's medical and family history, review of systems, and physical examination are unchanged from previous notes. The patient's disposition is pending rehab placement and SS evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance has shown a net negative 3.2 liters, indicating fluid removal through diuretics. However"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   FOR [**12-28**]
    Pt to leave for rehab at 10 am. Was stable overnight; received dobhoff
   on [**12-27**]
   .
   PLAN IN GENERAL
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned. RR remains in mid 20
s on 2-3L O2 by
   NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient tolerating diuresis well and
   meeting fluid goals.  As patient has decided not to proceed with MVR
   surgery, patient to proceed with rehab and optimal medical therapy
   - PO lasix
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - Keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PRN Atrovent nebs
   - Continue TF
   - Follow ABGs and respiratory status, prn
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD w/ elevated HCO3: Patient with edema [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation & MR, slowly improving.  Diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with
   resulting elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   Hypernatremia markedly improved with increased free water flushes.
   -  lasix, aldactone, metolazone
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient developed new AF this admission but has converted to
   sinus rhythm on Digoxin (started [**12-24**]) after failing Amiodarone trial.
   - Continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin.
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will D/C Heparin gtt
   when at goal. INR today 1.9.
   - dig 0.125mg daily
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 22
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient deconditioned and
   as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, it is
   unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current
   state.
   - Continue PT/OT
   - Multipodus boots in place to prevent contracture
   - Encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - Continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   - Repeat S&S evaluation prn
   .
   # Hyperbicarbia without alkalosis: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and
   contraction alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.
   Completed 3 day course of Diamox.
   - lasix, metolazone
   - Give a second dose of Metolazone 5mg PO x 1
   - Increase Spironolactone 25mg PO to [**Hospital1 **]
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Improved with increased free water flushes following
   TF
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix PRN
   - Continue free water flushes at 250cc/6hr
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping
   all day during the day after 15mg Mirtazapine.  Blood pressures dropped
   briefly overnight with IV Ativan for sleep.
   - Try to keep patient awake during the day
   - Continue Mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS and conservative use of Ativan IV
   qHS:PRN
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   - Continue Lasix diuresis as above

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction >60%) and recent exacerbation of heart failure, who was intubated and received pressors for marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic shock. She was extubated on [**12-17**] and her respiratory status has been improving. The patient has been in the hospital for 22 days and is deconditioned due to extended immobility and significant anasarca. She is refusing mitral valve repair/replacement surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status may continue to improve, but she remains deconditioned and at risk for further respiratory distress.
2. Fluid overload: The patient had edema and fluid resuscitation, but is slowly improving with diuresis. Close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is necessary.
3. Rhythm disturbances: The patient developed new atrial fibrillation (AF) during her admission, but converted to sinus rhythm on digoxin. She should continue with Heparin bridge to Coumadin and maintain an INR between 2-3.
4. Physical deconditioning: The patient's extended period of immobility, compounded by significant anasarca, has left her deconditioned. Physical therapy and occupational therapy should be continued to aid in rehabilitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y.o woman with chronic sCHF (EF >60%) with 2 week history of
   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.
   FOR [**12-28**]
    Pt to leave for rehab at 10 am. Was stable overnight; received dobhoff
   on [**12-27**]
   .
   PLAN IN GENERAL
   # RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient is improving from respiratory stand
   point, but remains deconditioned. RR remains in mid 20
s on 2-3L O2 by
   NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient tolerating diuresis well and
   meeting fluid goals.  As patient has decided not to proceed with MVR
   surgery, patient to proceed with rehab and optimal medical therapy
   - PO lasix
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - Keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PRN Atrovent nebs
   - Continue TF
   - Follow ABGs and respiratory status, prn
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD w/ elevated HCO3: Patient with edema [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation & MR, slowly improving.  Diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with
   resulting elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   Hypernatremia markedly improved with increased free water flushes.
   -  lasix, aldactone, metolazone
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient developed new AF this admission but has converted to
   sinus rhythm on Digoxin (started [**12-24**]) after failing Amiodarone trial.
   - Continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin.
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will D/C Heparin gtt
   when at goal. INR today 1.9.
   - dig 0.125mg daily
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 22
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient deconditioned and
   as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, it is
   unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current
   state.
   - Continue PT/OT
   - Multipodus boots in place to prevent contracture
   - Encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - Continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   - Repeat S&S evaluation prn
   .
   # Hyperbicarbia without alkalosis: Stable. [**1-10**] Lasix diuresis and
   contraction alkalosis.  BUN/Cr ratio > 20. Creatinine stable.
   Completed 3 day course of Diamox.
   - lasix, metolazone
   - Give a second dose of Metolazone 5mg PO x 1
   - Increase Spironolactone 25mg PO to [**Hospital1 **]
   - PM electrolytes
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Improved with increased free water flushes following
   TF
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix PRN
   - Continue free water flushes at 250cc/6hr
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping
   all day during the day after 15mg Mirtazapine.  Blood pressures dropped
   briefly overnight with IV Ativan for sleep.
   - Try to keep patient awake during the day
   - Continue Mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS and conservative use of Ativan IV
   qHS:PRN
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   - Continue Lasix diuresis as above
   - Increase Spironolactone PO 25mg to [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this
   admission.
   - Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Resolved. Completed all courses of antibiotics. CT scan
   from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules, but
   has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.  C. diff sent on
   [**12-22**] and [**12-24**] were negative.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy
   .
   # Anemia of Inflammation:  Hct stable. Normocytic, normochromic with
   normal RDW. B12 and folate normal. Guaiac positive stools.
   - Continue to trend with daily CBC
   .
   # Right LE DVT: Patient was found to have a possible old DVT in the
   right posterior tibial veins (normal compression, but no appearance of
   flow) on LENI
s performed on [**12-8**].
   - Continue Heparin gtt as bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Coumadin to 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**])
   .
   # Glaucoma:
   - Continue home eye gtts
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.
   - Continue home Levothyroxine

   generalized weakness and shortness of breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for
   heart failure and new afib with RVR, now improving after intubation
   requiring pressors and a marked leukocytosis, concerning for septic
   shock despite no positive cultures. Patient was extubated on [**12-17**],
   respiratory status improving, but refusing MVR surgery needed for full
   recovery.

   point, but remains deconditioned. RR remains in mid 20
s on 2-3L O2 by
   NC with good oxygen saturation. Patient tolerating diuresis well and
   meeting fluid goals.  As patient has decided not to proceed with MVR
   surgery, patient to proceed with rehab and optimal medical therapy
   - PO lasix
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - Keep HOB elevated
   - Out of bed to chair
   - PRN Atrovent nebs
   - Continue TF
   - Follow ABGs and respiratory status, prn
   .
   #. FLUID OVERLOAD w/ elevated HCO3: Patient with edema [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation & MR, slowly improving.  Diuresing on IV Lasix gtt with
   resulting elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable.
   Hypernatremia markedly improved with increased free water flushes.
   -  lasix, aldactone, metolazone
   -  Closely monitor electrolytes and renal function
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient developed new AF this admission but has converted to
   sinus rhythm on Digoxin (started [**12-24**]) after failing Amiodarone trial.
   - Continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin.
   - Continue Coumadin at 5mg daily (goal INR [**1-11**]). Will D/C Heparin gtt
   when at goal. INR today 1.9.
   - dig 0.125mg daily
   .
   # PHYSICAL DECONDITIONING: Patient has been in the hospital for 22
   days, intubated from [**Date range (1) 10393**].  Her extended period of immobility
   compounded by significant anasarca has left patient deconditioned and
   as she is refusing surgery for mitral valve repair/replacement, it is
   unclear how much she will be able to rehabilitate from her current
   state.
   - Continue PT/OT
   - Multipodus boots in place to prevent contracture
   - Encourage regular limb movement in bed
   - Continue TF to gain nutrition and strength back
   - Repeat S&S evaluation prn

   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Improved with increased free water flushes following
   TF
   - Continue to trend with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes & adjust Lasix PRN
   - Continue free water flushes at 250cc/6hr
   .
   # INSOMNIA: Improved on Mirtazapine 15mg qHS but patient was sleeping
   all day during the day after 15mg Mirtazapine.  Blood pressures dropped
   briefly overnight with IV Ativan for sleep.
   - Try to keep patient awake during the day
   - Continue Mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS and conservative use of Ativan IV
   qHS:PRN
   .
   # PUMP/SEVERE MR: Stable per TTE on [**12-16**], patient refusing MVR. Likely
   contributing to pulmonary status, but unclear how much is [**1-10**] fluid
   resuscitation and what is from mitral regurgitation at present.
   - Continue Lasix diuresis as above
   - Increase Spironolactone PO 25mg to [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # CORONARIES: No coronary history. Not an active issue on this
   admission.
   - Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Resolved. Completed all courses of antibiotics. CT scan
   from [**12-9**] demonstrated diffuse lymphadenopathy & pulmonary nodules, but
   has not been re-evaluated since clinical improvement.  C. diff sent on
   [**12-22**] and [**12-24**] were negative.
   - Trend daily CBC
   - will need outpatient repeat CT scan in 2 months to assess resolution
   of lymphadenopathy

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction >60%) who presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She was initially transferred to another hospital for heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient improved after intubation and required pressors, suggesting a possible septic shock, although no positive cultures were found. She was extubated on December 17th and her respiratory status has been improving. However, she is refusing mitral valve surgery which is necessary for her full recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains deconditioned and her respiratory rate is in the mid-20s on 2-3L O2 by NC with good oxygen saturation. She tolerates diuresis well and meets fluid goals. She should continue to wean off O2 as tolerated, keep her head of bed elevated, and be out of bed to chair.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient had edema and fluid resuscitation & MR, but is slowly improving. She is being diuresed on IV Lasix and has an elevated HCO3 from contraction alkalosis that is stable. Her hypernatremia has markedly improved with increased free water flushes.

3. Rhythm: The patient developed new AF this admission but has converted to sinus rhythm on Digoxin after failing Amiodarone trial. She should continue"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and recent acute decompensation leading to hospitalization. She has been in the hospital for 22 days, intubated for respiratory distress due to heart failure and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is now improving and has been extubated. She is being transferred to a rehabilitation facility, refusing mitral valve repair surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she remains deconditioned with a mid-20s respiratory rate on 2-3L oxygen by nasal cannula. Continuous monitoring of ABGs and respiratory status is necessary.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has edema and elevated HCO3 levels due to contraction alkalosis from diuresis. Close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is required.
3. Rhythm: The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation this admission but has converted to sinus rhythm on digoxin. Continue Heparin gtt bridge to Coumadin, continue Coumadin at 5mg daily (goal INR 1.9-2.3), and D/C Heparin gtt when at goal.
4. Physical Deconditioning: The patient has been immobile for an extended period, and her significant anasarca has left her deconditioned. Continue PT/OT, multip"
