   Summary for morning rounds:
   39 year old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic
   syndrome and recurrent urinary tract infections transferred for
   assessment of altered mental status.  Recent Klebsiella UTI treated
   with ertapenem and cipro at [**Location (un) 78**]. Returns to [**Location (un) 78**]  with fatigue,
   low temps, and mild cough and congestion.  Initial vitals were notable
   for a temperature of 92.7.  Initial urinalysis was positive and he was
   started on ertapenem for presumed urinary tract infection.  Subsequent
   culture has been negative.  He had a head CT which showed possible
   blood in the third ventricle.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
   On arrival to our emergency room his initial vs were: T 96.2 P: 61 BP:
   120/71 R: 14 O2 sat 96%RA. Seen by neurosurgery who recommended only
   platelets at this time.
   On admission the patient alert and oriented x 3 but more lethargic than
   usual.  Decreased strength in UE.  Witnessed tonic-clonic seizure X2
   while on floor with subsequent hypoxia.  PNA on CXR on admission, but
   also possible aspiration during event. T max on the floor has been
   100.8  and he was continued on meropenem out of concern for UTI.  He
   had an EEG which showed left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing.
   Patient altered on arrival to MICU.  Tracks, orients to voice. No
   purposeful answers to questions.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 39 year old male with a history of C5
   quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome and recurrent urinary tract
   infections initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness
   now transferred to the MICU after two generalized tonic clonic seizures
   on the floor with associated hypoxia and worsening mental status.
   #Seizures/AMS:  Patient now with two generalized tonic clonic seizures
   since admission on [**2169-10-14**] after being seizure free since [**2169-2-22**].
   His last tonic clonic seizure was in [**2162**]. Per notes he was taking
   Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] at the time of admission. Most concerning etiology
   of increased seizure frequency would be infection.  Although there was
   initially concern for intraventricular hemorrhage on repeat CT scan
   this was more consistent with calcification.  He has had a recent
   urinary tract infection for which he received a 7 day course of
   appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Urine culture on admission was
   negative.  Blood cultures have been negative. He has evidence of
   multifocal pneumonia on CXR. Sputum cultures have been contaminated.
   EEG is concerning for temporal slowing concerning for epileptiform
   activity.  Per neurology they would recommend dilantin loading now with
   levels checked 1 hour post-loading for goal level 15.  He will need to
   be intubated for airway protection as well as for MRI scanning and
   lumbar puncture.  Looking at patient's antibiotic regimen, meropenem is
   highly associated with decreasing seizure threshold and would ideally
   discontinue this medication.  DFA negative.  IR performed LP which
   looks non-infectious.
   - continue infectious workup with repeat sputum cultures, blood, urine,
   repeat CXR, stool for c. diff
   - dilantin levels 1 hour post-loading with goal of 15 were low; Need
   neuro/pharm recs on next dose.
   - dilantin 100 mg IV Q8H; change in dosing according to neuro
   - will continue keppra 1000 mg IV BID
   - will plan to obtain MRI scan when clinically stable
   - vancomycin and aztreonam at meningitis dosing for coverage of
   hospital acquired pneumonia and bacterial meningitis
   .
   #Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  Patient with evidence of multifocal pneumonia on
   admission XRAY with increased secretions. Initially he was hypothermic,
   then low grade fevers, now hypothermic again.  Most likely due to
   hospital acquired pneumonia. Obstructive sleep apnea is also likely
   contributing to hypoxia as patient with episodes of apnea and hypoxia
   when lying flat.
   - vancomycin, aztreonam for coverage of hospital acquired pneumonia
   - DFA negative, tamiflu can be stopped.
   - will attempt to get better sputum sample and not double cover for
   pseudomonas at this time given concerns for ciprofloxacin reducing
   seizure threshold and renal dysfunction making aminoglycosides less
   optimal
   - will electively intubate given evidence that patient is protecting
   his airway and instability for MRI/LP
   .
   #Bradycardia: Patient states that he feels light-headed, but does not
   complain of chest pain or shortness of breath through event.  He had a
   temp of 95.6 and was warmed with bear hugger.  Had an EKG which showed
   sinus brady with lateral STD which are old.  Electrolytes, coags,
   cardiac enzymes were drawn.  Cardiac enzymes were elevated, but this
   seems to be his baseline.  Records of EKG
s and d/c summaries show that
   he has these events and cardiology has been consulted in the past.  No
   invasive measures were taken.
   - consult cardiology when patient improves
   - continue to keep warm and monitor labs
   - atropine to bedside
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Patient found to have trop of 0.25 when having
   bradycardic event.  According to records, this seems to be his
   baseline.  Could be related to renal dysfunction.  Has had cardiology
   consulted in the past and no interventions were recommended.
   Regardless, repeated test this am (0.22), ASA given, EKG repeated
   - repeat CE at 10am, with EKG
   - daily ASA dose starting tomorrow
   - cardiology consult
   .
   #C5 spinal cord injury:
   - will discuss baclofen pump with pain service today, may need to be
   restarted.
   .
   #Chronic Kidney Disease:  Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.7.  Currently at
   1.8 with elevated BUN.  History of chronic obstruction.
   - gentle hydration
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Could be due to dehydration in the setting of sepsis
   - D5W boluses today; 500 ml q 4 hours
   .
   #? hemorrhage on CT scan:  On repeat CT scan here, area of concern
   appeared more consistent with calcification.
   - will better define on MRI scan
   .
   #Myelodysplastic Syndrome:  Currently blood counts are within his
   baseline.
   - trend blood counts
   .

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He was initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness and later transferred to the MICU due to two generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the floor, associated hypoxia, and worsening mental status.

The patient has a recent Klebsiella UTI treated with ertapenem and ciprofloxacin, but subsequent urine culture was negative. He also has evidence of multifocal pneumonia on chest X-ray, and sputum cultures have been contaminated. Blood cultures have been negative. The patient's EEG showed left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing, which is concerning for epileptiform activity.

The patient's current medications include propofol, dilantin, and Kendra. He is intubated for airway protection and for an upcoming MRI scan and lumbar puncture. The plan is to continue infectious workup with repeat sputum cultures, blood, urine, repeat chest X-ray, stool for C. diff, and obtain an MRI scan when clinically stable.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 50 bpm (Sinus Bradycardia), blood pressure of 117/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% Fi"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 39 year old male with a history of C5
   quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome and recurrent urinary tract
   infections initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness
   now transferred to the MICU after two generalized tonic clonic seizures
   on the floor with associated hypoxia and worsening mental status.
   #Seizures/AMS:  Patient now with two generalized tonic-clonic seizures
   since admission on [**2169-10-14**] after being seizure free since [**2169-2-22**].
   His last tonic-clonic seizure was in [**2162**]. Per notes he was taking
   Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] at the time of admission. Most concerning etiology
   of increased seizure frequency would be infection.  Although there was
   initially concern for intraventricular hemorrhage on repeat CT scan
   this was more consistent with calcification. He has had a recent
   urinary tract infection for which he received a 7-day course of
   appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Urine culture on admission was
   negative.  Blood cultures have been negative. He has evidence of
   multifocal pneumonia on CXR. Sputum cultures have been contaminated.
   EEG is concerning for temporal slowing concerning for epileptiform
   activity.  Per neurology they would recommend dilantin loading now with
   levels checked 1 hour post-loading for goal level 15.  He will need to
   be intubated for airway protection as well as for MRI scanning and
   lumbar puncture.  Looking at patient's antibiotic regimen, meropenem is
   highly associated with decreasing seizure threshold and would ideally
   discontinue this medication.  DFA negative.  IR performed LP which
   looks non-infectious.
   - continue infectious workup with repeat sputum cultures, blood, urine,
   repeat CXR, stool for c. diff
   - dilantin levels 1 hour post-loading with goal of 15 were low; need
   neuro/pharm recs on next dose
   - dilantin 100 mg IV Q8H; change in dosing according to neuron; level
   was low, so need to adjust dosing
   - will continue keppra 1000 mg IV BID
   - f/u MRI from this morning
   - vancomycin and aztreonam at meningitis dosing for coverage of
   hospital acquired pneumonia & bacterial meningitis
   - concern for aspiration, and abnormal CXR
 add anaerobic coverage
   with: flagyl
   .
   #Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  Patient with evidence of multifocal pneumonia on
   admission XRAY with increased secretions. Initially he was hypothermic,
   then low grade fevers, now hypothermic again.  Most likely due to
   hospital acquired pneumonia. Obstructive sleep apnea is also likely
   contributing to hypoxia as patient with episodes of apnea and hypoxia
   when lying flat.
   - vancomycin, aztreonam for coverage of hospital acquired pneumonia
   - flagyl to cover anaerobes d/t aspiration possibility
   - DFA negative = discontinue tamiflu
   - will attempt to get better sputum sample (before extubation) and not
   double cover for pseudomonas at this time, given concerns for
   ciprofloxacin reducing seizure threshold and renal dysfunction making
   aminoglycosides less optimal
   - ABG and SBT this morning; hopefully plan for extubation
   .
   #Bradycardia: Patient states that he feels light-headed, but does not
   complain of chest pain or shortness of breath through event.  He had a
   temp of 95.6 and was warmed with bear hugger.  Had an EKG which showed
   sinus bradycardia with lateral STD which are old.  Electrolytes, coags,
   cardiac enzymes were drawn.  Cardiac enzymes were elevated, but this
   seems to be his baseline.  Records of EKG
s and d/c summaries show that
   he has these events and cardiology has been consulted in the past.  No
   invasive measures were taken.
   - consult cardiology when patient improves (?pacemaker; although
   concern for infection d/t recurrent UTIs)
   - continue to keep warm and monitor labs
   - atropine at bedside
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Patient found to have trop of 0.25 when having
   bradycardic event.  According to records, this seems to be his
   baseline.  Could be related to renal dysfunction.  Has had cardiology
   consulted in the past and no interventions were recommended.
   Regardless, repeated test this am (0.22), ASA given, EKG repeated.
   - repeat CE at 10am, with EKG???
   - discontinue aspirin (given thrombocytopenia)
   - cardiology consult, as above
   .
   #C5 spinal cord injury:
   - continue Baclofen pump, in place
   .
   #Chronic Kidney Disease:  Baseline Creatinine 1.5-1.7.  Currently at
   1.8 with elevated BUN.  History of chronic obstruction.
   - gentle hydration
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine

   #Hypernatremia: Could be due to dehydration in the setting of sepsis.
   - D5W boluses today; 500 ml q4 hours

   concern appeared more consistent with calcification.

   Summary for morning rounds:
   39 year old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic
   syndrome and recurrent urinary tract infections transferred for
   assessment of altered mental status.  Recent Klebsiella UTI treated
   with ertapenem and ciprofloxacin at [**Location (un) 78**]. Returns to [**Location (un) 78**]  with
   fatigue, low temps, and mild cough and congestion.  Initial vitals were
   notable for a temperature of 92.7.  Initial urinalysis was positive and
   he was started on ertapenem for presumed urinary tract infection.
   Subsequent culture has been negative.  He had a head CT which showed
   possible blood in the third ventricle.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
   On arrival to our emergency room his initial vital signs were: T 96.2
   P: 61 BP: 120/71 R: 14 O2 sat 96%RA. Seen by neurosurgery who
   recommended only platelets at this time.
   On admission the patient alert and oriented x 3 but more lethargic than
   usual.  Decreased strength in UE.  Witnessed tonic-clonic seizure X2
   while on floor with subsequent hypoxia.  PNA on CXR on admission, but
   also possible aspiration during event. T max on the floor has been
   100.8 and he was continued on meropenem out of concern for UTI.  He had
   an EEG which showed left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing.
   Patient altered on arrival to MICU.  Tracks, orients to voice. No
   purposeful answers to questions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He was admitted initially for altered mental status and weakness and is now in the MICU after experiencing two generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the floor with associated hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR, a recent urinary tract infection that was treated with antibiotics, and elevated troponin levels. He also has chronic kidney disease, hypernatremia, and a history of bradycardia. The patient is intubated for airway protection and to prepare for an MRI scan and lumbar puncture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and evidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent further infections and ensure proper coverage.
2. Seizures: The patient has experienced two generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and there is a concern for increased seizure frequency. Dilantin loading is recommended with levels checked 1 hour post-loading for goal level 15. It is also necessary to evaluate and manage any underlying causes of seizures.

   Changes to medical and family history:
   39 year old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic
   syndrome and recurrent urinary tract infections transferred for
   assessment of altered mental status.  Recent Klebsiella UTI treated
   with ertapenem and cipro at [**Location (un) 78**]. Returns to [**Location (un) 78**]  with fatigue,
   low temps, and mild cough and congestion.  Initial vitals were notable
   for a temperature of 92.7.  Initial urinalysis was positive and he was
   started on ertapenem for presumed urinary tract infection.  Subsequent
   culture has been negative.  He had a head CT which showed possible
   blood in the third ventricle.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
   On arrival to our emergency room his initial vs were: T 96.2 P: 61 BP:
   120/71 R: 14 O2 sat 96%RA. Seen by neurosurgery who recommended only
   platelets at this time.
   On admission the patient alert and oriented x 3 but more lethargic than
   usual.  Decreased strength in UE.  Witnessed tonic-clonic seizure X2
   while on floor with subsequent hypoxia.  PNA on CXR on admission, but
   also possible aspiration during event. T max on the floor has been
   100.8  and he was continued on meropenem out of concern for UTI.  He
   had an EEG which showed left mid to posterior temporal theta slowing.
   Patient altered on arrival to MICU.  Tracks, orients to voice. No

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 39 year old male with a history of C5
   quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome and recurrent urinary tract
   infections initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness
   now transferred to the MICU after two generalized tonic clonic seizures
   on the floor with associated hypoxia.
   Seizures:  Patient now with two generalized tonic clonic seizures since
   admission on [**2169-10-14**] after being seizure free since [**2169-2-22**].  His
   last tonic clonic seizure was in [**2162**]. Per notes he was taking Keppra
   1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] at the time of admission. Most concerning etiology of
   increased seizure frequency would be infection.  Although there was
   initially concern for intraventricular hemorrhage on repeat CT scan
   this was more consistent with calcification.  He has had a recent
   urinary tract infection for which he received a 7 day course of
   appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Urine culture on admission was
   negative.  Blood cultures have been negative. He has evidence of
   multifocal pneumonia on CXR. Sputum cultures have been contaminated.
   EEG is concerning for temporal slowing concerning for epileptiform
   activity.  Per neurology they would recommend dilantin loading now with
   levels checked 1 hour post-loading for goal level 15.  He will need to
   be intubated for airway protection as well as for MRI scanning and
   lumbar puncture.  Looking at patient's antibiotic regimen, meropenem is
   highly associated with decreasing seizure threshold and would ideally
   discontinue this medication.
   - continue infectious workup with repeat sputum cultures, blood, urine,
   influenza A probe, repeat CXR, stool for c. diff
   - dilantin loading now with 1000 mg
   - will check dilantin levels 1 hour post-loading with goal of 15
   - subsequently will start on dilantin 100 mg IV Q8H
   - will continue keppra 1000 mg IV BID
   - will plan to obtain MRI scan when clinically stable
   - will switch antibiotic regimen to vancomycin and aztreonam at
   meningitis dosing for coverage of hospital acquired pneumonia and
   bacterial meningitis
   - will discuss with interventional radiology ability to perform IR
   guided lumbar puncture given baclofen pump
   Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  Patient with evidence of multifocal pneumonia on
   admission XRAY with increased secretions. Initially he was hypothermic,
   now with low grade fevers.  Differential diagnosis includes hospital
   acquired pneumonia versus influenza.  Obstructive sleep apnea is also
   likely contributing to hypoxia as patient with episodes of apnea and
   hypoxia when lying flat.
   - influenza A swab
   - droplet precautions pending influenza swab
   - vancomycin, aztreonam for coverage of hospital acquired pneumonia
   - empiric tamiflu pending flu swab
   - will attempt to get better sputum sample and not double cover for
   pseudomonas at this time given concerns for ciprofloxacin reducing
   seizure threshold and renal dysfunction making aminoglycosides less
   optimal
   - will electively intubate given evidence that patient is protecting
   his airway and instability for MRI/LP
   C5 spinal cord injury:
   - continue baclofen
   - will discuss baclofen pump with pain service
   - will discuss with interventional radiology whether lumbar puncture
   can be performed
   Chronic Kidney Disease:  Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.7.  Currently at 1.8
   with elevated BUN.  History of chronic obstruction.
   - gentle hydration today
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   ? hemorrhage on CT scan:  On repeat CT scan here, area of concern
   appeared more consistent with calcification.
   - will better define on MRI scan
   Myelodysplastic Syndrome:  Currently blood counts are within his
   baseline.
   - trend blood counts

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He was initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness and is now in the MICU after experiencing two generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the floor with associated hypoxia. The patient has been seizure-free since February 22, 2012, but had a seizure in 2012. He was taking Keppra 1000 mg at the time of admission. There is concern for increased seizure frequency due to infection. The patient recently had a urinary tract infection for which he received a 7-day course of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Urine culture on admission was negative, and blood cultures have been negative. He has evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR. Sputum cultures have been contaminated. EEG results show temporal slowing and concern for epileptiform activity. Neurology recommends loading dilantin now with levels checked 1 hour post-loading for a goal level of 15. The patient will need to be intubated for airway protection as well as for MRI scanning and lumbar puncture. Meropenem, which is highly associated with decreasing seizure threshold, should be discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased seizure frequency due to infection
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia
3. Influenza infection
4. Chronic kidney disease
5. Myelodysplastic syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 39 year old male with a history of C5
   quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome and recurrent urinary tract
   infections initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness
   now transferred to the MICU after two generalized tonic clonic seizures
   on the floor with associated hypoxia and worsening mental status.
   #Seizures/AMS:  Patient now with two generalized tonic clonic seizures
   since admission on [**2169-10-14**] after being seizure free since [**2169-2-22**].
   His last tonic clonic seizure was in [**2162**]. Per notes he was taking
   Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] at the time of admission. Most concerning etiology
   of increased seizure frequency would be infection.  Although there was
   initially concern for intraventricular hemorrhage on repeat CT scan
   this was more consistent with calcification.  He has had a recent
   urinary tract infection for which he received a 7 day course of
   appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Urine culture on admission was
   negative.  Blood cultures have been negative. He has evidence of
   multifocal pneumonia on CXR. Sputum cultures have been contaminated.
   EEG is concerning for temporal slowing concerning for epileptiform
   activity.  Per neurology they would recommend dilantin loading now with
   levels checked 1 hour post-loading for goal level 15.  He will need to
   be intubated for airway protection as well as for MRI scanning and
   lumbar puncture.  Looking at patient's antibiotic regimen, meropenem is
   highly associated with decreasing seizure threshold and would ideally
   discontinue this medication.  DFA negative.  IR performed LP which
   looks non-infectious.
   - continue infectious workup with repeat sputum cultures, blood, urine,
   repeat CXR, stool for c. diff
   - dilantin levels 1 hour post-loading with goal of 15 were low; Need
   neuro/pharm recs on next dose.
   - dilantin 100 mg IV Q8H; change in dosing according to neuro
   - will continue keppra 1000 mg IV BID
   - will plan to obtain MRI scan when clinically stable
   - vancomycin and aztreonam at meningitis dosing for coverage of
   hospital acquired pneumonia and bacterial meningitis
   .
   #Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  Patient with evidence of multifocal pneumonia on
   admission XRAY with increased secretions. Initially he was hypothermic,
   then low grade fevers, now hypothermic again.  Most likely due to
   hospital acquired pneumonia. Obstructive sleep apnea is also likely
   contributing to hypoxia as patient with episodes of apnea and hypoxia
   when lying flat.
   - vancomycin, aztreonam for coverage of hospital acquired pneumonia
   - DFA negative, tamiflu can be stopped.
   - will attempt to get better sputum sample and not double cover for
   pseudomonas at this time given concerns for ciprofloxacin reducing
   seizure threshold and renal dysfunction making aminoglycosides less
   optimal
   - will electively intubate given evidence that patient is protecting
   his airway and instability for MRI/LP
   .
   #C5 spinal cord injury:
   - will discuss baclofen pump with pain service today, may need to be
   restarted.
   .
   #Chronic Kidney Disease:  Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.7.  Currently at
   1.8 with elevated BUN.  History of chronic obstruction.
   - gentle hydration
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Could be due to dehydration in the setting of sepsis
   - D5W boluses today; 500 ml q 4 hours
   .
   #? hemorrhage on CT scan:  On repeat CT scan here, area of concern
   appeared more consistent with calcification.
   - will better define on MRI scan
   .
   #Myelodysplastic Syndrome:  Currently blood counts are within his
   baseline.
   - trend blood counts
   .

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He was initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness. He now presents with two generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the floor, associated hypoxia, and worsening mental status. The patient is currently in the MICU.

The patient has a recent history of a urinary tract infection that was treated with antibiotics. His urine culture on admission was negative, but blood cultures have been negative as well. He also has evidence of multifocal pneumonia on chest X-ray. Sputum cultures have been contaminated.

The patient's EEG shows temporal slowing and concerns for epileptiform activity. Neurology recommends loading dilantin now with levels checked 1 hour post-loading for a goal level of 15. The patient needs to be intubated for airway protection as well as for an upcoming MRI scan and lumbar puncture.

The patient's antibiotic regimen includes meropenem, which is highly associated with decreasing the seizure threshold. It would ideally be discontinued. DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) negative. IR (infectious diseases) performed LP (lumbar puncture) that looks non-infectious.

The patient's current vitals include a temperature of 101.6, heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 117/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 39 year old male with a history of C5
   quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome and recurrent urinary tract
   infections initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness
   now transferred to the MICU after two generalized tonic clonic seizures
   on the floor with associated hypoxia and worsening mental status.
   .
   #Seizures/AMS:  Patient now with two generalized tonic-clonic seizures
   since admission on [**2169-10-14**] after being seizure free since [**2169-2-22**].
   His last tonic-clonic seizure was in [**2162**]. Per notes he was taking
   Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] at the time of admission. Most concerning etiology
   of increased seizure frequency would be infection.  Although there was
   initially concern for intraventricular hemorrhage on repeat CT scan
   this was more consistent with calcification. He has had a recent
   urinary tract infection for which he received a 7-day course of
   appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Urine and blood cultures have been
   negative thus far. He has evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR.
   Sputum cultures grew gm (+) cocci.  EEG is concerning for temporal
   slowing concerning for epileptiform activity.    Looking at patient's
   antibiotic regimen, meropenem is highly associated with decreasing
   seizure threshold and would ideally discontinue this medication.  DFA
   negative.  IR performed LP which looks non-infectious.
   - send cdiff sample this morning, was not sent yesterday.
   - neuro recs: continue keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **];  change to IV until
   tolerating po again. Continue dilantin in the short term, consider
   weaning off prior to discharge when acute illness resolved.  Would give
   additional 300mg bolus x1 as he never reached a level above 9.
   Continue maintenance dose of 100mg tid.  Check another trough level in
   the morning (ordered).
   - dilantin 100 mg IV Q8H; change in dosing according to neuron; level
   was low, so need to adjust dosing
   - will continue keppra 1000 mg IV BID
   - f/u MRI; still pending this morning
   - continue vancomycin,aztreonam, and flagyl for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia
   .
   #Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  Patient with evidence of multifocal pneumonia on
   admission XRAY with increased secretions. Initially he was hypothermic,
   then low grade fevers, now hypothermic again.  Most likely due to
   hospital acquired pneumonia. Obstructive sleep apnea is also likely
   contributing to hypoxia as patient with episodes of apnea and hypoxia
   when lying flat.
   - vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl  for coverage of hospital acquired
   pneumonia/ aspiration pneumonia
   - Flagyl started [**10-18**]
   .
   #Bradycardia: Patient states that he feels light-headed, but does not
   complain of chest pain or shortness of breath when bradycardic.  He had
   a temp of 95.6 and was warmed with bear hugger.  Had an EKG which
   showed sinus bradycardia with lateral STD which are old.  Electrolytes,
   coags, cardiac enzymes were drawn.  Cardiac enzymes were elevated, but
   this seems to be his baseline.  Records of EKG
s and d/c summaries show
   that he has these events and cardiology has been consulted in the
   past.  No invasive measures were taken.
   - consult cardiology when patient improves (?pacemaker; although
   concern for infection d/t recurrent UTIs)
   - continue to keep warm and monitor labs
   - atropine at bedside
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Patient found to have trop of 0.25 when having
   bradycardic event.  According to records, this seems to be his
   baseline.  Could be related to renal dysfunction.  Has had cardiology
   consulted in the past and no interventions were recommended.
   Regardless, repeated test this am (0.22), ASA given, EKG repeated.
   - discontinue aspirin (given thrombocytopenia)
   - cardiology consult, as above
   .
   #C5 spinal cord injury:
   - continue Baclofen pump, in place
   - PT consult
   .
   #Depression:
   - on home Zoloft
   - Social work consult because worsening depression since new seizures
   .
   #Chronic Kidney Disease:  Baseline Creatinine 1.5-1.7.  Currently at
   1.8 with elevated BUN.  History of chronic obstruction.
   - gentle hydration
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose medications
   - trend creatinine
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Could be due to dehydration in the setting of sepsis.
   - D5W boluses today; 500 ml q4 hours
   - Follow-up Na this afternoon.
   .
   # Question- hemorrhage on CT scan:  On repeat CT scan here, area of
   concern appeared more consistent with calcification.
   - will better define on MRI scan

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He was initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness and later transferred to the MICU after experiencing two generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the floor, associated with hypoxia, and worsening mental status. The patient has been on multiple medications including antibiotics, antiepileptics, and other medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR, and sputum cultures grew gram-positive cocci. He also had a recent urinary tract infection for which he received antibiotic therapy. There is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Seizures: The patient has had two generalized tonic-clonic seizures since admission, indicating increased seizure frequency. The EEG shows temporal slowing concerning for epileptiform activity.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has episodes of bradycardia, which can be related to obstructive sleep apnea or an underlying cardiac condition.

5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.5-1.7, currently at 1.8, indicating worsening kidney function.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which could be due to dehydration in the setting of sepsis.
7. Hemorrhage on CT scan: The initial CT scan showed an area of concern, but it appeared more consistent with calcification on repeat imaging.
8. Myelodysplastic Syndrome: The patient has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome, and his blood counts are within his baseline.

Plan:
1. Continue appropriate antibiotic therapy for pneumonia.
2. Adjust antiepileptic medications to optimize seizure control.
3. Consult cardiology for bradycardia and consider pacemaker placement.
4. Discontinue aspirin due to thrombocytopenia.
5. Monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
6. Provide gentle hydration and monitor urine output for hypernatremia.
7. Follow-up with MRI scan for further evaluation of the area of concern on CT scan.
8. Trend blood counts for myelodysplastic syndrome."

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of C5 quadriplegia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He was initially admitted for altered mental status and weakness and later transferred to the MICU after experiencing two generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the floor, along with associated hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR and sputum cultures grew gram-positive cocci. He also has a recent urinary tract infection for which he received a 7-day course of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures have been negative thus far. The patient's EEG is concerning for temporal slowing concerning for epileptiform activity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR. The sputum cultures grew gram-positive cocci, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The patient's immunocompromised state due to myelodysplastic syndrome makes him more susceptible to infections.
2. Seizures: The patient has had two generalized tonic-clonic seizures since admission, which could be attributed to an underlying infection or other factors. It is crucial to manage his seizures appropriately to prevent further episodes.
3. Hypoxia/Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Adequate treatment with antibiotics is necessary to address this condition.
