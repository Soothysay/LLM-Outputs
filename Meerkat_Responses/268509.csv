   60 F with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and evidence of
   pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and relatively high
   oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia most likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production pointing to a community-acquired
   pneumonia. Ideally would receive atypical coverage (such as
   azithromycin) as well as coverage with a beta-lactam antibiotic. We are
   severely limited currently due to reported tounge swelling penicillin
   allergy. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Must also consider an
   acute worsening of ILD. Oxygen sats have been stable in the ICU.
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin and Levofloxacin at this time and consult ID for
   better ICU CAP coverage in this penicillin allergic patient with
   additionally reported carbapenem as well as aztreonam allergy.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Pulmonary hygiene with chest physiotherapy, up to chair as tolerated,
   humidified oxygen, nebs
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen as tolerated
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104**] in order to discuss her care as related to her
   underlying ILD
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Somewhat erratic glycemic control overnight
   with FSBS in the mid-200s. On insulin pump with [**Last Name (STitle) 1565**]. Would likely
   benefit from tighter glycemic control while acutely ill.
   - Consult [**Last Name (un) 72**] to assist in blood sugar management
   - Low threshold to start insulin gtt
   - Diabetic diet when diet is initiated
   # Metabolic acidosis:
   Likely contribution of lactic acid and beginnings of DKA. At
   presentation had mildly elevated lactate as well as ketones in the
   urine. This AM her AG is 10.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She presented with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements.

24-hour events include the management of fingerstick blood sugars above assay with subcutaneous insulin, administration of breathing treatments with relief of dyspnea and wheezing, and ongoing intermittent rigors. The patient reports some thirst.

Allergies include penicillins, causing anaphylaxis, and lamictal (oral), resulting in a rash. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin.

Current infusions include meperidine (Demerol) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/39 mmHg to 120/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 5L nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Physical examination findings include tachypneic appearance, slight rigor"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 F with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and evidence of
   pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and relatively high
   oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will now need esophageal ballon, a-line and
   adjustment of vent settings. Bronch after vent. Is settled. Still would
   treat PNA, ideally with atypical coverage (such as azithromycin) as
   well as coverage with a beta-lactam antibiotic. We are severely limited
   currently due to reported tounge swelling penicillin allergy. Urine
   legionella antigen is negative. Can obtain BAL/mini-BAL for culture.
   - esophageal balloon, a-line, adjustment of vent settings
   - BAL vs. mini-BAL
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin and Levofloxacin at this time and consult ID for
   better ICU CAP coverage in this penicillin allergic patient with
   additionally reported carbapenem as well as aztreonam allergy.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Somewhat erratic glycemic control overnight
   with FSBS in the mid-200s then 80 this morning. On insulin drip with
   [**Last Name (un) 72**] following. Would likely benefit from tighter glycemic control
   while acutely ill.
   - cont insulin drip
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] recs
   # Metabolic acidosis:
   Likely contribution of lactic acid and beginnings of DKA. At
   presentation had mildly elevated lactate as well as ketones in the
   urine. This AM her AG is 11.
   - Management of infection/sepsis/hyperglycemia
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to intubation and tracheostomy placement. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with an esophageal balloon and arterial line. Bronchoscopy has been performed.

The patient has a penicillin allergy, limiting antibiotic options. Urine Legionella antigen is negative, but further cultures are needed. The patient is also allergic to carbapenem and aztreonam.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been erratic, ranging from mid-200s to 80 mg/dL. She is on an insulin drip and would benefit from tighter glycemic control.

There is evidence of lactic acidosis and early diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's anion gap (AG) is 11.

Other findings include leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.2 K/uL, elevated CRP of 261 K/uL, and slightly elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's current hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia and poor baseline pulmonary function. She requires aggressive management with bronchoscopic interventions and adjustments to her ventilator settings.
2. Infection/sepsis:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and suspected infection. The patient required urgent intubation due to difficulty in achieving a secure airway. An LMA (Laryngeal Mask Airway) was placed temporarily. Insulin drip has been initiated for glycemic control, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been prescribed. The patient's vital signs show a fever with a Tmax of 38.3°C (100.9°F), tachypnea with a RR of 27 breaths per minute, and hypotension with a BP of 120/55 mmHg. The patient's ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.44. Physical examination reveals diffuse posterior fine crackles, bibasilar posterior coarse crackles, inspiratory squeaks bilaterally, and rare wheezes. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, increased glucose levels, and altered renal function tests. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's code status is set to full code, and the disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and the presence of crackles on lung auscultation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and requires high levels of oxygen supplementation. Her current condition is complicated by fever, leukocytosis, and sputum production, which suggests a community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Due to the patient's reported penicillin allergy and previous exposure to certain antibiotics, the treatment plan includes vancomycin and levofloxacin, with consultation from an infectious diseases (ID) specialist for better ICU CAP coverage. Other interventions include continuing albuterol and ipratropium nebs, pulmonary hygiene with chest physiotherapy, and liberating from supplemental oxygen as tolerated. The patient also has diabetes/hyperglycemia, which requires tight glycemic control, and there is a concern for metabolic acidosis. The patient's depression should be managed with continued home medications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic. The patient required urgent intubation this morning due to difficulty in achieving a secure airway. The patient is currently on an insulin drip, with plans to change antibiotics if pseudomonas is suspected and decompensates. Increased vancomycin dosing has been given due to improved renal function.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), blood pressure ranging from 120/55 to 197/98 mmHg, heart rate between 74-103 bpm, respiratory rate of 23-45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a height of 64 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,182 mL, including 753 mL IV fluids, and total output of 1,255 mL, including 753 mL urine output.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through high flow nebulization and has an ABG result of 7.44/32/42/19/0, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 42. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and skin, neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count ranging from 11.5 to 14.2 K/uL, hemoglobin from 29.6 to 32.4 g/dL, platelet count from 247 to 562 K/uL, creatinine from 1.0 to 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 152 and 247 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range. The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute on chronic, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay, there is an increased risk of developing nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of corticosteroids may predispose them to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 F with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and evidence of
   pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and relatively high
   oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Endotracheal sputum
   with two poor samples prior to good sample this morning with no
   organisms on gram stain. Ventilation was initially volume control. On
   rounds this AM patient switched to PSV and appears comfortable on 5 of
   pressure support above PEEP of 16.
   - Maintain on PSV at this time and repeat ABG later today
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   - Bronchoscopy today with bacterial and viral cultures
   - Follow-up sputum culture
   - Rapid respiratory viral screen today with PCP DFA

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus type 1. She was admitted to the MICU with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient experienced respiratory distress in the early morning and required intubation and tracheostomy. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient has leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function. She also has positive dental cultures for candida and negative urine Legionella antigen. The patient's condition has worsened, with diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi in the lungs, and she is minimally responsive to voice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and risk factors such as previous pneumonia, there is a potential for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible AKI. Monitoring fluid balance, urine output, and renal function will be important.
3. Nosocomial infections: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 F with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and evidence of
   pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and relatively high
   oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will now need esophageal ballon, a-line and
   adjustment of vent settings. Bronch after vent. Is settled. Still would
   treat PNA, ideally with atypical coverage (such as azithromycin) as
   well as coverage with a beta-lactam antibiotic. We are severely limited
   currently due to reported tounge swelling penicillin allergy. Urine
   legionella antigen is negative. Can obtain BAL/mini-BAL for culture.
   - esophageal balloon, a-line, adjustment of vent settings
   - BAL vs. mini-BAL
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin and Levofloxacin at this time and consult ID for
   better ICU CAP coverage in this penicillin allergic patient with
   additionally reported carbapenem as well as aztreonam allergy.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Somewhat erratic glycemic control overnight
   with FSBS in the mid-200s then 80 this morning. On insulin drip with
   [**Last Name (un) 72**] following. Would likely benefit from tighter glycemic control
   while acutely ill.
   - cont insulin drip
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] recs
   # Metabolic acidosis:
   Likely contribution of lactic acid and beginnings of DKA. At
   presentation had mildly elevated lactate as well as ketones in the
   urine. This AM her AG is 11.
   - Management of infection/sepsis/hyperglycemia
   # Depression:

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I) admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory status worsened, leading to intubation and tracheostomy. She is currently sedated with fentanyl and versed, mechanically ventilated, and receiving fluids and blood products. The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and sputum production consistent with community-acquired pneumonia. She also has poor glycemic control, metabolic acidosis, and a history of penicillin allergy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to her underlying ILD, baseline abnormal lungs, fever, leukocytosis, and sputum production. Acute worsening of respiratory status requiring intubation and tracheostomy further complicates her respiratory condition. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Infection/Septic Shock: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and sputum production indicate a possible infection. Given her immunocompromised state and poor baseline lung function, there is a high risk of septic shock. Aggressive management of infection with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care is crucial.
3. Diabetes/Hyperglycemia: The patient's erratic glyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with respiratory failure. The patient required multiple attempts at intubation due to respiratory distress and subsequent trauma to the teeth. A tracheostomy was performed, and the patient was placed on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode. The patient has been sedated with fentanyl and versed. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it has been ruled out by [Doctor Last Name 76]. The patient also has hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of nosocomial infections.
5. ARDS: Although currently ruled out, there is still a risk of developing ARDS due to the severity of the initial respiratory failure.
6. Tooth infection: The trauma during intubation may have caused dental injury, leading to infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and desaturation to the 70s. He was intubated in the MICU with multiple attempts by anesthesia. The patient underwent tooth trauma and tracheostomy in the operating room. He is currently on the ARDS protocol with sedation using fentanyl and versed. An arterial line and esophageal balloon have been placed. The patient is awaiting nutrition recommendations for tube feeding and a plan for CT head when stable. He spiked a fever of 101.6 degrees at 0400 on [2200-4-3], and blood and urine cultures have been sent.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community acquired (CAP) - The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a bacterial infection acquired from the community. This condition requires prompt treatment with antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS) - The patient is experiencing severe respiratory distress, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation. This acute respiratory failure is not consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, with persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements. She was intubated and underwent a tracheostomy due to respiratory distress. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, initially volume control and now pressure support ventilation (PSV). She has spikes in temperature, leukocytosis, and sputum production, indicating community-acquired pneumonia on top of her poor baseline. Urine Legionella antigen is negative. Bronchoscopy with bacterial and viral cultures will be performed today, along with follow-up sputum culture and rapid respiratory viral screen with PCP DFA. The patient will continue on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole. She requires ongoing ID input.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)
3. Barotrauma
4. Sepsis
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
6. Pneumothorax
7. Tracheostomy-related complications

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus type 1. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She required intubation and tracheostomy due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole), bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium), and insulin for hyperglycemia.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.8°F (38.8°C), heart rate between 77-87 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/53-119/54 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is sedated and follows simple commands.

Physical examination reveals a tracheostomy, moist oral mucosa, supple neck, diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi anteriorly, a normal sinus rhythm with a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, and soft and non-tender abdomen.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23.0 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 1.1 mmol/L, and impaired glucose tolerance with a blood glucose level of 150 mg"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and symptoms of infection may indicate the possibility of sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Barotrauma: The high PIP and PEEP values suggest the potential risk of barotrauma.
4. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): The high pressures used in ventilation may cause lung injury.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheter placement increase the risk of DVT.
6. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation can predispose the patient to stress ulcers.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level of 62 mg/dL indicates hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea
   and evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Endotracheal sputum
   with two poor samples prior to good sample this morning with no
   organisms on gram stain. Ventilation was initially volume control. On
   rounds this AM patient switched to PSV and appears comfortable on 5 of
   pressure support above PEEP of 16.
   - Maintain on PSV at this time and repeat ABG later today
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - trial of diuresis today
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking to ~101F overnight and this
   morning. Has new cultures pending. Will check LFT
s, lipase,
   differential looking for other brewing infection
   - check LFT
s, lipase, differential
   - f/u cultures
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. Over the course of the day, the patient's condition has been unstable. They experienced desaturation requiring an increase in FiO2 to 80% and then briefly to 100% due to desaturation during repositioning. The patient was unable to tolerate tube feeds and had high residuals, leading to the decision to hold feeds and start Reglan. Feeds were later restarted after residuals came down. The patient also required an increase in sedation (fentanyl/versed 25/1). No bowel movement was noted by midnight. The patient's antibiotics were adjusted, with an increase in vancomycin to 1250mg q12h.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for the patient:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The presence of fever and respiratory symptoms may indicate an infection.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, particularly in the legs. Prophylactic measures should be in place to prevent DVT.

3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness, such as being in the ICU, can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea
   and evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Endotracheal sputum
   with two poor samples prior to good sample this morning with no
   organisms on gram stain. Ventilation was initially volume control. On
   rounds this AM patient switched to PSV and appears comfortable on 5 of
   pressure support above PEEP of 16.  Tolerated trial of lasix.
   - Maintain on PSV at this time and repeat ABG later today
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
 rec vanco trough now dosing higher dose
   of vanco
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   - will increase solumedrol today to 125mg q6 from q8 yesterday
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking to ~101F overnight and the
   morning of [**4-4**].  Has new cultures pending.
   - f/u cultures
   - cont vanco, levo, flagyl
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She presented with persistent tachypnea and relatively high oxygen requirements.

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced fever spikes to approximately 101.5°F. Her respiratory status worsened, requiring an increase in FiO2 to 80% and briefly reaching 100% due to desaturation during repositioning. She was unable to tolerate tube feeds and had high residuals, which were temporarily held. Reglan was started, and feeds were restarted after the residuals came down.

The patient also required an increase in sedation (fentanyl/versed 25/1) and had no bowel movement as of midnight. The dose of vancomycin was increased to 1250mg q12h. 

On examination, her vital signs included a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/52 to 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her heart rhythm was sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance showed a total intake of 2607 mL and output of 1517 mL. She received f"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient has been experiencing fever, requiring an increase in FiO2 to 80% and briefly to 100% due to desaturation during repositioning. The patient also had difficulty tolerating tube feeds, leading to high residuals and the initiation of Reglan. The patient's sedation was increased as well.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, which resulted in the discontinuation of Levofloxacin. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and metronidazole. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 101.5 F (38.6 C), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/52 mmHg to 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 70% FiO2. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received various infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam (versed), insulin, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and furosemide (Lasix). The patient's fluids have been managed, with a total intake of 2,607 mL and output of 1,517 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume of 616 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea
   and evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Endotracheal sputum
   with two poor samples prior to good sample this morning with no
   organisms on gram stain. Ventilation was initially volume control. On
   rounds this AM patient switched to PSV and appears comfortable on 5 of
   pressure support above PEEP of 16.  Tolerated trial of lasix.
   - Maintain on PSV at this time and repeat ABG later today
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking to ~101F overnight and the
   morning of [**4-4**].  Has new cultures pending.
   - f/u cultures
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the MICU with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and requires high levels of supplemental oxygen.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, fever, diabetes/hyperglycemia, and depression. She is receiving treatment for pneumonia, including antibiotics such as vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient's respiratory status has been acutely worsened, requiring intubation and tracheostomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's history of ILD and poor pulmonary reserve increases the risk of respiratory complications. The use of a tracheostomy may help reduce the risk of VAP by allowing for weaning off mechanical ventilation and improving airway hygiene. However, there is still a risk of developing VAP or VILI due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.

The patient's diabetes/hyperglycemia needs to be closely monitored, as hyperglycemia can increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing. Maintaining good glycemic control is essential in this case.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 117/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactate levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with ARDS. The patient has received multiple antibiotic regimens and is currently on vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Ventilator-Associated Events: The patient may be at risk for ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis, or ventilator-associated events of unknown etiology.
3. Delirium: Sedation and the ICU environment can contribute to the development of delir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and insulin for glycemic control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 117/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at PEEP of 16 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, and a respiratory system resistance of 22 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, PaO2 of 107 mmHg, HCO3- of 24 mEq/L, and base excess of -0.9 mEq/L. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.2 K/uL, elevated glucose levels of 182 mg/dL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and pneumonia, which indicates an infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or development of new infections while in the ICU.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to the pneumonia. Monitoring the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to ensure proper respiratory support and prevent further deterioration.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. Close monitoring of blood sugar levels and administration of insulin as needed are essential to maintain glycemic control and prevent complications associated with high blood sugar levels.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,607 mL and output of 1,729 mL, indicating a negative fluid balance. It is important to monitor the patient's fluid status closely to prevent dehydration or fluid overload.

5. Thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures, such as early ambulation and anticoagulation therapy, should be considered.

6. Medication Reactions: The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and lamotrigine. Monitoring for any adverse drug reactions"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth at this time. Had rapid viral antigens return as
   negative. PCP stain was negative. Patient has been ventilated on
   pressure support 5 over 16 of PEEP and has been tolerating aside from
   brief desaturations. FiO2 currently at 60%.
   - Maintain on PSV at this time
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   - Follow-up BAL cultures
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Send suction specimen for culture today
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   - Will maintain solumedrol at 125mg every 6 hours
   - Fluid balance even to negative 500 mL
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking to ~101F overnight and the

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ILD and diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the MICU with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and requires high levels of oxygen. The patient's current hypoxia is likely due to her underlying lung condition, fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia). She has been intubated and tracheostomized, and is being ventilated on pressure support over PEEP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's poor pulmonary reserve and acute worsening respiratory status put her at risk for continued hypoxia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient has been intubated for an extended period, she is at risk for developing VAP. Regular suctioning of the tracheostomy tube and follow-up cultures are important to prevent and identify this condition.
3. Infection: The patient has been febrile and has received broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is important to follow up with blood and urine cultures, as well as sputum cultures, to determine the causative organism and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
4. Diabetes/hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels to maintain"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Endotracheal sputum
   with two poor samples prior to good sample this morning with no
   organisms on gram stain. Ventilation was initially volume control. On
   rounds this AM patient switched to PSV and appears comfortable on 5 of
   pressure support above PEEP of 16.  Tolerated trial of lasix.
   - Maintain on PSV at this time and repeat ABG later today
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   - f/u BAL cultures
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
 rec vanco trough now dosing higher dose
   of vanco
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   - will increase solumedrol today to 125mg q6 from q8 yesterday
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking to ~101F overnight and the
   morning of [**4-4**].  Has new cultures pending.
   - f/u cultures
   - cont vanco, levo, flagyl
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient required intubation and tracheostomy due to worsening respiratory status and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, and blood and urine cultures have been sent. She is receiving vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole as part of her antibiotic regimen. The patient's diabetes and hyperglycemia are being managed with an insulin drip.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of ILD and poor pulmonary reserve, which puts her at risk for poor oxygenation. Her current hypoxia is likely due to community-acquired pneumonia and may worsen if not adequately managed.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and monitor for this condition.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin subcutaneous and pneumoboots should be continued.

4. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can lead to stress"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing hypoxia and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and hyperglycemia. The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature, increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 87 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 16 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 125 mmHg, oxygen consumption (VO2) of 13.6 L/min, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 125.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.2 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) level of 26.4%, platelet count (Plt) of 242, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL, total bilirubin (Tbili) of 25.0%, glucose level of 182 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia (K+ of 3.4 mEq/L), hyponatremia (Na+ of 137 mg/dL), and hypermagnesemia (Mg++ of 2.3 mg/dL).

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi anteriorly, a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border (LLSB), and decreased breath sounds in the bases. Neurological assessment shows sedation, withdrawal to painful stimuli, and no response to commands.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, oxygen toxicity, ICU-acquired weakness, delirium, and nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a fever of 101.3°F, desaturation episodes, and is suspected to have pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 79 bpm, slightly elevated blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and an oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and potassium levels. The patient's glucose level is also elevated. Imaging shows a stable chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment includes fever of unknown origin, suspected to be originating from the lungs, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection spread, further deterioration of kidney function, and uncontrolled diabetes. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation, and laboratory results, and adjust treatment accordingly."

The patient's temperature is 101.3°F, heart rate is 79 bpm, blood pressure is 122/46 mmHg, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2 of 125 mmHg, and HCO3- of 75 mEq/L. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows stable diffuse infiltrates. The patient's medical history is significant for pneumonia, ARDS, hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, insulin, and diuretics. The patient's current condition is complicated by fever of unknown origin, bacterial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Organ dysfunction:"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth at this time. Had rapid viral antigens return as
   negative. PCP stain was negative. Patient has been ventilated on
   pressure support 5 over 16 of PEEP and has been tolerating aside from
   brief desaturations. FiO2 currently at 60%.
   - Maintain on PSV at this time
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   - Follow-up BAL cultures
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Send suction specimen for culture today
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   - Will maintain solumedrol at 125mg every 6 hours
   - Fluid balance even to negative 500 mL
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking to ~101F overnight and the
   morning of [**4-4**].  Has new blood and urine cultures pending. All blood
   cultures and urine cultures negative thus far.
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - Send stool for c.diff
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ILD and diabetes mellitus, admitted to the ICU with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements. The patient's condition has worsened, requiring intubation and tracheostomy. She is currently on pressure support ventilation with PEEP and FiO2 at 60%. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending, and there are concerns about potential infections, including a possible PICC line infection. The patient also has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with an insulin drip.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and the risk of aspiration.
2. Hospital-acquired infections: There is a concern for a PICC line infection, and further investigation is needed.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although currently not evident, the patient's diabetes needs close monitoring for any signs of DKA.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: Stool culture sent to rule out this possibility.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures are in place, but there is still a risk due to immobility.
6. Stress ulcer: Prophylactic medication is being administered to prevent stress ulcers.
7. Hypoxia: The patient's baseline lung function is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been experiencing a fever of 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit and has been started on antipyretic medications. Blood cultures have been sent, and the patient is being cooled with Arctic Sun. The patient also has a concern for a possible PICC infection, leading to a 10-day course of Vancomycin and a 4-day course of metronidazole. Due to high vancomycin trough levels, the morning dose was held and then reinitiated at 1000 mg Q12H with the evening dose.

The patient's potassium level was low at 2.9 mEq/L, so they were given 40 mEq IV and 40 mEq PO. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, arterial line, and tracheostomy tube. The arterial line was temporarily stopped and then restarted. Blood cultures were obtained from the newly placed arterial line. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 24, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and ABG results.

Physical examination findings include a tracheostomy with secretions, moist oral mucosa, diffuse coarse crackles and rh"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing high fever, possible infection, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and pneumonia. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, insulin, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are unstable with fluctuating blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. He requires mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's high fever, leukocytosis, and possible infection suggest a potential septic state. This condition can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and even death if not promptly treated.

2. Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's respiratory failure and altered lab values, there is a risk of MODS. This syndrome occurs when multiple organs fail due to severe illness or injury.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. This type of pneumonia is caused by bacterial infection acquired during the time spent on a mechanical ventilator.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots, such as DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth at this time. Had rapid viral antigens return as
   negative. PCP stain was negative. Patient has been having episodes of
   brief desaturations which seem to be related to some anxiety.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements.

The patient's current medical complications include hypoxia, fever, diabetes/hyperglycemia, and depression. She is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia, insulin for glycemic control, bronchodilators for respiratory support, and other ICU care medications.

The patient has undergone various interventions, such as arterial line placement, tracheostomy, and suctioning specimen collection. Her vital signs have been monitored, and she has been on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's history of ILD and baseline abnormal lungs likely contributes to her poor pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia may be related to fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on top of poor baseline lung function. The patient's worsening respiratory status has required intubation and tracheostomy. Close monitoring of oxygenation and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.

2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking to ~101F overnight and the morning of [**4-4**]. She"

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ILD and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the MICU with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. Since admission, she has had persistent tachypnea and relatively high oxygen requirements. She required intubation and tracheostomy due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient is currently being treated with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole for suspected community-acquired pneumonia. Her urine Legionella antigen is negative, and sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples show no growth at this time. Rapid viral antigens have also returned negative, and PCP stain was negative.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of brief desaturations, which seem to be related to anxiety. She has intermittent spikes of fever to ≥101F, with new blood and urine cultures pending. All blood cultures and urine cultures thus far have been negative, but she is cdiff positive.

The patient's diabetes and hyperglycemia are being managed with an insulin drip, and she is showing improved glycemic control. Her depression and anxiety are being addressed with her home medications, including Zyprexa to help decrease anxiety and hypoxic episodes.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who presented with infiltrates and pneumonia (PNA). She underwent difficult intubation and was tracheostomized in the operating room. She continues to be on mechanical ventilation and has been febrile. The patient has been receiving empirical therapy for PNA. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.8°F, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/44 mmHg to 90/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is sedated and unresponsive. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Her blood cultures were obtained, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory failure is due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD) and PNA. She is being treated with high-dose steroids for ILD and receiving empirical therapy for PNA. The plan includes attempting pressure support ventilation (PSV) and weaning sedation. 

The patient has interstitial lung disease, for which the plan is to reduce steroids. Her fevers are unclear in origin, and the plan is to continue monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain
   was negative. Patient has been ventilated on pressure support 10 over
   16 of PEEP and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2
   currently at 50%, which has improved in last three days.
   - Attempt to decrease PEEP slowly
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole for 10 total days,
   ending on [**2200-4-11**]
   - Vancomycin trough this PM
   - Send suction specimen for culture today
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   - Will maintain solumedrol at 125mg every 12 hours and continue to
   taper down
   - Fluid balance even to negative 500 mL
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight. Had fever to 101.3
   Has new blood and urine cultures pending. All blood cultures and urine
   cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff negative. Will start to consider
   other causes of fever at this time.
   - Medication review for causes of pyrexia
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - Send stool for c.diff
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   #Hypernatremia:
   Newly increased to 149 today.
   - Increase free water flushes in tube feeds to 100 mL every 4 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Increase glargine to 10 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ILD and DM I who was admitted with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on CXR. She required MICU admission due to persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements. The patient has been intubated and tracheostomized, and is currently ventilated on pressure support 10 over 16 of PEEP. Her hypoxia is likely related to her poor pulmonary reserve, fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production. Despite negative urine and sputum cultures, she continues to have periodic oxygen desaturations requiring increased sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's current hypoxia is likely worsened by her underlying ILD and pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking fevers, indicating an ongoing infectious process. Further evaluation is needed to identify the cause of the fever, considering the negative blood and urine cultures.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has developed hypernatremia, which should be managed by increasing free water flushes in tube feeds.
4. Diabetes/Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes needs to be closely monitored and managed with insulin therapy.
5. Depression: The patient's depression should be addressed and her home medications should be continued.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth at this time. Had rapid viral antigens return as
   negative. PCP stain was negative. Patient has been ventilated on
   pressure support 5 over 16 of PEEP and has been tolerating aside from
   brief desaturations. FiO2 currently at 60%.
   - Maintain on PSV at this time
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   - Follow-up BAL cultures
   - Follow-up sputum cultures
   - Send suction specimen for culture today
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   - Will maintain solumedrol at 125mg every 6 hours
   - Fluid balance even to negative 500 mL
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking to ~101F overnight and the
   morning of [**4-4**].  Has new blood and urine cultures pending. All blood
   cultures and urine cultures negative thus far.
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - Send stool for c.diff
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM I). She was admitted with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements.

The patient is currently in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and is intubated with a tracheostomy tube. She is being ventilated on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with 16 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and has been tolerating well, except for brief desaturations. The FiO2 is currently at 60%.

The patient has a fever, with temperatures ranging from 38.5°C to 101.3°F. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and all blood cultures and urine cultures are negative thus far. The patient also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL.

The patient's diabetes/hyperglycemia is being managed with an insulin drip, which has improved glycemic control. She has no current evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Other findings include a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border (LLSB), coarse crackles and rhonchi anteriorly with expiratory wheezing, and a tracheost"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and a fever of 101.3°F. The patient continues to require sedation to prevent desaturation episodes and has been placed on standing Zyprexa. Lasix has been increased. The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins and lamictal. The patient has received various antibiotics over the past few days.

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.5°C, current temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/44 to 165/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,659 mL (including 970 mL IVF) and output of 3,112 mL (including 1,415 mL urine). The NG output is 547 mL and stool output is -445 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of 547 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 168 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 10.7 L/min.

Physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's glucose level is also elevated.

Assessment and plan include activity intolerance, ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin (FUO), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hyperglycemia, and ICU care. The patient is receiving Ensure nutrition and has multiple lines, including a PICC line, central venous catheter, and arterial line. Prophylaxis measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, atelectasis, stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and nosocomial infections due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain
   was negative. Patient has been ventilated on pressure support 10 over
   16 of PEEP and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2
   currently at 50%, which has improved in last three days.
   - Attempt to decrease PEEP slowly
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole for 10 total days,
   ending on [**2200-4-11**]
   - Vancomycin trough this PM
   - Send suction specimen for culture today
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs regarding new tracheostomy
   - Will maintain solumedrol at 125mg every 12 hours and continue to
   taper down
   - Fluid balance even to negative 500 mL
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight. Had fever to 101.3
   Has new blood and urine cultures pending. All blood cultures and urine
   cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff negative. Will start to consider
   other causes of fever at this time.
   - Medication review for causes of pyrexia
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - Send stool for c.diff
   - Continue Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole
   #Hypernatremia:
   Newly increased to 149 today.
   - Increase free water flushes in tube feeds to 100 mL every 4 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has been complicated by persistent tachypnea and relatively high oxygen requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ILD and diabetes mellitus who was admitted with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She was transferred to the MICU due to persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements. The patient has been intubated and tracheostomized, and is currently ventilated on pressure support over PEEP. Her urine and blood cultures are negative, but she remains febrile. She has been treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has poor pulmonary reserve due to her history of ILD and baseline abnormal lungs. Her current hypoxia is likely related to her fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.

2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking with fever despite negative blood and urine cultures. Other potential causes of pyrexia should be considered, such as medication review, clotting disorders, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further investigation is required, including pending blood and urine cultures, liver function tests, lipase levels, and consideration of an upper extremity ultrasound for clot.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is elevated at 148 m"

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of decreased PEEP from 16 to 12. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, anaphylaxis from Lamictal, and rash. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit and tachycardia with a heart rate between 66-101 beats per minute. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 710-852 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 174 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg. The patient has diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi in the lungs, a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border (LLSB), and is sedated with midazolam and fentanyl. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of allergies to penicillins and lamictal, as well as a previous admission for pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. He has been experiencing fever, hyperglycemia, and potential pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 63-113 mmHg, heart rate between 66-101 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever and potential pneumonia, suggest a possible infection in the lungs. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and may require additional antibiotics or interventions.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which could necessitate increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in severe cases.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been observed to have elevated blood glucose levels on multiple occasions. This can increase the risk of complications such as infections, poor wound healing, and further organ dysfunction.

4. DVT/PE: Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embol"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She continues to have fevers with no clear source. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and insulin. She is also on a ventilator with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 0.883 mL/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate between 66-101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/38-161/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary.
2. Barotrauma: The high levels of PEEP and positive pressure ventilation can cause barotrauma, leading to lung injury. Regular assessment of chest X-rays and respiratory status is essential.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,549 mL and output of 4,660 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating a negative fluid balance. This may increase the risk of kidney injury"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain
   was negative. Patient is ventilated on pressure support 10 over 12 of
   PEEP and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2
   currently at 50%, which has improved in last three days.
   - wean vent as tolerates to trach collar.
   - All abx discontinued as unclear source of treatment.  Monitor status
   off abx
   - f/u cultures
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - will contact thoracic surgery concerning trach sutures
   - d/c steroids today.
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for
   days. Had fever to 101.5.  Has new blood and urine cultures pending.
   All blood cultures and urine cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff
   negative. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time.
   LFT normal.  All abx discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of
   treatment and continued fevers despite adequate course and selection of
   empiric antibiotics.  Persistently elevated LDH likely from underlying
   lung disease.
   - Medication review for causes of pyrexia
   - BUE U/S r/o DVT as source of fever.
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - check LFTs, lipase, consider RUQ ultrasound if suspicious labs
   #Hypernatremia: at 148 today.
   - free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 4 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Increase glargine to 10 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   - discuss with pharmacy regarding mixing abx and other meds in NS
   rather than D5
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She is currently intubated and tracheostomized, receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support and PEEP.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/42 to 157/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 50%. Her physical examination reveals diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi anteriorly, a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, and no other significant findings.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.9 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 3.0 mmol/L, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures are pending, but all previous results have been negative. Other lab values indicate possible electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia at 148 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins and lamotrigine, as well as previous antibiotic use. She is currently receiving multiple medications, including furosemide, midazolam, and he"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.
- The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, anaphylaxis, and rash from Lamictal.
- The patient was started on antibiotics (Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole) but all antibiotics were discontinued.
- The patient is receiving multiple infusions including Furosemide, Midazolam, and Fentanyl.
- The patient's temperature is elevated (Tmax: 38.3 C, Tcurrent: 38.1 C).
- The patient's blood pressure is within normal range (BP: 109/42 mmHg).
- The patient's heart rate is within normal range (HR: 68 bpm).
- The patient's respiratory rate is within normal range (RR: 12 insp/min).
- The patient's oxygen saturation is stable at 100% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.
- The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 56 mmHg, HCO3- of 103 mEq/L, and a base excess of -38 mEq/L.
- The patient's WBC count is elevated at 17.9 K/uL.
- The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly decreased at 9.7 g/dL.
- The patient's platelet count is within normal range at 247 K/uL.
- The patient's creatinine level is within normal range at 1.2 mg/dL.
- The patient has hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 143 mg/dL.
- The patient's other lab results show some abnormalities including elevated liver enzymes (AST: 32 U/L, ALT: 13 U/L), low albumin level (2.6 g/dL), elevated lactic acid level (3.0 mmol/L), and elevated LDH level (917 IU/L).
- The patient has been diagnosed with activity intolerance, ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin, community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure. If the underlying cause is not addressed, there is a risk of progression to chronic respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. If left untreated, this condition can worsen and lead to complications such as sepsis or lung abscess.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever indicates an underlying infection or inflammatory process. If the cause of the fever is not identified and treated, it can lead to further complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels put them at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state if not managed appropriately.
5. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently within normal range, the use of vasopressor medications may be necessary in the future. If hypotension occurs, it can compromise organ perfusion and lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and abnormal lab"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and an unknown origin fever. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 109/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's ABG results show a slightly alkalotic pH, normal PaCO2, elevated PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and normal ventilation rate.

The patient's physical examination reveals tracheostomy in place without surrounding erythema, diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi anteriorly in the lungs, normal heart sounds with a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, soft and non-distended abdomen, and sedated mental status with withdrawal to painful stimuli.

The patient's assessment includes activity intolerance, ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin, community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hyperglycemia, and ICU care for nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain
   was negative. Patient is ventilated on pressure support 10 over 12 of
   PEEP and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2
   currently at 50%, which has improved in last three days.
   - PEEP dependent on patient sedation.  Attempt to decrease PEEP slowly
   as patient tolerates
   - All abx discontinued as unclear source of treatment.  Monitor status
   off abx
   - f/u cultures
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Appreciate thoracic surgery recs, will need sutures out soon (7 days
   post-op will be Thurs. [**4-10**])
   - cont steroid prednisone 60mg today continue to taper down
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for
   days. Had fever to 101.5.  Has new blood and urine cultures pending.
   All blood cultures and urine cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff
   negative. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time.
   All abx discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of treatment and
   continued fevers despite adequate course and selection of empiric
   antibiotics.
   - Medication review for causes of pyrexia
   - Appreciate ongoing ID input, will cont abx, consider Upper ext.
   ultrasound for clot. Will hold off on CT torso as part of FUO workup
   due to patient
s tenuous status and tendency to desat with movement.
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - check LFTs, lipase, consider RUQ ultrasound if suspicious labs
   #Hypernatremia: at 148 today.
   - free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 4 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Increase glargine to 10 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   - discuss with pharmacy regarding mixing abx and other meds in NS
   rather than D5
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient continues to have persistent tachypnea and requires relatively high levels of oxygen.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, fever, hypernatremia, diabetes/hyperglycemia, and depression. She is receiving mechanical ventilation support and is sedated.

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to her poor pulmonary reserve caused by ILD and baseline abnormal lungs. It is also worsened by fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia). The patient is currently ventilated on pressure support 10 over 12 cmH2O of PEEP and has been tolerating it well, except for brief desaturations. FiO2 is currently at 50%.
   - Slowly decrease PEEP as the patient tolerates it.
   - Monitor for any changes in oxygen requirements.

2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for days. She had a fever of 101.5°F. All blood cultures and urine cultures are negative thus far. The patient's c. difficile test is negative"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Will use A-line and ABG for adjustment of vent
   settings. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample
   with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain
   was negative. Patient is ventilated on pressure support 10 over 12 of
   PEEP and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2
   currently at 50%, which has improved in last three days.
   - wean vent as tolerates to trach collar.
   - All abx discontinued as unclear source of treatment.  Monitor status
   off abx
   - f/u cultures
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - will contact thoracic surgery concerning trach sutures
   - d/c steroids today.
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for
   days. Had fever to 101.5.  Has new blood and urine cultures pending.
   All blood cultures and urine cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff
   negative. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time.
   LFT normal.  All abx discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of
   treatment and continued fevers despite adequate course and selection of
   empiric antibiotics.  Persistently elevated LDH likely from underlying
   lung disease.
   - Medication review for causes of pyrexia
   - BUE U/S r/o DVT as source of fever.
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - check LFTs, lipase, consider RUQ ultrasound if suspicious labs
   #Hypernatremia: at 148 today.
   - free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 4 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Increase glargine to 10 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   - discuss with pharmacy regarding mixing abx and other meds in NS
   rather than D5
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus type I. She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's baseline abnormal lungs due to ILD likely contribute to her poor pulmonary reserve. Her hypoxia is likely related to fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on top of poor baseline. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support and PEEP.

2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking with fevers overnight and previously for days. Despite adequate courses of empiric antibiotics, the fevers persist. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been negative thus far.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 148 today. Free water flushes in tube feeds are being administered every 4 hours.

4. Diabetes/hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes is being managed with an insulin drip and adjustment of glargine dosage.

5. Depression: The patient's home medications for depression are being continued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of decreased oxygen saturation. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy, anaphylaxis to Lamictal, and rash. She was previously taking prednisone but discontinued it. She has been on increased doses of Zyprexa but still requires large amounts of sedation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F, blood pressure ranging from 106/40-152/68 mmHg, heart rate between 68-94 bpm, respiratory rate between 8-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 752 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right arm, for which she is receiving heparin. She has been supratherapeutic overnight. The patient also has a fever, and no clear infection has been identified. An ultrasound was performed to rule out clots in her arms, and blood cultures were taken. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 8.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 143-125 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 3.0 mmol/L. Her renal function tests reveal an increased creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and her liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes. 

The patient's physical examination findings include a tracheostomy with no surrounding erythema, diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi anteriorly, and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. She is sedated, withdraws to painful stimuli, and does not respond to commands. 

The patient's assessment and plan include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, activity intolerance, ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin (FUO), pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hyperglycemia, and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory failure, pneumonia, and diffuse coarse crackles and rhonchi suggest potential pulmonary complications. These may include worsening respiratory distress, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Cardiovascular complications: The systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border could indicate a possible cardiac abnormality. This may lead to further cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Infection-related complications: The patient's fever of unknown origin (FUO), leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes suggest an ongoing infection. This may progress to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.

4. Thromboembolic complications: The presence of a DVT in the upper extremity increases the risk of further thromboembolic events such as a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's supratherapeutic heparin levels indicate the need for careful monitoring to prevent bleeding complications.

5. Hyperglycemic complications: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels put her at risk for hyperglycemic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being and prevent any further deterioration of her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Continuing adjustment of vent settings. Urine
   legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample with no growth.
   Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain was negative.
   Patient is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 10 of PEEP and has
   been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2 currently at 50%,
   which has improved in last three days.
   - wean vent as tolerates.
   - All abx discontinued as unclear source of treatment.  Monitor status
   off abx
   - f/u cultures
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - steroids off as of [**4-10**].
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   - increase PO sedation to 15mg valium TID and start methadone 10mg TID
   - attempt to wean drip sedation
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for
   days. Had fever to 101.5.  Has new blood and urine cultures pending.
   All blood cultures and urine cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff
   negative. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time.
   LFT normal.  All abx discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of
   treatment and continued fevers despite adequate course and selection of
   empiric antibiotics.  Persistently elevated LDH likely from underlying
   lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE DVT, heparin drip started, however not
   clear if this is source of fever.
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - pull PICC today (place new PICC/midline)
   # Alkalosis: Likely from diruesis
   - start Diamox 250mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 doses
   #Hypernatremia: at 148 today.
   - free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 4 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following. Discussed with pharmacy regarding mixing abx and
   other meds in NS rather than D5 (only Levaquin will remain in D5 as
   this is pre-mixed).
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Increased glargine to 10 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with persistent tachypnea and relatively high oxygen requirements.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention. These include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's current hypoxia is likely related to her underlying ILD/baseline abnormal lungs, fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on top of poor baseline. The patient is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 10 of PEEP and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2 currently at 50%, which has improved in the last three days.

2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for days. She had a fever to 101.5. All blood cultures and urine cultures are negative thus far. Is c. diff negative. The source of the fever is unclear, and other causes should be considered.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): A bilateral upper extremity ultrasound showed a DVT in the right arm. Heparin drip started, but it is not clear if this is the source of fever.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ILD (Interstitital Lung Disease) and diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) due to cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She presented with persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements. The patient has been intubated and tracheostomized, and her current condition is stable with some brief desaturations. She is ventilated on pressure support over 12 of PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure). FiO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen) is currently at 50%, which has improved in the last three days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs suggests poor pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia is likely related to her fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on top of poor baseline lung function. This condition requires careful monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings.

2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking with fever overnight and previously for days. Despite adequate courses of empiric antibiotics, her fever persists. All blood cultures and urine cultures are negative thus far. The source of fever remains unclear, and other causes should be considered.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 148 today. Free water flush"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has had multiple medical complications including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), activity intolerance, ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin (FUO), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hyperglycemia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been monitored closely with various vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). If not appropriately treated, the infection can worsen, leading to sepsis and septic shock.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a DVT in her upper extremity. If left untreated, it can potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation. If the ventilator settings are not adjusted correctly or if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), it can further compromise the patient's respiratory status.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fevers indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying condition. Identifying the source of the fever is crucial to prevent it from progressing to a more severe infection.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Continuing adjustment of vent settings. Urine
   legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample with no growth.
   Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain was negative.
   Patient is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 10 of PEEP and has
   been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2 currently at 50%,
   which has improved in last three days.
   - wean vent as tolerates.
   - All abx discontinued as unclear source of treatment.  Monitor status
   off abx
   - f/u cultures
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - will contact thoracic surgery concerning trach sutures
   - steroids off as of [**4-10**].
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for
   days. Had fever to 101.5.  Has new blood and urine cultures pending.
   All blood cultures and urine cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff
   negative. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time.
   LFT normal.  All abx discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of
   treatment and continued fevers despite adequate course and selection of
   empiric antibiotics.  Persistently elevated LDH likely from underlying
   lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE DVT, heparin drip started, however not
   clear if this is source of fever.
   - Medication review for causes of pyrexia
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - pull PICC today (place new PICC/midline)
   #Hypernatremia: at 148 today.
   - free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 4 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following. Discussed with pharmacy regarding mixing abx and
   other meds in NS rather than D5 (only Levaquin will remain in D5 as
   this is pre-mixed).
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Increased glargine to 10 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. Since admission, she has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has ongoing hypoxia due to her history of ILD and baseline abnormal lungs. This is further exacerbated by fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on top of poor baseline lung function. She is currently ventilated on pressure support 8 over 10 of PEEP and has shown improvement in the last three days.

2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking with fevers overnight and previously for days. Despite adequate courses of empiric antibiotics, the fevers continue. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and other potential causes of fever are being considered.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 148 today. Free water flushes in tube feeds are being given every 4 hours to address this issue.

4. Diabetes/Hyperglycemia: The patient's glycemic control has improved on an insulin drip. Adjustments to her diabetes medication regimen are being made, and she is being monitored closely for any signs of diabetic ketoacid"

   Stopped steroids as no evidence  of benefit.
   sedation:  increased zyprexa.  Will start methadone and go up on valium
   and try wean down on the drips
   fevers:  continued fevers, no clear source.
   RUE DVT:  Could be cause for fever.  Will ask IV team to switch out PIC
   line - will need to hold heparin
   hypernatremia:  free water flush
   alkalosis:  likely due to contraction.  Will give diamox to reduce
   metabolic alkalosis
   DM I:  on glargine and insulin

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Continuing adjustment of vent settings. Urine
   legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample with no growth.
   Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain was negative.
   Patient is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 10 of PEEP and has
   been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2 currently at 50%,
   which has improved in last three days.
   - wean vent as tolerates.
   - All abx discontinued as unclear source of treatment.  Monitor status
   off abx
   - f/u cultures
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - steroids off as of [**4-10**].
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   - increase PO sedation to 15mg valium TID and start methadone 10mg TID
   - attempt to wean drip sedation
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for
   days. Had fever to 101.5.  Has new blood and urine cultures pending.
   All blood cultures and urine cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff
   negative. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time.
   LFT normal.  All abx discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of
   treatment and continued fevers despite adequate course and selection of
   empiric antibiotics.  Persistently elevated LDH likely from underlying
   lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE DVT, heparin drip started, however not
   clear if this is source of fever.
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - pull PICC today (place new PICC/midline)
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
   # Alkalosis: Likely from diruesis
   - start Diamox 250mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 doses
   #Hypernatremia: at 148 today.
   - free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 4 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following. Discussed with pharmacy regarding mixing abx and
   other meds in NS rather than D5 (only Levaquin will remain in D5 as
   this is pre-mixed).
   - Cont insulin drip
   - Increased glargine to 10 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient had persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements, leading to intubation and tracheostomy. She is currently ventilated on pressure support mode with PEEP set at 8 cmH2O and FiO2 at 50%. 

The patient has been experiencing intermittent spikes in fever, with a maximum temperature of 102.6°F (2209). Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending, with all previous blood cultures being negative. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 18.2 K/uL, and she has an elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. 

The patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which was detected through a bilateral upper extremity ultrasound. She is receiving heparin therapy for the DVT. 

Her electrolytes show hypernatremia with a sodium level of 148 mEq/L. 

The patient's diabetes is under control with an insulin drip and glargine. She is also receiving Ensure nutrition through a feeding tube.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and shortness of breath. They have a history of allergies to penicillins, anaphylaxis, and rash from Lamictal. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics since admission, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. They are currently on various infusions such as heparin sodium, midazolam, furosemide, and insulin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.6°F, blood pressure ranging from 93/37-125/47 mmHg, heart rate of 60-73 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 721 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system is stable with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 156 and an ABG showing pH 7.44, PaCO2 53, and HCO3- 77.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.2-19.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 255-256 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL, glucose level of 82-135 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including high sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels. The patient's albumin level is 2.6 g/dL, lactic acid level is 1.1 mmol/L, and LDH level is 917 IU/L.

The patient has several medical complications including hypernatremia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), activity intolerance, ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin (FUO), pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and possible sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypernatremia: Correct sodium imbalance with careful fluid management.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper extremity: Anticoagulate with heparin and consider pharmacomechanical thrombosis (PMT) for clot removal.
3. Activity intolerance: Gradually increase mobility and encourage early ambulation.
4. Ineffective coping: Provide emotional support and involve family members in decision-making.
5. Fever, unknown origin (FUO): Investigate potential sources of infection and treat accordingly.
6. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): Administer appropriate antibiotics based on culture results.
7. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Provide ventilatory support as needed.
8. Hyperglycemia: Monitor blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Continuing adjustment of vent settings. Urine
   legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample with no growth.
   Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain was negative.
   Patient is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 10 of PEEP and has
   been tolerating aside from brief desaturations. FiO2 currently at 50%,
   which has improved in last three days.
   - wean vent as tolerates.
   - All abx discontinued as unclear source of treatment.  Monitor status
   off abx
   - f/u cultures
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - steroids off as of [**4-10**].
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   - increase PO sedation to 15mg valium TID and start methadone 10mg TID
   - attempt to wean drip sedation
   # Fever:
   Patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for
   days. Had fever to 102.6 last night. All blood cultures and urine
   cultures negative thus far. Is c. diff negative. Will start to consider
   other causes of fever at this time. LFTs normal.  All abx discontinued
   on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of treatment and continued fevers despite
   adequate course and selection of empiric antibiotics.  Persistently
   elevated LDH likely from underlying lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE
   DVT, heparin drip started, however not clear if this is source of
   fever.
   - Follow-up pending blood and urine cultures.
   - Pull PICC today (place new PICC/midline)
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
   - Heparin drip
   - Discontinue PICC line on right and place new line on left
   # Alkalosis: Likely from diruesis
   - Diamox 250mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 doses ending on night of [**4-12**]
   #Hypernatremia: at 139 today.
   - Decrease free water flushes in tube feeds at 150 mL every 6 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   No current evidence of DKA. Improved glycemic control on insulin drip
   with [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Discontinue insulin drip
   - Increase glargine to 25 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ILD and diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the MICU with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on CXR. She has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, fever, upper extremity DVT, alkalosis, hypernatremia, diabetes/hyperglycemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's baseline abnormal lungs and history of ILD may contribute to her poor pulmonary reserve. Her hypoxia could be related to her fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production due to community-acquired pneumonia. Acute worsening respiratory status has required intubation and tracheostomy. Ventilator settings need to be adjusted accordingly.
2. Fever: The patient has been intermittently spiking overnight and previously for days. Blood cultures and urine cultures are negative, but c. diff status is not mentioned. Other causes of fever should be considered, especially since all antibiotics were discontinued due to unclear source of treatment and continued fevers despite adequate courses of empiric antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Continuing adjustment of vent settings. Urine
   legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample with no growth.
   Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain was negative.
   Patient is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 8 of PEEP and has been
   tolerating aside from brief desaturations in periods of agitation. FiO2
   currently at 50% unless agitated, then need for higher FiO2.
   - Liberate from vent as tolerates.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Steroids off as of [**4-10**].
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   - Continue PO sedation valium 15mg TID and methadone 10mg TID
   - Attempt to liberate from drip sedation
   # Mental status:
   Patient with unknown underlying mental status as sedation wean is
   limited by desaturations. Had concerning time period of hypoxia
   surrounding her intubation.
   - Head CT today or tomorrow when stable enough for travel to assess
   # Fever:
   Patient has been spiking overnight and previously for days. Had fever
   to 102.6 last night. All blood cultures and urine cultures negative
   thus far. Is c. diff negative for 3 samples. Will start to consider
   other causes of fever at this time. LFTs normal.  All abx discontinued
   on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of treatment and continued fevers despite
   adequate course and selection of empiric antibiotics.  Persistently
   elevated LDH likely from underlying lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE
   DVT, heparin drip started, however not clear if this is source of
   fever.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Pull PICC today (place new PICC/midline)
   - CT sinuses and abdomen today or tomorrow when stable enough for
   travel to assess for possible nidus of infection that has been
   previously missed
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
   - Heparin drip
   - Discontinue PICC line on right and place new line on left
   # Alkalosis:
   Likely from diuresis. Bicarb has decreased to 33 today on chem panel.
   - Diamox 250mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 doses ending on night of [**4-12**]
   #Hypernatremia:
   At 139 today.
   - Decrease free water flushes in tube feeds at 150 mL every 6 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   Decreased need for insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Discontinue insulin drip
   - Increase glargine to 25 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been experiencing persistent tachypnea and relatively high oxygen requirements.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has poor pulmonary reserve due to ILD and baseline abnormal lungs. Her current hypoxia is likely related to fevers, leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on top of her poor baseline. The patient is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 8 of PEEP and tolerating aside from brief desaturations in periods of agitation. FiO2 is currently at 50% unless agitated, then higher FiO2 may be needed.

2. Mental status: The patient's mental status is unknown as sedation wean is limited by desaturations. There was a concerning time period of hypoxia surrounding her intubation.

3. Fever: The patient has been spiking overnight and previously for days. All blood cultures and urine cultures are negative thus far. Clostridium difficile toxin A & B test has been negative for three samples. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time. Liver function tests (L"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of PNA (Pneumonia) and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) in the setting of underlying ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease). 

The patient has been sedated and unresponsive, unable to provide history. They have a history of allergies to penicillins and lamictal, resulting in anaphylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 39.2 C (102.6 F) to 36.5 C (97.7 F), heart rate between 65 and 73 bpm, blood pressure varying between 83/40 mmHg and 125/47 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10 and 17 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation at 98%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows fluctuations in blood pressure and fluid balance. They have received a total of 2,947 mL of fluids, with 1,320 mL of transfused fluids and 797 mL of intravenous fluids. The patient has also received a total of 2,400 mL of blood products and 2,160 mL of urine output.

The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube, ventilator mode set to CPAP/PSV, tidal volume (Vt) between 718 mL and 804 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ranging"

The patient is a sedated and unresponsive individual in the ICU with hypoxia as the chief complaint. The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of agitation, desaturation, and high blood pressure. They were unable to undergo a CT scan due to unstable blood pressure and oxygen saturation. The patient has been on increased doses of sedation, with episodes of bradycardia and ventricular escape during agitation. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation, but this did not affect the number of agitation episodes. The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate, fluctuating blood pressure, respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds, no wheezes, and no signs of erythema at the PICC site. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and lactate levels. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some values within the normal range. The patient's assessment and plan include various medical interventions and prophylactic measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's low oxygen saturation and coarse breath sounds may indicate the possibility of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure and high systolic readings during agitation could suggest the potential for hypertensive crisis or cardiac arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Her current hypoxia likely tied to her fevers,
   leukocytosis, and sputum production (community-acquired pneumonia) on
   top of poor baseline. Now acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Continuing adjustment of vent settings. Urine
   legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL sample with no growth.
   Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP stain was negative.
   Patient is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 8 of PEEP and has been
   tolerating aside from brief desaturations in periods of agitation. FiO2
   currently at 50% unless agitated, then need for higher FiO2.
   - Liberate from vent as tolerates.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Steroids off as of [**4-10**].
   - Fluid balance -500cc - 1L
   - Continue PO sedation valium 15mg TID and methadone 10mg TID
   - Attempt to liberate from drip sedation
   # Mental status:
   Patient with unknown underlying mental status as sedation wean is
   limited by desaturations. Had concerning time period of hypoxia
   surrounding her intubation.
   - Head CT today or tomorrow when stable enough for travel to assess
   # Fever:
   Patient has been spiking overnight and previously for days. Had fever
   to 102.6 last night. All blood cultures and urine cultures negative
   thus far. Is c. diff negative for 3 samples. Will start to consider
   other causes of fever at this time. LFTs normal.  All abx discontinued
   on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of treatment and continued fevers despite
   adequate course and selection of empiric antibiotics.  Persistently
   elevated LDH likely from underlying lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE
   DVT, heparin drip started, however not clear if this is source of
   fever.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Pull PICC today (place new PICC/midline)
   - CT sinuses and abdomen today or tomorrow when stable enough for
   travel to assess for possible nidus of infection that has been
   previously missed
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
   - Heparin drip
   - Discontinue PICC line on right and place new line on left
   # Alkalosis:
   Likely from diuresis. Bicarb has decreased to 33 today on chem panel.
   - Diamox 250mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 doses ending on night of [**4-12**]
   #Hypernatremia:
   At 139 today.
   - Decrease free water flushes in tube feeds at 150 mL every 6 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   Decreased need for insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Discontinue insulin drip
   - Increase glargine to 25 units twice daily
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I) who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She is currently sedated and intubated, requiring mechanical ventilation due to persistent tachypnea and high oxygen requirements. 

The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, likely due to her underlying ILD and baseline abnormal lungs, as well as community-acquired pneumonia. She is ventilated on pressure support 8 over 8 of PEEP and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations during periods of agitation. FiO2 is currently at 50% unless agitated, then higher FiO2 is needed.

The patient's mental status is unknown as sedation weaning is limited by desaturations. There have been concerning periods of hypoxia surrounding her intubation. A head CT is planned when she is stable enough for travel to assess her underlying mental status.

The patient has been spiking with fever overnight and previously, with a high of 102.6 last night. All blood cultures and urine cultures are negative thus far. Is c. diff negative for 3 samples.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Had acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Finished antibiotic course of vnacomycin and
   levofloxacin. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL
   sample with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP
   stain was negative. Steroid burst for 6 days was discontinued on
   [**2200-4-10**]. Patient is ventilated on pressure support 12 over 8 of PEEP
   and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations in periods of
   agitation. FiO2 currently at 50% unless agitated, then need for higher
   FiO2. Patient has begun having more frequent periods of agitation,
   which are newly associated with hypertension and bradycardia. The
   bradycardia has been severe enough to elicit a ventricular escape
   rhythm. Concern that bradycardia and hypertension may be related to
   increased ICH; however, exam does not corroborate at this time. Will
   remove methadone, as it is a new medication that was started around
   same time as beginning of bradycardic episodes. Has fortunately not
   been hypotensive during bradycardia.
   - Discontinue methadone due to concerns for bradycardia and start
   fentanyl patch
   - Continue PO sedation valium 15mg TID
   - Continue olanzapine 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt to liberate from drip sedation as episodes of hypertension
   and desats may be unrelated to sedation.
   - Attempt to correlate frequency of episodes with amount of sedation
   - Liberate from vent as tolerates.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Fluid balance goal of  -500cc - 1L
   # Mental status:
   Patient with unknown underlying mental status as sedation wean is
   limited by desaturations. Had concerning time period of hypoxia
   surrounding her intubation.
   - Head CT this AM
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours. Patient had been spiking fevers daily
   [**Last Name (un) 3538**] on [**2200-4-1**]. Last fever was on [**4-11**] at 1600.  Has 9 negative
   blood cultures this admission with two blood cultures pending and
   negative. All urine cultures negative. Is c. diff negative for 3
   samples. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time.
   LFTs normal.  All abx discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of
   treatment and continued fevers despite adequate course and selection of
   empiric antibiotics.  Persistently elevated LDH likely from underlying
   lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE DVT, heparin drip started, however not
   clear if this is source of fever. Attempt at CT of sinuses and abdomen
   yesterday foiled by combination of no IV access and labile blood
   pressures.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - CT sinuses today.
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
 Right PICC has
   been discontinued.
   - Heparin drip
   # Alkalosis:
   Has resolved to HCO3 of 26 (down from peak of 41).
   - Discontinue acetazolamide
   #Hypernatremia:
   At 136 today.
   - Decrease free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 6 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   Decreased need for insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Copntinue glargine to 25 units twice daily, titrate up sliding scale
   as needed
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Had acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Finished antibiotic course of vnacomycin and
   levofloxacin. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL
   sample with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP
   stain was negative. Steroid burst for 6 days was discontinued on
   [**2200-4-10**]. Patient is ventilated on pressure support 12 over 8 of PEEP
   and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations in periods of
   agitation. FiO2 currently at 50% unless agitated, then need for higher
   FiO2. Patient has begun having more frequent periods of agitation,
   which are newly associated with hypertension and bradycardia. The
   bradycardia has been severe enough to elicit a ventricular escape
   rhythm. Concern that bradycardia and hypertension may be related to
   increased ICH; however, exam does not corroborate at this time. Will
   remove methadone, as it is a new medication that was started around
   same time as beginning of bradycardic episodes. Has fortunately not
   been hypotensive during bradycardia.
   - Discontinue methadone due to concerns for bradycardia and start
   fentanyl patch
   - Continue PO sedation valium 15mg TID
   - Continue olanzapine 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt to liberate from drip sedation as episodes of hypertension
   and desats may be unrelated to sedation.
   - Attempt to correlate frequency of episodes with amount of sedation
   - Liberate from vent as tolerates.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Fluid balance goal of  -500cc - 1L
   # Mental status:
   Patient with unknown underlying mental status as sedation wean is
   limited by desaturations. Had concerning time period of hypoxia
   surrounding her intubation.
   - Head CT this AM
   # Fever:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours. Patient had been spiking fevers daily
   [**Last Name (un) 3538**] on [**2200-4-1**]. Last fever was on [**4-11**] at 1600.  Has 9 negative
   blood cultures this admission with two blood cultures pending and
   negative. All urine cultures negative. Is c. diff negative for 3
   samples. Will start to consider other causes of fever at this time.
   LFTs normal.  All abx discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of
   treatment and continued fevers despite adequate course and selection of
   empiric antibiotics.  Persistently elevated LDH likely from underlying
   lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE DVT, heparin drip started, however not
   clear if this is source of fever. Attempt at CT of sinuses and abdomen
   yesterday foiled by combination of no IV access and labile blood
   pressures.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - CT sinuses today.
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
 Right PICC has
   been discontinued.
   - Heparin drip
   # Alkalosis:
   Has resolved to HCO3 of 26 (down from peak of 41).
   - Discontinue acetazolamide
   #Hypernatremia:
   At 136 today.
   - Decrease free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 6 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   Decreased need for insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Copntinue glargine to 25 units twice daily, titrate up sliding scale
   as needed
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She required intubation and tracheostomy due to worsening respiratory status. The patient finished an antibiotic course of vancomycin and levofloxacin. Urine legionella antigen is negative, and sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples show no growth. Rapid viral antigens are negative, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) stain was negative. The patient underwent a steroid burst for 6 days, which was discontinued on [**2200-4-10**]. She is currently ventilated on pressure support 12 over 8 of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and has been tolerating well, aside from brief desaturations during periods of agitation. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is currently at 50%, unless agitated, in which case a higher FiO2 is required. The patient has begun experiencing more frequent episodes of agitation, which are newly associated with hypertension and bradycardia. The bradycardia has been severe enough to elicit a ventricular escape rhythm. There is concern that the bradycardia and hypertension may be related"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxia. They have episodes of desaturation to 90% with apparent agitation, which resolve spontaneously. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins and rash with lamotrigine. They are currently receiving heparin sodium, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions. The patient's fever has been fluctuating, and they have experienced hypotension that responded well to a 500cc bolus. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/50 to 184/136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for episodes of hypoxia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are consistently below normal, indicating a potential respiratory failure. 
2. Pneumonia: The presence of coarse breath sounds and the preliminary findings of acute sinusitis suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's elevated white blood cell count and symptoms may indicate the development of a DVT, particularly considering the immobility in the ICU.
4. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine and blood urea"

   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU is experiencing hypoxia, with episodes of desaturation to 90% that resolve spontaneously. They also have sinusitis, as indicated by the preliminary read of their sinus CT scan. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins and rash with Lamictal (Lamotrigine). They are currently on infusions of Heparin Sodium, Fentanyl, and Midazolam (Versed). 

The patient's fever reached 100.7 degrees Celsius, and they were pan-cultured. They have been experiencing episodes of hypotension, requiring three boluses of 500cc with good results. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), blood pressure ranging from 75/50 to 127/50 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to hemodynamic instability. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 19.1 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 28.1%, and normal platelet count (Plt) at 130 K/uL. Other lab values indicate potential renal failure, hypernatremia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), activity intolerance, ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin, pneumonia, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and others. 

The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) line and an arterial line in place. They are receiving Ensure nutrition at a rate of 35 mL/hour and have been given prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unclear based on the provided information."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of PNA (Pneumonia), ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease), and encephalopathy, potentially due to anoxic injury. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/44 to 196/136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is described as sedated, with no attention, not following simple commands, and not assessed for movement, tone, or other neurological functions.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to PNA with subsequent ARDS in the setting of underlying ILD. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and requires increased FiO2 after an episode of agitation.
2. Sedation: The patient is sedated, causing agitation at times, leading to the administration of bolus/increased sedating medications. Methadone has been discontinued due to causing bradycardia, and a fentanyl patch has been started instead.
3. Fevers: The patient is afebrile for the past 24 hours, with possible medical-related fevers or sinusitis. Sinusitis is evident on"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Had acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Finished antibiotic course of vancomycin and
   levofloxacin. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL
   sample with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP
   stain was negative. Steroid burst for 6 days was discontinued on
   [**2200-4-10**]. FiO2 was weaned down to 50% but is now increased to 90%.
   Patient began having more frequent periods of agitation, which were
   newly associated with hypertension and bradycardia overnight on
   [**2200-4-12**]. The bradycardia was severe enough to elicit a ventricular
   escape rhythm.  We discontinued methadone, as it is a new medication
   that was started around same time as beginning of bradycardic episodes.
   Has fortunately not been hypotensive during bradycardia. Assist control
   was switched to pressure support 15 and 12 of PEEP and has having
   episodes of becoming dysynchronous from the vent associated with
   decreased sedation levels. Overnight sedation level was significantly
   increased.
   - Continue PO sedation valium 15 mg TID
   - Continue olanzapine 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Sedation increased as difficulty ventilating overnight, wean as
   tolerated
   - Increased vent settings o/n- will liberate from vent as tolerated
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   # Hypotension: Overnight episodes of hypotension after increasing
   sedation for respiratory status. Unresponsive to fluid bolus. Improved
   slightly with weaning of sedation, however not tolerating decreased
   sedation from a respiratory standpoint.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Phenylephrine as needed for pressure support
   # Mental status:
   Patient with unknown underlying mental status as sedation wean is
   limited by desaturations. Had concerning time period of hypoxia
   surrounding her intubation. Head CT prelim without pathology.
   - Follow-up final head CT read
   - Consider neurology consult if patient remains unresponsive as
   sedation further lightened
   # Fever:
   Continues to spike fevers nightly with no source identified.  No source
   identified. Not currently on antibiotics, completed course of abx
   earlier in hospital course, Has 9 negative blood cultures this
   admission with two blood cultures pending and negative. All urine
   cultures negative. Is c. diff negative for 3 samples. Will start to
   consider other causes of fever at this time. LFTs normal.  All abx
   discontinued on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of treatment and continued
   fevers despite adequate course and selection of empiric antibiotics.
   Persistently elevated LDH likely from underlying lung disease.  BUE U/S
   shows RUE DVT, heparin drip started, however not clear if this is
   source of fever. CT sinuses shows ? sinusitis. NGT discontinued
   secondary to sinusitis.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - NGT discontinued and switched to OGT
   - Saline nasal rinse
   # High tube feed residuals:
   In last two days has had tube feeds stopped due to high residuals.
   - Initiate metoclopramide 10 mg QID and restart tube feeds after dosing
   # Anemia:
   HCT drop from 28.4 yesterday to 23.3 today. NG aspirate negative for
   occult blood. Concern due to heparin drip being restarted.
   - Check stool guaiac
   - Evening HCT check
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
 Right PICC has
   been discontinued.
   -Has been on heparin drip, platelets now trending down, will d/c
   heparin drip.
   # Alkalosis:
   Has resolved to HCO3 of 23 (down from peak of 41).
   - Discontinue acetazolamide
   #Hypernatremia:
   At 139 today.
   - Maintain free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 6 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   Decreased need for insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Copntinue glargine to 25 units twice daily, titrate up sliding scale
   as needed
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient required intubation and tracheostomy due to worsening respiratory status. She finished her antibiotic course of vancomycin and levofloxacin, but urine and sputum cultures were negative for Legionella, and rapid viral antigens were also negative. The patient received a steroid burst for 6 days, which was discontinued on [**2200-4-10**]. FiO2 was weaned down to 50% but increased to 90% recently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has poor pulmonary reserve due to ILD/baseline abnormal lungs and requires high levels of FiO2 to maintain oxygenation.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension after increasing sedation for respiratory status, which were unresponsive to fluid bolus. Phenylephrine is being used as needed for pressure support.
3. Mental status: The patient's underlying mental status is unknown, and sedation weaning is limited by desaturations. A head CT was performed without pathology, and a follow-up final head CT read is pending. If the patient remains unresponsive as sedation further lightens, a"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Had acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Finished antibiotic course of vancomycin and
   levofloxacin. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL
   sample with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP
   stain was negative. Steroid burst for 6 days was discontinued on
   [**2200-4-10**]. Patient is ventilated on pressure support 12 over 8 of PEEP
   and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations in periods of
   agitation. FiO2 currently at 50% unless agitated, then need for higher
   FiO2. Patient began having more frequent periods of agitation, which
   were newly associated with hypertension and bradycardia overnight on
   [**2200-4-12**]. The bradycardia was severe enough to elicit a ventricular
   escape rhythm. We discontinued methadone, as it is a new medication
   that was started around same time as beginning of bradycardic episodes.
   Has fortunately not been hypotensive during bradycardia.
   - Continue PO sedation valium 15 mg TID
   - Continue olanzapine 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue attempt to liberate from drip sedation as episodes of
   hypertension and desats may be unrelated to sedation.
   - Attempt to correlate frequency of episodes of desats with amount of
   sedation
   - Liberate from vent as tolerates.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   # Mental status:
   Patient with unknown underlying mental status as sedation wean is
   limited by desaturations. Had concerning time period of hypoxia
   surrounding her intubation. Head CT prelim without pathology.
   - Follow-up final head CT read
   - Consider neurology consult if patient remains unresponsive as
   sedation further lightened
   # Fever:
   Spiked again last night.  Has 9 negative blood cultures this admission
   with two blood cultures pending and negative. All urine cultures
   negative. Is c. diff negative for 3 samples. Will start to consider
   other causes of fever at this time. LFTs normal.  All abx discontinued
   on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of treatment and continued fevers despite
   adequate course and selection of empiric antibiotics.  Persistently
   elevated LDH likely from underlying lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE
   DVT, heparin drip started, however not clear if this is source of
   fever. CT sinuses prelim consistent with acute sinusitis.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Follow-up final CT sinus read and move NG tube to opposite nostril if
   sinusitis isolated to side of NG tube, otherwise, remove NG and place
   OG tube
   - Saline nasal rinse
   # High tube feed residuals:
   In last two days has had tube feeds stopped due to high residuals.
   - Initiate metoclopramide 10 mg QID and restart tube feeds after dosing
   # Anemia:
   HCT drop from 28.4 yesterday to 23.3 today. NG aspirate negative for
   occult blood. Concern due to heparin drip being restarted.
   - Check stool guaiac
   - Evening HCT check
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
 Right PICC has
   been discontinued.
   - Heparin drip
   # Alkalosis:
   Has resolved to HCO3 of 26 (down from peak of 41).
   - Discontinue acetazolamide
   #Hypernatremia:
   At 137 today.
   - Maintain free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 6 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   Decreased need for insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Copntinue glargine to 25 units twice daily, titrate up sliding scale
   as needed
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and diabetes mellitus (DM I). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. She required intubation and tracheostomy due to worsening respiratory status. She completed a course of antibiotics (vancomycin and levofloxacin) and had negative urine Legionella antigen, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures. Rapid viral antigens were also negative, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) stain was negative. A steroid burst was given but discontinued on 04/10/2022. The patient is currently ventilated on pressure support 12 over 8 of PEEP and tolerating well, except for brief desaturations during periods of agitation. FiO2 is currently at 50% unless agitated, requiring higher FiO2. The patient has experienced frequent periods of agitation associated with hypertension and bradycardia overnight on 04/12/2022. Methadone was discontinued as it was a new medication started around the same time as the beginning of bradycardic episodes. The patient has not been hypotensive during bradycardia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is experiencing several medical complications. These include hypotension (not in shock), acute renal failure, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, activity intolerance, ineffective coping, fever of unknown origin, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hyperglycemia, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 63/29 mmHg to 112/41 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving pressure support of 15, increased PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 90%, and other medications such as midazolam, heparin, phenylephrine, and fentanyl.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including high sodium, low potassium, and low magnesium.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,486 mL and output of 1,762 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support indicates the need for mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with ILD, DM I; admit with cough, dyspnea and
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR, to MICU with persistent tachypnea and
   relatively high oxygen requirements.
   # Hypoxia:
   With history of ILD/baseline abnormal lungs she likely has poor
   pulmonary reserve. Had acutely worsened respiratory status requiring
   intubation and trach. Finished antibiotic course of vancomycin and
   levofloxacin. Urine legionella antigen is negative. Sputum and BAL
   sample with no growth. Had rapid viral antigens return as negative. PCP
   stain was negative. Steroid burst for 6 days was discontinued on
   [**2200-4-10**]. Patient is ventilated on pressure support 12 over 8 of PEEP
   and has been tolerating aside from brief desaturations in periods of
   agitation. FiO2 currently at 50% unless agitated, then need for higher
   FiO2. Patient began having more frequent periods of agitation, which
   were newly associated with hypertension and bradycardia overnight on
   [**2200-4-12**]. The bradycardia was severe enough to elicit a ventricular
   escape rhythm. We discontinued methadone, as it is a new medication
   that was started around same time as beginning of bradycardic episodes.
   Has fortunately not been hypotensive during bradycardia.
   - Continue PO sedation valium 15 mg TID
   - Continue olanzapine 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Sedation increased as difficulty ventilating overnight, wean as
   tolerated
   - Increased vent settings o/n- will liberate from vent as tolerated
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   # Hypotension: Overnight episodes of hypotension after increasing
   sedation for respiratory status. Unresponsive to fluid bolus. Improved
   slightly with weaning of sedation, however not tolerating decreased
   sedation from a respiratory standpoint.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Phenylephrine as needed for pressure support
   # Mental status:
   Patient with unknown underlying mental status as sedation wean is
   limited by desaturations. Had concerning time period of hypoxia
   surrounding her intubation. Head CT prelim without pathology.
   - Follow-up final head CT read
   - Consider neurology consult if patient remains unresponsive as
   sedation further lightened
   # Fever:
   Spiked again last night.  Has 9 negative blood cultures this admission
   with two blood cultures pending and negative. All urine cultures
   negative. Is c. diff negative for 3 samples. Will start to consider
   other causes of fever at this time. LFTs normal.  All abx discontinued
   on [**4-9**] due to unclear source of treatment and continued fevers despite
   adequate course and selection of empiric antibiotics.  Persistently
   elevated LDH likely from underlying lung disease.  BUE U/S shows RUE
   DVT, heparin drip started, however not clear if this is source of
   fever. CT sinuses prelim consistent with acute sinusitis.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Follow-up final CT sinus read and move NG tube to opposite nostril if
   sinusitis isolated to side of NG tube, otherwise, remove NG and place
   OG tube
   - Saline nasal rinse
   # High tube feed residuals:
   In last two days has had tube feeds stopped due to high residuals.
   - Initiate metoclopramide 10 mg QID and restart tube feeds after dosing
   # Anemia:
   HCT drop from 28.4 yesterday to 23.3 today. NG aspirate negative for
   occult blood. Concern due to heparin drip being restarted.
   - Check stool guaiac
   - Evening HCT check
   # Upper extremity DVT:
Nonocclusive thrombus in the right basilic vein extending through the
   right axillary vein and into the right subclavian vein.
 Right PICC has
   been discontinued.
   - Heparin drip
   # Alkalosis:
   Has resolved to HCO3 of 26 (down from peak of 41).
   - Discontinue acetazolamide
   #Hypernatremia:
   At 137 today.
   - Maintain free water flushes in tube feeds at 100 mL every 6 hours
   # Diabetes/hyperglycemia:
   Decreased need for insulin drip. [**Last Name (un) 72**] following.
   - Copntinue glargine to 25 units twice daily, titrate up sliding scale
   as needed
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Depression:
   - Continue home meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ILD and DM I who was admitted to the MICU with cough, dyspnea, and evidence of pneumonia on CXR. She required intubation and tracheostomy due to worsening respiratory status. She has completed her antibiotic course but still requires ventilatory support. The patient has had episodes of agitation, hypertension, and bradycardia, which were associated with increased sedation. She also experienced episodes of hypotension that were unresponsive to fluid bolus. The patient has a fever despite negative blood cultures, and all antibiotics have been discontinued. She has a right upper extremity DVT and is on heparin drip. Other issues include anemia, high tube feed residuals, alkalosis, hypernatremia, diabetes/hyperglycemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on ventilatory support for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed right upper extremity DVT, which can lead to potential complications such as pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension that were unresponsive to fluid bolus, indicating possible inadequate blood pressure control.
4. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has persistent fevers despite negative blood cultures"

   Respiratory faiure:  hypoxemia much worse today.  Saturation in low 90s
   on 100% FiO2.   Overall although she had improved late last week, most
   recent worsening with very stiff lungs suggests that her chances of
   eventually getting off vent are very poor.  Will discuss with her
   partner but she had stated that likely she would not want aggressive
   care if she was unlikely to come off of vent.
   Fevers:  Continued fevers without source.

   Had discussion with patient
s HCP [**Name (NI) 2668**] [**Name (NI) 334**].  Explained to her that
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5897**] has become significantly worse since this past Friday,
   requiring increasing oxygen, increasing vent support , and increased
   levels of sedation to keep her comfortable.  There is a good likelihood
   that this was not just a PNA, but a sudden worsening of her IPF c/w a
   flare or acute interstitial PNA.  It would be difficult to know for
   certain, but her chances of getting of the ventilator are very poor.
   [**Doctor First Name 5207**] said that she would like to discuss with patient
s siblings, but
   is comfortable having her be DNR from now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diabetes mellitus type 1, and pneumonia (PNA), who has been admitted to the ICU. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has difficulty with sedation, becoming agitated with lower sedation levels and hypertensive with increased sedation. She has been started on neosynephrine.

24-hour events include a fever of 101.9°F. The patient's allergies are to penicillins and lamictal, which causes anaphylaxis and rash respectively. She is currently on midazolam (versed) at 6 mg/hour, heparin sodium at 1,200 units/hour, and fentanyl at 100 mcg/hour.

Other medications include fluoxetine, levoxyl, topamax, folate, pravastatin, valproate, MVI, olanzapine, valium, fentanyl patch, and insulin.

Review of systems and vital signs remain unchanged from admission except for the noted fever and increased blood pressure.

Physical examination shows the patient to be well-nourished but dysynchronous with the ventilator. Crackles are heard in the chest, and the patient has trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination reveals that the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds randomly. Movement"
