   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Unclear etiology, but likely
   multifactorial.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of acute respiratory failure on
   background of chronic pulmonary failure.  Etiology of acute
   decompensation not obvious, but may include pneumonia.  No evidence for
   acute pulmoanry embolism.  Atalectasis contributing to oxygen
   requirement.  Underlying pulmonary HTN and ILD.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation.  [**Month (only) 8**] require drainage of pleural effusion to assist in
   lung reexpansion.  Adjust ventilator to maintain ABG pH 7.30-7.35, pO2
   >90%.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- exudative right pleural effusion by most recent
   diagnostic thoracentesis.  No obvious pneumonia, no evidence for
   empyema or complicated pleural effusion (doubt TB).  Concern for
   rheumatoid related process or malignancy.  Would favor complete
   drainage of effusions to allow trapped lung to reexpand --> IP/Thoracic
   Surgery consultation for right chest catheter placement, ?pleuroscopy.
   Await pending labs and cytology on pleural fluid.  Would favor repeat
   Chest CT if able to drain effusion completely.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES
 reportedly with underlying ILD (?rheumatoid
   lung), but concerned for superimposed process, including acute
   infection.  At risk for opportunistic infection (ex. Pneumocystis
   pneumonia in pt. receiving chronic corticosterods).  Plan bronchoscopy
   with BAL.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENSION
 likely attributable to sedation at time of intubation.
   Would check cardiac echo.  Monitor BP, Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   HYPONATREMIA -- improving.  Monitor serial Na+
   FLUIDS
 Suspect hypovolemia.  Plan continue net resussitation, gentle.
   RENAL FUNCTION
 preserved.  Monitor urine output, Bun, creatinine.
   TACHY-BRADY SyNDROME -- s/p pacemaker placement.  Native rate
   acceptable.
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
 severely debilitated.  Maintain usual
   medication, including taper
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with sedation in place. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and the etiology of this failure is unclear but likely multifactorial. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range, a heart rate within the normal range, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, no signs of poor nutrition, and no abnormal findings in the cardiovascular or neurological examinations. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, normal electrolyte levels, and normal kidney function. 

The patient has several medical conditions that need to be addressed, including respiratory failure, pleural effusions (exudative right pleural effusion), pulmonary infiltrates, hypotension, hyponatremia, renal function (preserved), tachy-brady syndrome (with a pacemaker placed), and rheumatoid arthritis. 

The assessment and plan include continuing mechanical ventilation, drainage of pleural effusions to assist in lung reexpansion, adjusting ventilator settings to maintain appropriate ABG values, and consulting with thoracic surgery for chest catheter placement and possible pleuroscopy. Additionally, a bronchoscopy with BAL"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently critically ill with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating that their breathing is being assisted by a machine. The patient's respiratory support is being provided through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator mode set at CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The vital signs show a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 120/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has a history of erythromycin allergy, shellfish allergy, and an unknown allergy to ciprofloxacin. They were given vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. 

The review of systems reveals no constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or weight loss. The cardiovascular system is unremarkable with no chest pain, palpitations, edema, or orthopnea. The gastrointestinal system is also unremarkable with no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. There are no genitourinary symptoms like dysuria or a need for dialysis. The musculoskeletal system shows no joint pain or myalgias. 

Physical examination findings include an overweight/obese appearance, no acute distress, and a normal-sized head. The extremities show bilateral lower extremity edema but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone with limited ROM in the extremities. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 193 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 28 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.2 mg/dL, glucose of 157 mg/dL, and sodium of 139 mEq/L. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has respiratory failure with an unclear etiology but likely multifactorial causes. There is mention of possible pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, and interstitial lung disease. The patient also has pleural effusions that are exudative and may require drainage to assist in lung re-expansion. Additionally, there are pulmonary infiltrates with concern for superimposed infection, and bronchoscopy with BAL is planned. 

Other issues mentioned include hypotension, likely due to sedation during intubation, hypovolemia, preserved renal function, tachy-brady syndrome with a pacemaker placed, and severe rheumatoid arthritis. 

Overall, the patient requires continued mechanical ventilation, drainage of pleural effusions, management of pulmonary infiltrates, and monitoring of various parameters such as blood pressure, urine output, and electrolyte levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   ?hypercapneic resp failure w/ exudative pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was electively
   intubated for concern of hypercapnea. Given pH readings were 7.39-7.41
   in the setting of pCO2 of 69 suspect that pt may have recently become a
   chronic CO2 retainer, either from OSA and Obesity Hypoventilation
   Syndrome. Barriers to extubation include possible central muscle
   weakness, pleural effusions. Pt has been on steroids chronically and on
   review with the family it appears her activity level has decompensated
   considerably. Pleural Effusion on prior CT scan also showed RML and RLL
   compression, likely reponsible for her initial dyspnea presentation.
   Will need to maximize lung capcity via effusion reduction.
   - f/u NIF
   - consult IP in the AM for possible pigtail placement in Rt pleural
   effusion
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - RSBI in AM
   ,
   ##. Pleural Effusion: Given the large size of the effusion as well as
   the resulting compression of the RLL and RML on CT scan I suspect that
   this may be the cause of her dyspnea on presentation. Pt underwent
   diagnostic tap at OSH which was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Pt's progression of dyspnea also correlates with slow
   accumulation of effusion. Ddx for exudative effusion include
   infectious, malignancy, auto-immune. Infectious on differential as it
   is most common cause of effusion though pt showed no leukocytosis,
   cough, sputum production on presentation. Pt is currently
   immunosuppressed on her chronic steroid dosing for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] at high risk
   for an infectious process. Will perform BAL in the AM to check for
   infectious process, start on Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage.
   Malignancy is also on differential, cytology is currently pending, tap
   appeared to be amber in colour. Rheum pleurisy is another consideration
   however would expect a low glc.  Now s/p BAL.
   - plan for CT guided [**Female First Name (un) **]/pigtail placement today
   - continue Zosyn/Vanc for empiric coverage
   - f/u sputum cx, cell count, fungal
   - will re-image CT chest following pigtail placement
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Bolus PRN.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion
   - consider TTE today to eval systolic function
   .
   ##. Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to be hyponatremic on admission to
   [**Location (un) 3**] with 123, corrected up to 133 with IVF. Resolved to 139 here
   with NS bolus overnight.
   - trend Na
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Pt was noted to be in A. fib with RVR
   peri-intubation. Unclear as to whether she her nodal agents were held
   in the setting of hypotension versus hypotension occuring in the
   setting of A. fib with RVR. Pt converted to sinus spontaneously when
   placed on her home regimen of digoxin at OSH. Pt currently in sinus
   rhythm, not anticoagulated given h.o. GI bleed.
   - will continue on ASA 325mg
   -currently paced at 60 with good rate control
   - will continue on digoxin, Diltiazem and Metoprolol
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - wean down to home regimen of Prednisone once pigtail is placed.
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.
   ##. UTI: Pt has +Urine Cx for Enterococcus, will continue on Zosyn and
   call lab in the AM for culture results.
   ##. FEN: Pt currently on TF Neutropulm with a goal of 40cc/hr. Will
   obtain Nutrition consult.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, tachy-brady syndrome post pacemaker placement, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She presented with dyspnea and was intubated for suspected hypercapneic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with an exudative pleural effusion, likely secondary to her underlying conditions such as malignancy, autoimmune disease, or infection. The effusion has resulted in compression of the right middle and lower lobes, leading to decreased lung capacity. She also has poor urine output and hyponatremia, which may be related to intravascular volume depletion. The patient's medical history includes gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, and chronic steroid use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to concerns of hypercapnea. This condition can progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pleural Effusion: The large size of the effusion is causing compression of the right middle and lower lobes, leading to decreased lung capacity. If not addressed, this can worsen respiratory function.
3. Poor Urine Output: The patient's low urine output suggests intravascular volume depletion. If not corrected, it can lead to further fluid imbalance and organ dysfunction.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels require close monitoring and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy due to secretions in the airway but was unable to place a pigtail catheter. A CT-guided pigtail drain placement is planned for tomorrow, with the possibility of VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) in the future. The patient's urine output remains low, and their urine osmolality is high, suggesting intravascular depletion. Fluctuating central venous pressure (CVP) has raised concerns about the validity of the readings, but a CVP of 6 in PM was recorded. The patient received 1L boluses of fluid three times, resulting in minimal urine output response (100-200cc per 1L). Marginal blood pressures overnight were in the 80-90s, with stable but borderline urine output. Repeat urine electrolytes were ordered in the morning to assess volume status. The patient has allergies to erythromycin base, shellfish, nausea/vomiting, and ciprofloxacin. They are currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Infusions of fentanyl and midazolam are being administered, along with other medications. The patient's medical and family history could not be obtained. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   ?hypercapneic resp failure w/ exudative pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was electively
   intubated for concern of hypercapnea. Given pH readings were 7.39-7.41
   in the setting of pCO2 of 69 suspect that pt may have recently become a
   chronic CO2 retainer, either from OSA and Obesity Hypoventilation
   Syndrome. Barriers to extubation include possible central muscle
   weakness, pleural effusions. Pt has been on steroids chronically and on
   review with the family it appears her activity level has decompensated
   considerably. Pleural Effusion on prior CT scan also showed RML and RLL
   compression, likely reponsible for her initial dyspnea presentation.
   Will need to maximize lung capcity via effusion reduction.
   - f/u NIF
   - consult IP in the AM for possible pigtail placement in Rt pleural
   effusion
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - RSBI in AM
   ,
   ##. Pleural Effusion: Given the large size of the effusion as well as
   the resulting compression of the RLL and RML on CT scan I suspect that
   this may be the cause of her dyspnea on presentation. Pt underwent
   diagnostic tap at OSH which was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Pt's progression of dyspnea also correlates with slow
   accumulation of effusion. Ddx for exudative effusion include
   infectious, malignancy, auto-immune. Infectious on differential as it
   is most common cause of effusion though pt showed no leukocytosis,
   cough, sputum production on presentation. Pt is currently
   immunosuppressed on her chronic steroid dosing for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] at high risk
   for an infectious process. Will perform BAL in the AM to check for
   infectious process, start on Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage.
   Malignancy is also on differential, cytology is currently pending, tap
   appeared to be amber in colour. Rheum pleurisy is another consideration
   however would expect a low glc.  Now s/p BAL.
   - plan for CT guided [**Female First Name (un) **]/pigtail placement today
   - continue Zosyn/Vanc for empiric coverage
   - f/u sputum cx, cell count, fungal
   - will re-image CT chest following pigtail placement
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Bolus PRN.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion
   - consider TTE today to eval systolic function
   .
   ##. Hyponatremia: Pt was noted to be hyponatremic on admission to
   [**Location (un) 3**] with 123, corrected up to 133 with IVF. Resolved to 139 here
   with NS bolus overnight.
   - trend Na
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Pt was noted to be in A. fib with RVR
   peri-intubation. Unclear as to whether she her nodal agents were held
   in the setting of hypotension versus hypotension occuring in the
   setting of A. fib with RVR. Pt converted to sinus spontaneously when
   placed on her home regimen of digoxin at OSH. Pt currently in sinus
   rhythm, not anticoagulated given h.o. GI bleed.
   - will continue on ASA 325mg
   -currently paced at 60 with good rate control
   - will continue on digoxin, Diltiazem and Metoprolol
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - wean down to home regimen of Prednisone once pigtail is placed.
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.
   ##. UTI: Pt has +Urine Cx for Enterococcus, will continue on Zosyn and
   call lab in the AM for culture results.
   ##. FEN: Pt currently on TF Neutropulm with a goal of 40cc/hr. Will
   obtain Nutrition consult.
   - f/u Nutrition recs

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of longstanding rheumatoid arthritis (RA), tachy-brady syndrome post pacemaker placement (PPM), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A. fib with RVR) not anticoagulated, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bld), and recent discharge for pneumonia (PNA) with suspected sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea. The patient was electively intubated for concern of hypercapnea, and pH readings were 7.39-7.41 in the setting of pCO2 of 69, suspecting that the patient may have recently become a chronic CO2 retainer, either from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Barriers to extubation include possible central muscle weakness, pleural effusions. The patient has been on steroids chronically and on review with the family, it appears her activity level has decompensated considerably. Pleural effusion on prior CT scan also showed right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL) compression, likely responsible for her initial dyspnea presentation.

   TTE: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   ?hypercapneic resp failure w/ exudative pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was electively
   intubated for  hypercapnea. Given pH readings were 7.39-7.41 in the
   setting of pCO2 of 69 suspect that was a chronic CO2 retainer, either
   from OSA and Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Barrier to extubation is
   central muscle weakness. Pt has been on steroids chronically and on
   review with the family it appears her activity level has decompensated
   considerably. NIF -12 supports severe muscle weakness. Pleural Effusion
   on prior CT scan also showed RML and RLL compression but only small
   effusions, likely reponsible for her initial dyspnea presentation but
   unlikely to be causing her current failure to extubate. Currently off
   sedation, so this is not a convuluting factor.
   - neuro consult re: muscle weakness and possible EMG
   - continue current vent settings
   ,
   ## HCT DROP: Hct dropped from 29 to 18 today, repeat showed similar
   result. Most concerning would be hemothorax [**2-21**] thoracentesis
   yesterday. CXR shows worsened infiltrates at upper lobes and stable
   effusions despite thoracentesis. No other obvious source of bleeding.
   - chest CT (non-con) now to evaluate for hemothorax
   - IP vs. IR for repeat [**Female First Name (un) **] and drain placement if bloody
   - send pleural fluid for hematocrit to distinguish bloody effusions
   from hemothorax
   - transfuse 2 U PRBC, repeat post-transfusion Hct
   - q4-6 Hct check depending on post-transf level, transfusion goal>21
   - OGT lavage, guiaic stools
   ##. Pleural Effusion: OSH tap was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Ddx for exudative effusion include infectious,
   malignancy, autoimmune (rheum pleurisy). Pt is currently
   immunosuppressed on her chronic steroid dosing for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] at high risk
   for an infectious process. On Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage. BAL neg
   for infection so far, pleural fluid gram stain neg.
   - continue Zosyn/Vanc for empiric coverage since has new leukocytosis
   today
   - f/u BAL and pleural fluid results
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC jumped from 10.9 to 19.9 today. Possibly [**2-21**]
   hemothorax, although concern for new infectious process.
   - pan-cx this AM
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Pt has had low UOP for [**1-21**] wks PTA.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but UOP only
   minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic
   function, but not reliable in setting of MR. Likely does have impaired
   forward flow and resultant poor renal perfusion. Cr is extremely low at
   baseline suggestive of no muscle mass, and unclear if Cr is good
   measure of GFR due to this.
   - attempt diuresis as BP tolerates and bleeding issue resolved
   - will speak to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about CHF
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Pt was noted to be in A. fib with RVR
   peri-intubation. Pt converted to sinus spontaneously when placed on her
   home regimen of digoxin at OSH. Pt currently in sinus rhythm, not
   anticoagulated given h.o. GI bleed.
   - hold  ASA 325mg in setting of bleed
   -currently paced at 60 with good rate control
   - will continue on digoxin, Diltiazem and Metoprolol
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - home regimen 7.5 mg prednisone daily
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.
   ##. UTI: Pt has +Urine Cx for Enterococcus, will continue on Zosyn and
   call lab in the AM for culture results. Repeat urine cx here is neg.
   ##. FEN: Pt currently on TF Neutropulm with a goal of 40cc/hr. Will
   obtain Nutrition consult.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, tachy-brady syndrome, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and intubated for suspected hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient has exudative pleural effusions, leukocytosis, poor urine output, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently on various medications including sedatives, fentanyl, heparin, and diuretics. Her current condition is stable, but there are concerns about her muscle weakness, potential hemothorax, and possible infections. The patient's family has been informed about her condition and has agreed to full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to hypercapnea, indicating difficulty in breathing and exchanging carbon dioxide. This condition requires careful monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation.
2. Pleural Effusion: The presence of exudative pleural effusions suggests a possible infection or malignancy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and guide appropriate treatment.
3. Leukocytosis: The sudden increase in white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammation. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
4. Poor Urine Output: The patient's low urine output could be due to impaired renal perfusion resulting from mitral regurgitation."

   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   ?hypercapneic resp failure w/ exudative pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was electively
   intubated for  hypercapnea. Given pH readings were 7.39-7.41 in the
   setting of pCO2 of 69 suspect that was a chronic CO2 retainer, either
   from OSA and Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Barriers to extubation
   include possible central muscle weakness, pleural effusions. Pt has
   been on steroids chronically and on review with the family it appears
   her activity level has decompensated considerably. NIF -12 supports
   muscle weakness as barrier to exubation. Pleural Effusion on prior CT
   scan also showed RML and RLL compression, likely reponsible for her
   initial dyspnea presentation. Pigtail now in place, only drained 300cc
   total. RSBI today 167.
   - wean sedation, repeat NIF
   - monitor chest tube output
   ,
   ##. Pleural Effusion: OSH tap was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Ddx for exudative effusion include infectious,
   malignancy, autoimmune (rheum pleurisy). Pt is currently
   immunosuppressed on her chronic steroid dosing for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] at high risk
   for an infectious process. On Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage. BAL neg
   for infection so far, pleural fluid gram stain neg.
   - continue Zosyn/Vanc for empiric coverage
   - f/u BAL and pleural fluid results
   - consider repeat CT chest to evaluate for lung reexpansion following
   thoracentesis
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC jumped from 10.9 to 19.9 today
   - repeat
   .
   #. Hct drop:
   -repeat
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Pt has had low UOP for [**1-21**] PTA.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but UOP only
   minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic
   function, so poor forward flow is not likely to explain poor UOP.
   -
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Pt was noted to be in A. fib with RVR
   peri-intubation. Pt converted to sinus spontaneously when placed on her
   home regimen of digoxin at OSH. Pt currently in sinus rhythm, not
   anticoagulated given h.o. GI bleed.
   - will continue on ASA 325mg
   -currently paced at 60 with good rate control
   - will continue on digoxin, Diltiazem and Metoprolol
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - home regimen 7.5 mg prednisone daily
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.
   ##. UTI: Pt has +Urine Cx for Enterococcus, will continue on Zosyn and
   call lab in the AM for culture results. Repeat urine cx here is neg.
   ##. FEN: Pt currently on TF Neutropulm with a goal of 40cc/hr. Will
   obtain Nutrition consult.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   ?hypercapneic resp failure w/ exudative pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was initially
   intubated for acute hypercapnea [**2-21**] pleural effusions in setting of
   chronic CO2 retention. Effusions are now minimal in size and primary
   barrier to extubation is central muscle weakness. Pa/Fi02 ratio
   indicates [**Doctor Last Name 76**] today, and currently has respiratory alkalosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation
   - appreciate neuro recs: Ach Ab, aldolase pending- steroid myopathy is
   possible
   - will speak to neuromuscular re: EMG
   - wean steroids 60 to 40 mg IV q8, wean further in AM
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Pt was noted to be in A. fib with RVR
   peri-intubation. Pt converted to sinus spontaneously when placed on her
   home regimen of digoxin at OSH. Pt returned to AF with RVR overnight.
   Rate controlled with IV dilt then dilt gtt, Fentanyl gtt.
   Rate currently 150-170s, received extra dose 0.5mg dig and lopressor
   5mg x 3.
   - bolus Fentanyl prn to treat pain/anxiety component
   - start amiodarone gtt
   - cont prior home dose digoxin, dig level 1.5 indicates pt was
   appropriately dig-loaded
   - hold  ASA 325mg in setting of Hct drop
   .
   #. C dif: Leukocytosis continues to rise today. C dif positive and pt
   having frequent loose BM.
   - PO Flagyl
   - monitor fever curve, WBC, symptomatic improvement
   - treat aggressively since pt is at high risk of relapse
   ,
   ## HCT DROP: Hct dropped from 29 to 18 yesterday, stabilized with 2U
   PRBCs and remains stable. Chest CT did not show e/o hemothorax and only
   showed trace effusions. OGT lavage neg. No bloody BM. No other obvious
   source of bleeding.
   - monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   ##. Pleural Effusion: OSH tap was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Thoracentesis here showed transudative picture. Most
   likely explanation is that OSH tap was done after extensive diuresis
   and was more likely falsely concentrated (pseudo-exudative) No e/o
   infection in lungs, but does have increasing leukocytosis.
   - D/C vanco as pt now has other etiology for leukocytosis and there
   does not appear to be any infectious process in lungs
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Pt has had low UOP for [**1-21**] wks PTA.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but UOP only
   minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic
   function, but not reliable in setting of MR. Likely does have impaired
   forward flow and resultant poor renal perfusion. Cr is extremely low at
   baseline suggestive of no muscle mass, and unclear if Cr is good
   measure of GFR due to this.
   - hold off diuresis today in setting of AF/RVR and borderline BPs with
   rate control
   - will speak to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about CHF
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - weaning down steroids q 2 days, 40 mg methylpred today
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.
   .
   ##. FEN: Pt currently on TF Neutropulm with a goal of 40cc/hr.

   ##. DISPOSITION: [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB with RVR): The patient has been experiencing episodes of AFIB with RVR, which is an irregular heart rhythm. It is important to control the patient's heart rate to prevent complications such as heart failure or stroke.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to hypercapneic respiratory failure. Although the pleural effusions have minimized in size, there is still a concern for central muscle weakness as the primary barrier to extubation. Continuous monitoring and weaning off sedation should be done cautiously.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has tested positive for C. diff and is experiencing frequent loose bowel movements. Aggressive treatment is necessary due to the high risk of relapse.

4. HCT drop: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) dropped significantly from 29% to 18% within a day. This could indicate bleeding or fluid shifts. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

5. Pleural Effusion: Initially, the patient had exudative pleural effusions, but subsequent thoracentesis showed a transudative picture. The most likely explanation is that the initial tap was done after extensive diuresis, resulting in a falsely concentrated effusion. Close monitoring is required to ensure resolution of"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   ?hypercapneic resp failure w/ exudative pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was electively
   intubated for  hypercapnea. Given pH readings were 7.39-7.41 in the
   setting of pCO2 of 69 suspect that was a chronic CO2 retainer. Barrier
   to extubation is central muscle weakness. Pt has been on steroids
   chronically and on review with the family it appears her activity level
   has decompensated considerably. NIF -12 supports severe muscle
   weakness. Pleural Effusion on prior CT scan also showed RML and RLL
   compression but only small effusions, likely reponsible for her initial
   dyspnea presentation but unlikely to be causing her current failure to
   extubate. Currently off sedation, so this is not a convuluting factor.
   Pa/Fi02 ratio indicates [**Doctor Last Name 76**].
   - appreciate neuro recs: Ach Ab, aldolase pending- likely steroid
   myopathy
   - currently has respiratory alkalosis with appropriate metabolic
   compensation
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Pt was noted to be in A. fib with RVR
   peri-intubation. Pt converted to sinus spontaneously when placed on her
   home regimen of digoxin at OSH. Pt returned to AF with RVR overnight.
   Rate controlled with IV dilt then dilt gtt, Fentanyl gtt.
   Rate currently 150-170s, received extra dose 0.5mg dig and lopressor
   5mg x 3.
   - bolus Fentanyl prn
   - reload digoxin
   - hold  ASA 325mg in setting of Hct drop
   ,
   ## HCT DROP: Hct dropped from 29 to 18 today, stabilized with 2U PRBCs.
   Chest CT did not show e/o hemothorax and only showed trace effusions.
   OGT lavage neg. No bloody BM. No other obvious source of bleeding.
   - monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   ##. Pleural Effusion: OSH tap was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Thoracentesis here showed transudative picture, may be
   pseudotransudative with CHF on top of exudative process. No e/o
   infection in lungs, but does have increasing leukocytosis. On
   Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage.
   - continue Zosyn/Vanc for empiric coverage since leukocytosis worsening
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC jumped from 10.9 to 19.9 today. No localizing
   signs/sx for infectious process.

   ##Poor Urine Output:  Pt has had low UOP for [**1-21**] wks PTA.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but UOP only
   minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic
   function, but not reliable in setting of MR. Likely does have impaired
   forward flow and resultant poor renal perfusion. Cr is extremely low at
   baseline suggestive of no muscle mass, and unclear if Cr is good
   measure of GFR due to this.
   - attempt diuresis as BP tolerates and bleeding issue resolved
   - will speak to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about CHF

   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), tachy-brady syndrome post pacemaker placement (PPM), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and previous pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted for dyspnea and intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure with exudative pleural effusions. The patient has been on steroids chronically and has central muscle weakness, making extubation challenging. She has respiratory alkalosis with appropriate metabolic compensation. The patient's HCT dropped from 29 to 18 today, stabilized with 2U PRBCs. Chest CT did not show evidence of hemothorax and only showed trace effusions. Thoracentesis showed a transudative picture, which may be pseudotransudative with congestive heart failure (CHF) on top of an exudative process. No evidence of infection in the lungs, but leukocytosis is worsening. She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for empiric coverage. The patient has had low urine output for 1 week post-transfusion. Urine electrolytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but urine output only minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic function, but not reliable in the setting of mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient has impaired forward flow and"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   ?hypercapneic resp failure w/ exudative pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was initially
   intubated for acute hypercapnea [**2-21**] pleural effusions in setting of
   chronic CO2 retention. Effusions are now minimal in size and primary
   barrier to extubation is central muscle weakness. Pa/Fi02 ratio
   indicates [**Doctor Last Name 76**] today, and currently has respiratory alkalosis with
   appropriate metabolic compensation
   - appreciate neuro recs: Ach Ab, aldolase pending- steroid myopathy is
   possible
   - will speak to neuromuscular re: EMG
   - wean steroids 60 to 40 mg IV q8, wean further in AM
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Pt was noted to be in A. fib with RVR
   peri-intubation. Pt converted to sinus spontaneously when placed on her
   home regimen of digoxin at OSH. Pt returned to AF with RVR overnight.
   Rate controlled with IV dilt then dilt gtt, Fentanyl gtt.
   Rate currently 150-170s, received extra dose 0.5mg dig and lopressor
   5mg x 3.
   - bolus Fentanyl prn to treat pain/anxiety component
   - start amiodarone gtt
   - cont prior home dose digoxin, dig level 1.5 indicates pt was
   appropriately dig-loaded
   - hold  ASA 325mg in setting of Hct drop
   .
   #. C dif: Leukocytosis continues to rise today. C dif positive and pt
   having frequent loose BM.
   - PO Flagyl
   - monitor fever curve, WBC, symptomatic improvement
   - treat aggressively since pt is at high risk of relapse
   ,
   ## HCT DROP: Hct dropped from 29 to 18 yesterday, stabilized with 2U
   PRBCs and remains stable. Chest CT did not show e/o hemothorax and only
   showed trace effusions. OGT lavage neg. No bloody BM. No other obvious
   source of bleeding.
   - monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   ##. Pleural Effusion: OSH tap was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Thoracentesis here showed transudative picture. Most
   likely explanation is that OSH tap was done after extensive diuresis
   and was more likely falsely concentrated (pseudo-exudative) No e/o
   infection in lungs, but does have increasing leukocytosis.
   - D/C vanco as pt now has other etiology for leukocytosis and there
   does not appear to be any infectious process in lungs
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Pt has had low UOP for [**1-21**] wks PTA.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but UOP only
   minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic
   function, but not reliable in setting of MR. Likely does have impaired
   forward flow and resultant poor renal perfusion. Cr is extremely low at
   baseline suggestive of no muscle mass, and unclear if Cr is good
   measure of GFR due to this.
   - hold off diuresis today in setting of AF/RVR and borderline BPs with
   rate control
   - will speak to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about CHF
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - weaning down steroids q 2 days, 40 mg methylpred today
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.
   .
   ##. FEN: Pt currently on TF Neutropulm with a goal of 40cc/hr.

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), tachy-brady syndrome after pacemaker placement, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) not anticoagulated, gastrointestinal bleeding, recent discharge for pneumonia (PNA) with possible sepsis, and acute hypercapneic respiratory failure with exudative pleural effusions. The patient was initially intubated for acute hypercapnea and pleural effusions in the setting of chronic CO2 retention. Effusions are now minimal in size and the primary barrier to extubation is central muscle weakness. The patient's Pa/FiO2 ratio indicates respiratory alkalosis with appropriate metabolic compensation.

The patient's medical history includes RA, tachy-brady syndrome after pacemaker placement, AF with RVR, gastrointestinal bleeding, recent discharge for PNA with possible sepsis, and acute hypercapneic respiratory failure with exudative pleural effusions. The patient is currently on multiple medications including amiodarone, diltiazem, fentanyl, prednisone, lopressor, and digoxin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 124 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's"

   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   ?hypercapneic resp failure w/ ? exudative pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was initially
   intubated for acute hypercapnea [**2-21**] pleural effusions in setting of
   chronic CO2 retention. Effusions are now minimal in size and primary
   barrier to extubation is central muscle weakness.
   - appreciate neuro recs: Ach Ab, aldolase pending- steroid myopathy on
   differential
   - apprectiate neuromuscular recs -> unable to get MR due to PPM, will
   consider CT neck
   - wean steroids to 20 mg IV q8
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Pt was noted to be in A. fib with RVR
   peri-intubation. Pt converted to sinus spontaneously when placed on her
   home regimen of digoxin at OSH. Pt returned to AF with RVR, difficult
   rate control yesterday. Rate initially controlled with IV dilt then
   dilt gtt, Fentanyl gtt.   Receiving amio load, transiently in NSR this
   morning, now back in a. fib.  Rate currently 100s.  Hopefully treating
   C. diff infection will aid management of a. fib.
   - cont amiodarone load orally
   - DC cardioversion if refractory hypotension
   - decrease digoxin by half given interaction with amio
   - hold  ASA 325mg in setting of recentHct drop
   .
   #. C dif: Leukocytosis continues to rise today. C dif positive and pt
   having frequent loose BM.
   - IV Flagyl, unable to tolerate PO
   - monitor fever curve, WBC, symptomatic improvement
   - treat aggressively since pt is at high risk of relapse
   ,
   ## HCT DROP: Hct dropped from 29 to 18 2 days ago, stabilized with 2U
   PRBCs and remains stable. Chest CT did not show e/o hemothorax and only
   showed trace effusions. OGT lavage neg. No bloody BM. No other obvious
   source of bleeding.
   - monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   ##. Pleural Effusion: OSH tap was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Thoracentesis here showed transudative picture. Most
   likely explanation is that OSH tap was done after extensive diuresis
   and was more likely falsely concentrated (pseudo-exudative) No e/o
   infection in lungs.
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Pt has had low UOP for [**1-21**] wks PTA.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but UOP only
   minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic
   function, but not reliable in setting of MR. Likely does have impaired
   forward flow and resultant poor renal perfusion. Cr is extremely low at
   baseline suggestive of no muscle mass, and unclear if Cr is good
   measure of GFR due to this.
   - hold off diuresis in setting of recurrent AF/RVR and borderline BPs
   with rate control
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - weaning down steroids q 2 days, 20 mg methylpred today
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.
   .
   ##. FEN: Pt currently on TF Neutropulm with a goal of 40cc/hr.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and tachy-brady syndrome who was admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and intubated for hypercapneic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), which has been poorly controlled despite medication. She also has a positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is being treated with IV Flagyl. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 29% to 18% over the past two days, but it has stabilized after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). There is also evidence of pleural effusion, but it is minimal in size now. The patient has had poor urine output for the past week, which may be due to impaired renal perfusion. Additionally, the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and is currently on steroids for treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial reason for intubation was acute hypercapnea, and there is a risk of ongoing respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AF with RVR): The patient's AF with RVR is poorly controlled, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   hypercapneic resp failure w/ bilateral pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was initially
   intubated for acute hypercapnea [**2-21**] pleural effusions in setting of
   chronic CO2 retention. Effusions are now minimal in size per CT and
   primary barrier to extubation is central muscle weakness. Pt has had
   indolent decline for 6 months. Ddx includes autoimmune myositis,
   degenerative neuropathy (ALS), cord compression [**2-21**] multiple
   compression fractures. Steroid myopathy and ICU myositis seem less
   likely given course.  Aldolase elevated.
   - appreciate neuro recs: Ach Ab, myoglobin pending
   - could consider anti-Jo1 for autoimmune polymyositis and EMG but
   unlikely to see significant improvement in the near future with
   treatment, has already been on several days high dose steroids and has
   multiple other medical issues that contribute to poor prognosis
   - apprectiate neuromuscular recs -> unable to get MR due to PPM
   - continue to wean steroids (day 2 of 20 mg IV q8, which is equivalent
   to 75mg daily of prednisone, 10 times home dose)
   - likely terminal extubation today
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Rate has been difficult to control. On amiodarone
   load and half-home dose digoxin. Rates 100s, improved since yesterday.
   Hopefully treating C. diff infection will aid management of a. fib.
   - cont amiodarone load orally at 400 mg TID
   - DC cardioversion if refractory hypotension
   - decrease digoxin by half given interaction with amio
   - hold  ASA 325mg in setting of recentHct drop
   .
   #. C dif: Leukocytosis decreasing, afebrile.
   - IV Flagyl (D3), unable to tolerate PO
   - monitor fever curve, WBC, symptomatic improvement
   - treat aggressively since pt is at high risk of relapse
   ,
   ## HCT DROP: Hct dropped from 29 to 18 2 days ago, stabilized with 2U
   PRBCs and remains stable. Chest CT did not show e/o hemothorax and only
   showed trace effusions. OGT lavage neg. No bloody BM. Hct dropped again
   overnight 25 to 20, again with no obvious source.
   - hemolysis labs, DIC labs
   - monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - would consider CT AB/PELV and thigh if clinically more stable
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: worsened today with elevated PT, PTT and declining
   platelets.
   - added on DIC labs
   - may be nutritional component given chronic illness, will replete
   vitamin K today since bleeding
   ##. Pleural Effusion: OSH tap was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Thoracentesis here showed transudative picture. Most
   likely explanation is that OSH tap was done after extensive diuresis
   and was more likely falsely concentrated (pseudo-exudative) No e/o
   infection in lungs. CXR stable.
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Pt has had low UOP for [**1-21**] wks PTA.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but UOP only
   minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic
   function, but not reliable in setting of MR. Likely does have impaired
   forward flow and resultant poor renal perfusion. Cr is extremely low at
   baseline suggestive of no muscle mass, and unclear if Cr is good
   measure of GFR due to this.
   - consider attempting very gentle diuresis today if rate control/BP
   stable, however unlikely that kidneys will mount good response and
   patient not candidate for HD given poor prognosis
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - weaning down steroids q 2 days, 20 mg methylpred today
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), tachy-brady syndrome, and atrial fibrillation (AF) who was admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and acute hypercapneic respiratory failure. She underwent intubation and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues including central muscle weakness, possible autoimmune myositis or degenerative neuropathy, pleural effusions, C. difficile infection, hemolysis, coagulopathy, and poor urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central muscle weakness: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator may be due to central muscle weakness, which can be a complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Autoimmune myositis or degenerative neuropathy: These conditions can cause muscle weakness and contribute to the patient's difficulty in weaning off the ventilator.
3. Pleural effusions: The presence of pleural effusions can lead to respiratory compromise and further difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation.
4. C. difficile infection: This infection can cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances that may affect the patient's overall condition.
5. Hemolysis: The drop in hemoglobin levels and the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear suggest hemolysis, which can result in anemia and potentially worsen the patient's respiratory status.
6. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT and PTT values indicate a coagulation disorder, which may increase the risk of bleeding and complicate the patient's clinical course.
7. Poor urine output: The patient's low urine output may be due to renal dysfunction, dehydration, or poor perfusion, all of which can contribute to her overall instability.

These are the potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y.o. Female w/ longstanding RA, tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM, A. fib
   with RVR not anticoagulated [**2-21**] GI bld, s/p recent d/c for PNA w/
   ?sepsis initially admitted to [**Location (un) 3**] for dyspnea s/p intubation for
   hypercapneic resp failure w/ bilateral pleural effusions.
   ##. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure s/p Intubation: Pt was initially
   intubated for acute hypercapnea [**2-21**] pleural effusions in setting of
   chronic CO2 retention. Effusions are now minimal in size per CT and
   primary barrier to extubation is central muscle weakness. Pt has had
   indolent decline for 6 months. Ddx includes autoimmune myositis,
   degenerative neuropathy (ALS), cord compression [**2-21**] multiple
   compression fractures. Steroid myopathy and ICU myositis seem less
   likely given course.  Aldolase elevated.
   - appreciate neuro recs: Ach Ab, myoglobin pending
   - consider anti-Jo1 for autoimmune polymyositis
   - apprectiate neuromuscular recs -> unable to get MR due to PPM, will
   consider CT neck if thought to be helpful
   - consider EMG
   - continue to wean steroids (day 2 of 20 mg IV q8, which is equivalent
   to 75mg daily of prednisone, 10 times home dose)
   .
   ##. A. Fib with RVR: Rate has been difficult to control. On amiodarone
   load and half-home dose digoxin. Rates 100s, improved since yesterday.
   Hopefully treating C. diff infection will aid management of a. fib.
   - cont amiodarone load orally at 300 mg TID
   - DC cardioversion if refractory hypotension
   - decrease digoxin by half given interaction with amio
   - hold  ASA 325mg in setting of recentHct drop
   .
   #. C dif: Leukocytosis decreasing, afebrile.
   - IV Flagyl (D3), unable to tolerate PO
   - monitor fever curve, WBC, symptomatic improvement
   - treat aggressively since pt is at high risk of relapse
   ,
   ## HCT DROP: Hct dropped from 29 to 18 2 days ago, stabilized with 2U
   PRBCs and remains stable. Chest CT did not show e/o hemothorax and only
   showed trace effusions. OGT lavage neg. No bloody BM. Hct dropped again
   overnight 25 to 20, again with no obvious source.
   - hemolysis labs, DIC labs
   - monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: worsened today with elevated PT, PTT and declining
   platelets.
   - added on DIC labs
   - may be nutritional component given chronic illness, will replete
   vitamin K today since bleeding
   ##. Pleural Effusion: OSH tap was notable for an exudative effusion, pH
   >7, Glc  127. Thoracentesis here showed transudative picture. Most
   likely explanation is that OSH tap was done after extensive diuresis
   and was more likely falsely concentrated (pseudo-exudative) No e/o
   infection in lungs. CXR stable.
   .
   ##Poor Urine Output:  Pt has had low UOP for [**1-21**] wks PTA.
   Urine lytes suggest intravascular volume depletion, but UOP only
   minimally responds to fluid boluses. TTE showed normal systolic
   function, but not reliable in setting of MR. Likely does have impaired
   forward flow and resultant poor renal perfusion. Cr is extremely low at
   baseline suggestive of no muscle mass, and unclear if Cr is good
   measure of GFR due to this.
   - consider attempting very gentle diuresis today if rate control/BP
   stable, however unlikely that kidneys will mount good response and
   patient not candidate for HD given poor prognosis
   .
   ##. RA: Will continue pt on home regimen of plaquenil. Pt currently on
   Solumedrol, will wean down to home regimen of Prednisone.
   - weaning down steroids q 2 days, 20 mg methylpred today
   ##. GERD: Continue on home regimen of Prevacid.
   .
   ##. FEN: Pt currently on TF Neutropulm with a goal of 40cc/hr.
   - f/u Nutrition recs
   ##. Ppx: Pt on Lansoprazole, Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
   ##. ACCESS: R IJ, left radial line

   [**Name (NI) **], husband and daughter on [**2158-1-25**] while pt currently intubated in
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]. Cardioversion for AF with RVR is still acceptable, no chest
