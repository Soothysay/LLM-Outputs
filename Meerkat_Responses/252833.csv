   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M NASH cirrhosis c/b varices/ascites, ESRD on HD, and chronic
   wound infection now transferred to ICU with hypotension after HD and
   missing midodrine doses
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: Baseline BP in 80-90's.  Blood pressures are
   extremetly positional c/w h/o orthostatic hypotension.  No clear
   infectious source and lower suspicion of SBP clinically as no history
   of fever, abdominal pain, mental status changes but paracentesis
   consistent  with SBP.  Difficult to reconcile new neck pain with
   hypotension other than ?dissection or spinal infarct.  However, exam
   shows no other focal neurological signs c/w spinal cord injury at this
   time, and there is no mediastinal widening or asymetry to blood
   pressures.  Possible that abominal distension is impairing venous
   return and causing hypotension
   - Continue midodrine via dobhoff.
   - continue Levophed with goal SBP > 85
   - hold nadolol
   - Check AM cortisol given relative disconnect between hemodynamics and
   overall acuity.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim as needed.
   - continue micafungin and daptomycin and add meropenem for SBP
   - f/u cultures
   - Gentle IVF's with attention to respiratory status.
   - Has PICC in place, but consider CVL for measurement of CVP.
   - Echo if remains hypotensive w/o clear explanation.
   .
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:
   - f/u cultures
   -  add meropenem to daptomycin and micafungin pending culture and
   sensitivities (narrow as rapidly as possible)
   - monitor renal function
   - albumin 1.5mg/kg at diagnosis
   - albumin 1mg/kg on day 3 ([**2120-5-29**])
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Likely compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension.
   CXR ugly without focality.
   - Monitor volume status closely
   - sputum if able
   .
   # Neck Pain: Is not focal enough to be c/w epidural abscess although
   that is potential concern.  Would obtain CT c/t spine with contrast to
   evaluate for fracture/abscess or other abnormality.  Exam not c/w
   spinal infarct, and vascular dissection also inconsistent with current
   reproducible pain on exam.
   - pain control with morphine prn
   - warm compresses
   - f/u final read CT Neck/T-spine
   .
   # RLE infection: pt had a chronic RLE cellulitis and osteomyelitis
   secondary to a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open
   trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**], s/p 5 debridements
   and revisions with non healing R ankle wound during the last admission
   and was discharged to LTAC with vac dressing and on daptomycin and
   micafungin to treat VRE and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] until [**2120-5-26**]. He was seen
   in the ortho clinic on [**5-21**], and after the vac dressing was removed
   frank pus was seen. Patient is s/p I&D on [**5-24**]. In the OR, patient was
   noted to have good vessels, indicating good prognosis for eventual
   healing. External fixator removed and vac dressing placed.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin and micafungin for now
   - per ID recs during the last admission, pt needs qweek checks of cbc,
   diff, lft, bun, cr, cpk, esr, crp while on abx
   - f/u blood cx and mycolytic/fungal cx
   - vac dressing q2d
   - keep leg elevated
   .
   # Dobhoff dysfunction/Dysphagia and poor PO intake: Dobhoff working
   now.  Patient failed s/s and video swallow on [**5-22**] due to muscle
   weakness and aspirations. Dobhoff was placed on [**5-22**].
   - NPO
   - continue TF via dobhoff
   - appreciate nutrition recs
   - avoid TPN given liver issues
   - tongue sore: ice chips, viscous lidocaine prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Stable, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  [**Month (only) 11**] need repeat
   paracentesis, but no belly pain currently.
   - Place foley in the AM and check bladder pressure.
   - monitor mental status
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin and hold nadolol given hypotension.
   - titrate to [**4-11**] BM daily
   - continue PPI
   - monitor hct daily
   - LFT q2-3 days
   - Liver FYI (followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   .
   # ESRD: due to hepatorenal syndrome, on HD with ? TuThuSat schedule.
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue HD as tolerated by BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   - trend electrolytes
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   - continue calcium acetate
   - continue midodrine

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, chronic wound infection, and other comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension after HD and missing midodrine doses. The patient has several ongoing medical issues including hypotension/shock, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypoxemia, neck pain, RLE infection, dobbhoff dysfunction/dysphagia, poor PO intake, cirrhosis, ESRD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, thrombocytopenia, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 80-90's, and blood pressures are extremely positional. This could indicate orthostatic hypotension, which may be due to his cirrhosis. It is important to continue midodrine and Levophed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has signs consistent with SBP, and cultures have been obtained. Antibiotics have been started, and albumin will be given at diagnosis and on day 3. Monitoring renal function and following up with cultures are necessary.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may be due to compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension. Monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M NASH cirrhosis c/b varices/ascites, ESRD on HD, and chronic
   wound infection now transferred to ICU with hypotension after HD and
   missing midodrine doses
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock: Baseline BP in 80-90's.  Blood pressures are
   extremetly positional c/w h/o orthostatic hypotension.  No clear
   infectious source and lower suspicion of SBP clinically as no history
   of fever, abdominal pain, mental status changes but paracentesis
   consistent  with SBP.  Difficult to reconcile new neck pain with
   hypotension other than ?dissection or spinal infarct.  However, exam
   shows no other focal neurological signs c/w spinal cord injury at this
   time, and there is no mediastinal widening or asymetry to blood
   pressures.  Possible that abominal distension is impairing venous
   return and causing hypotension
   - Continue midodrine via dobhoff.
   - continue Levophed with goal SBP > 80
   - hold nadolol
   - Check AM cortisol given relative disconnect between hemodynamics and
   overall acuity.  [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim as needed.
   - continue micafungin and daptomycin and add meropenem for SBP
   - f/u cultures
   - Gentle IVF's with attention to respiratory status.
   - Has PICC in place, but consider CVL for measurement of CVP.
   - Echo if remains hypotensive w/o clear explanation.
   .
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:
   - f/u cultures
   -  add meropenem to daptomycin and micafungin pending culture and
   sensitivities
   - monitor renal function
   - albumin 1.5mg/kg at diagnosis
   - albumin 1mg/kg on day 3
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Likely compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension.
   CXR ugly without focality.
   - Monitor volume status closely
   - sputum if able
   .
   # Neck Pain: Is not focal enough to be c/w epidural abscess although
   that is potential concern.  Would obtain CT c/t spine with contrast to
   evaluate for fracture/abscess or other abnormality.  Exam not c/w
   spinal infarct, and vascular dissection also inconsistent with current
   reproducible pain on exam.
   - pain control with morphine prn
   - warm compresses
   - CT Neck/T-spine
   .
   # RLE infection: pt had a chronic RLE cellulitis and osteomyelitis
   secondary to a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open
   trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**], s/p 5 debridements
   and revisions with non healing R ankle wound during the last admission
   and was discharged to LTAC with vac dressing and on daptomycin and
   micafungin to treat VRE and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] until [**2120-5-26**]. He was seen
   in the ortho clinic on [**5-21**], and after the vac dressing was removed
   frank pus was seen. Patient is s/p I&D on [**5-24**]. In the OR, patient was
   noted to have good vessels, indicating good prognosis for eventual
   healing. External fixator removed and vac dressing placed.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin and micafungin for now
   - per ID recs during the last admission, pt needs qweek checks of cbc,
   diff, lft, bun, cr, cpk, esr, crp while on abx
   - f/u blood cx and mycolytic/fungal cx
   - vac dressing q2d
   - keep leg elevated
   .
   # Dobhoff dysfunction/Dysphagia and poor PO intake: Dobhoff working
   now.  Patient failed s/s and video swallow on [**5-22**] due to muscle
   weakness and aspirations. Dobhoff was placed on [**5-22**].
   - NPO
   - continue TF via dobhoff
   - appreciate nutrition recs
   - avoid TPN given liver issues
   - tongue sore: ice chips, viscous lidocaine prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Stable, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  [**Month (only) 11**] need repeat
   paracentesis, but no belly pain currently.
   - Place foley in the AM and check bladder pressure.
   - monitor mental status
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin and hold nadolol given hypotension.
   - titrate to [**4-11**] BM daily
   - continue PPI
   - monitor hct daily
   - LFT q2-3 days
   .
   # ESRD: due to hepatorenal syndrome, on HD with TuThuSat schedule.
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue HD as tolerated by BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   - trend electrolytes
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   - continue calcium acetate
   - continue midodrine

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, chronic wound infection, ESRD on HD, and hypotension after HD and missing midodrine doses. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), neck pain, chronic RLE infection, dobbhoff dysfunction/dysphagia, poor PO intake, cirrhosis, ESRD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 80-90's and is extremely positional, indicating orthostatic hypotension. This may be due to abdominal distension impairing venous return and causing hypotension. Continuous midodrine and norepinephrine infusions are being given to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has been diagnosed with SBP, evidenced by the presence of pus in the paracentesis. He is currently receiving meropenem, micafungin, and daptomycin for SBP. Monitoring of renal function and follow-up cultures are planned.

3. Neck pain: The patient's neck pain is not focal enough to be consistent with an epidural abscess. However, a CT of the neck/T"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of NASH/cirrhosis, ESRD on HD due to HRS, and orthostatic hypotension. He was admitted for a non-healing wound infection and received wound debridement and vacuum-assisted closure. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension on the floor and received midodrine. He underwent dialysis yesterday and experienced hypotension in the 60s. Pressors were started via a peripherally inserted central catheter (PIC) line, and he was transferred to the ICU emergently. The patient has been complaining of neck pain, and his blood pressure has been in the 70s/40s. Levophed was initiated, and his blood pressure improved. He received meropenem and albumin overnight.

   Micro: peritoneal fluid growing gram negative rods
   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M NASH cirrhosis c/b varices/ascites, ESRD on HD, and chronic
   wound infection now transferred to ICU with hypotension after HD and
   missing midodrine doses
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:  Patient with baseline low blood pressure (SBP
   80-90s). Now with significant positional change in blood pressure
   consistent with orthostatic hypotension.  This is in the setting of
   missing midodrine due to blocked dophoff.  Nadolol could also be
   contributing to orthostasis.  No clear infectious source although
   paracentesis with cell count profile c/w SBP.
   Possible that abominal distension is impairing venous return and
   causing hypotension.  Adrenal insufficiency considered although AM
   cortisol within normal limits.
   - Continue midodrine via dobhoff.
   - continue Levophed with goal SBP > 85
   - hold nadolol
   - continue micafungin and daptomycin for foot wound and meropenem for
   SBP
   - Gentle IVF's with attention to respiratory status.
   - Echo if remains hypotensive w/o clear explanation.
   .
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:  Most likely primary SBP given
   cell count profile.  He was started on meropenem and given albumin
   1.5mg/kg on [**5-27**].  Peritoneal fluid growing gram negative rods.
   - f/u speciation and sensitivity
   -  continue meropenem and narrow once sensitivity returns
   - f/u hepatology recs -
 no need for further albumin
   - monitor renal function
   .
   # RLE infection: pt had a chronic RLE cellulitis and osteomyelitis
   secondary to a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open
   trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**], s/p 5 debridements
   and revisions with non healing R ankle wound during the last admission
   and was discharged to LTAC with vac dressing and on daptomycin and
   micafungin to treat VRE and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] until [**2120-5-26**]. He was seen
   in the ortho clinic on [**5-21**], and after the vac dressing was removed
   frank pus was seen. Patient is s/p I&D on [**5-24**]. In the OR, patient was
   noted to have good vessels, indicating good prognosis for eventual
   healing. External fixator removed and vac dressing placed.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin and micafungin for now
   - per ID recs during the last admission, pt needs qweek checks of cbc,
   diff, lft, bun, cr, cpk, esr, crp while on abx
   - f/u cultures
   - VAC change Q2D - next VAC change Wed [**5-29**]
   - keep leg elevated
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Likely compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension.
   CXR ugly without focality.
   - Monitor volume status closely
   - sputum if able
   .
   # Neck Pain: Is not focal enough to be c/w epidural abscess although
   that is potential concern.  Would obtain CT c/t spine with contrast to
   evaluate for fracture/abscess or other abnormality.  Exam not c/w
   spinal infarct, and vascular dissection also inconsistent with current
   reproducible pain on exam.
   - pain control with morphine prn
   - warm compresses
   - lidocaine patch, Tylenol PRN, ultram PRN (will monitor BPs)
   # Dobhoff dysfunction/Dysphagia and poor PO intake: Dobhoff working
   now.  Patient failed s/s and video swallow on [**5-22**] due to muscle
   weakness and aspirations. Dobhoff was placed on [**5-22**].
   - NPO
   - continue TF via dobhoff
   - appreciate nutrition recs
   - avoid TPN given liver issues
   - tongue sore: ice chips, viscous lidocaine prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Stable, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  [**Month (only) 11**] need repeat
   paracentesis, but no belly pain currently.
   - Place foley in the AM and check bladder pressure.
   - monitor mental status
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -  hold nadolol given hypotension.
   - titrate to [**4-11**] BM daily
   - continue PPI
   - monitor hct daily
   - LFT q2-3 days
   - F/U liver recs
   .
   # ESRD: due to hepatorenal syndrome, on HD with  TuThuSat schedule.
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue HD as tolerated by BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   - trend electrolytes
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   - continue calcium acetate
   - continue midodrine
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with extreme insulin resistence:
   - continue insulin
   - diabetic diet
   - FS QID
   .
   # Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue CPAP
   .
   # Depression:
   - continue escitalopram and bupropion
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely [**3-12**] cirrhosis
   - trend
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, continue tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, PICC.
   # Communication: Patient and friend who is HCP [**Name (NI) **] home

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history including NASH cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, chronic wound infection, and other comorbidities. The patient is currently in the ICU for hypotension after hemodialysis and missing midodrine doses.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient has a history of low blood pressure, and now presents with significant positional change in blood pressure consistent with orthostatic hypotension. This may be due to missing midodrine doses and could potentially worsen if not managed appropriately.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has developed SBP, indicated by the presence of gram-negative rods in the peritoneal fluid. This condition requires prompt antibiotic treatment and close monitoring of renal function.

3. RLE Infection: The patient has a chronic infection in the right lower extremity (RLE), including cellulitis and osteomyelitis. This infection requires ongoing treatment with appropriate antibiotics and close monitoring for any signs of worsening.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia likely due to compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension. Close monitoring of respiratory status and possible interventions such as sputum evaluation or bronchoscopy might be necessary.

5. Neck Pain: The patient's neck pain requires further evaluation"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M NASH cirrhosis c/b varices/ascites, ESRD on HD, and chronic
   wound infection now transferred to ICU with hypotension after HD and
   missing midodrine doses
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:  Patient with baseline low blood pressure (SBP
   80-90s). Now with significant positional change in blood pressure
   consistent with orthostatic hypotension.  This is in the setting of
   missing midodrine due to blocked dophoff.  Nadolol could also be
   contributing to orthostasis.  No clear infectious source although
   paracentesis with cell count profile c/w SBP.
   Possible that abominal distension is impairing venous return and
   causing hypotension.  Adrenal insufficiency considered although AM
   cortisol within normal limits.
   - Continue midodrine via dobhoff.
   - continue Levophed with goal SBP > 85
   - hold nadolol
   - continue micafungin and daptomycin for foot wound and meropenem for
   SBP
   - Gentle IVF's with attention to respiratory status.
   - Echo if remains hypotensive w/o clear explanation.
   .
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:  Most likely primary SBP given
   cell count profile.  He was started on meropenem and given albumin
   1.5mg/kg on [**5-27**].  Peritoneal fluid growing gram negative rods.
   - f/u speciation and sensitivity
   -  continue meropenem and narrow once sensitivity returns
   - f/u hepatology recs -
 no need for further albumin
   - monitor renal function
   .
   .
   # RLE infection: pt had a chronic RLE cellulitis and osteomyelitis
   secondary to a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open
   trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**], s/p 5 debridements
   and revisions with non healing R ankle wound during the last admission
   and was discharged to LTAC with vac dressing and on daptomycin and
   micafungin to treat VRE and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] until [**2120-5-26**]. He was seen
   in the ortho clinic on [**5-21**], and after the vac dressing was removed
   frank pus was seen. Patient is s/p I&D on [**5-24**]. In the OR, patient was
   noted to have good vessels, indicating good prognosis for eventual
   healing. External fixator removed and vac dressing placed.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin and micafungin for now
   - per ID recs during the last admission, pt needs qweek checks of cbc,
   diff, lft, bun, cr, cpk, esr, crp while on abx
   - f/u cultures
   - VAC change Q2D - next VAC change Wed [**5-29**]
   - keep leg elevated
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Likely compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension.
   CXR ugly without focality.
   - Monitor volume status closely
   - sputum if able
   .
   # Neck Pain: Is not focal enough to be c/w epidural abscess although
   that is potential concern.  Would obtain CT c/t spine with contrast to
   evaluate for fracture/abscess or other abnormality.  Exam not c/w
   spinal infarct, and vascular dissection also inconsistent with current
   reproducible pain on exam.
   - pain control with morphine prn
   - warm compresses
   # Dobhoff dysfunction/Dysphagia and poor PO intake: Dobhoff working
   now.  Patient failed s/s and video swallow on [**5-22**] due to muscle
   weakness and aspirations. Dobhoff was placed on [**5-22**].
   - NPO
   - continue TF via dobhoff
   - appreciate nutrition recs
   - avoid TPN given liver issues
   - tongue sore: ice chips, viscous lidocaine prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Stable, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  [**Month (only) 11**] need repeat
   paracentesis, but no belly pain currently.
   - Place foley in the AM and check bladder pressure.
   - monitor mental status
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -  hold nadolol given hypotension.
   - titrate to [**4-11**] BM daily
   - continue PPI
   - monitor hct daily
   - LFT q2-3 days

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, chronic wound infection, and type 2 diabetes mellitus with extreme insulin resistance. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension after HD and missing midodrine doses. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), right lower extremity (RLE) infection, hypoxemia, neck pain, dysphagia, and poor oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, and there is a concern for orthostatic hypotension, possibly due to missed midodrine doses. The cause of hypotension is still unclear, and further evaluation may be necessary.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has developed SBP, which is indicated by the presence of gram-negative rods in the peritoneal fluid. He is currently being treated with meropenem, and the plan is to continue the antibiotic based on the sensitivity results.
3. Right Lower Extremity (RLE) Infection: The patient has a chronic RLE cellulitis and osteomyelitis secondary to a traumatic injury. He underwent an incision and drainage procedure, and the wound is currently being treated with daptomycin and micafungin. Regular wound care and monitoring are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), admitted with hepatorenal syndrome (HOTN) in the setting of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hemodialysis (HD). The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, lactulose, rifaxamin, and others. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with several complications related to his underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP, which can lead to sepsis, especially considering his critical condition.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HOTN): The patient's renal function is compromised due to cirrhosis, leading to HOTN. This condition requires careful management of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's cirrhosis may lead to further deterioration in liver function, potentially resulting in hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure or severe hypoxia.
5. Infections: The patient is at high risk for developing additional infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
6. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Malnutrition: Prolonged ICU stay"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M NASH cirrhosis c/b varices/ascites, ESRD on HD, and chronic
   wound infection now transferred to ICU with hypotension after HD and
   missing midodrine doses
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:  Patient with baseline low blood pressure (SBP
   80-90s). Now with significant positional change in blood pressure
   consistent with orthostatic hypotension.  This is in the setting of
   missing midodrine due to blocked dophoff.  Nadolol could also be
   contributing to orthostasis.  Paracentesis with cell count profile c/w
   SBP.  Possible that abominal distension is impairing venous return and
   causing hypotension.  Adrenal insufficiency considered although AM
   cortisol within normal limits.
   - Continue midodrine via dobhoff
   - continue octreotide
   - continue Levophed with goal SBP > 85
   - hold nadolol
   - TTE
   - continue micafungin and daptomycin for foot wound and meropenem for
   SBP
   - Gentle IVF's with attention to respiratory status.
   .
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:  Most likely primary SBP given
   cell count profile.  He was started on meropenem and given albumin
   1.5mg/kg on [**5-27**].  Peritoneal fluid growing gram negative rods.
   - f/u speciation and sensitivity
   - continue meropenem and narrow once sensitivity returns
   - f/u hepatology recs -
 no need for further albumin
   - monitor renal function
   .
   # RLE infection: pt had a chronic RLE cellulitis and osteomyelitis
   secondary to a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open
   trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**], s/p 5 debridements
   and revisions with non healing R ankle wound during the last admission
   and was discharged to LTAC with vac dressing and on daptomycin and
   micafungin to treat VRE and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] until [**2120-5-26**]. He was seen
   in the ortho clinic on [**5-21**], and after the vac dressing was removed
   frank pus was seen. Patient is s/p I&D on [**5-24**]. In the OR, patient was
   noted to have good vessels, indicating good prognosis for eventual
   healing. External fixator removed and vac dressing placed.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin and micafungin for now
   - per ID recs during the last admission, pt needs qweek checks of cbc,
   diff, lft, bun, cr, cpk, esr, crp while on abx
   - f/u cultures
   - VAC change Q2D (today)
   - keep leg elevated
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Likely compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension.
   CXR ugly without focality.
   - Monitor volume status closely
   - sputum if able
   .
   # Neck Pain: Is not focal enough to be c/w epidural abscess although
   that is potential concern.  Would obtain CT c/t spine with contrast to
   evaluate for fracture/abscess or other abnormality.  Exam not c/w
   spinal infarct, and vascular dissection also inconsistent with current
   reproducible pain on exam.
   - pain control with morphine prn
   - warm compresses
   - lidocaine patch, Tylenol PRN, ultram PRN (will monitor BPs)
   .
   # Dobhoff dysfunction/Dysphagia and poor PO intake: Dobhoff working
   now.  Patient failed s/s and video swallow on [**5-22**] due to muscle
   weakness and aspirations. Dobhoff was placed on [**5-22**].
   - NPO
   - continue TF via dobhoff
   - appreciate nutrition recs
   - avoid TPN given liver issues
   - tongue sore: ice chips, viscous lidocaine prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Stable, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  [**Month (only) 11**] need repeat
   paracentesis, but no belly pain currently.
   - Place foley in the AM and check bladder pressure.
   - monitor mental status
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -  hold nadolol given hypotension.
   - titrate to [**4-11**] BM daily
   - continue PPI
   - monitor hct daily
   - LFT q2-3 days
   - F/U liver recs
   .
   # ESRD: due to hepatorenal syndrome, on HD with  TuThuSat schedule.
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue HD as tolerated by BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   - trend electrolytes
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   - continue calcium acetate
   - continue midodrine
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with extreme insulin resistence:
   - continue insulin
   - diabetic diet
   - FS QID
   .
   # Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue CPAP
   .
   # Depression:
   - continue escitalopram and bupropion
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely [**3-12**] cirrhosis
   - trend
   .

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing significant positional changes in blood pressure, indicating orthostatic hypotension. This could be due to missing midodrine doses and the use of nadolol. The low blood pressure may also be caused by abdominal distension impairing venous return.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient most likely has primary SBP, as indicated by the cell count profile in the peritoneal fluid. He has been started on meropenem and given albumin. Further speciation and sensitivity of the gram-negative rods should be done to guide antibiotic therapy.

3. RLE Infection: The patient has a chronic RLE cellulitis and osteomyelitis secondary to a traumatic RTibiotalar posterior dislocation and open trimalleolar fracture. The wound is non-healing, and pus was seen after removing the vac dressing. An incision and drainage were performed. Daptomycin and micafungin should be continued for now, and regular wound checks are recommended.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension. Close monitoring of volume status and sputum production is advised.

5. Neck Pain: The patient's neck pain does not appear to be focal enough to be consistent with an epidural abscess. However,"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to a gastrointestinal infection. The patient has been diagnosed with a gastrointestinal infection caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR), which has resulted in sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require ongoing monitoring and support. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and glucose levels. Imaging studies are pending. The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics, antifungal medication, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis secondary to the gastrointestinal infection. If not managed appropriately, sepsis can progress and lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The abnormalities in laboratory results, such as elevated creatinine and low platelet count, indicate potential organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Antibiotic Resistance: The presence of GNR in the peritoneal fluid without speciation/sensitivity suggests the possibility of antibiotic-resistant organisms. If the bacteria are resistant to the current antibiotics being administered, the infection may not be effectively treated, leading to persistent or worsening sepsis.
4. Nosocomial Infections: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with the following chief complaints: GNR in peritoneal cx, no change in ID, meropenem and daptomycin continued for late-growing anaerobes, RLE swab not deep and may not reflect pathogens, plans to wean Levophed but requirement increased, and added tylenol & Ultram for neck pain. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient received antibiotics including daptomycin, micafungin, and meropenem. They are also receiving lansoprazole, carafate, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data as of [2120-5-30] 06:54 AM shows vital signs with Tcurrent at 35.8 C (96.4 F), HR at 94 bpm, BP at 121/61 mmHg, RR at 20 insp/min, and SpO2 at 99%. The patient is on respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals an alert and oriented patient with no acute distress, a Dophoff tube in place, sclera anicteric, clear oropharynx, supple neck, no JVP elevation or LAD, clear lungs bilaterally, regular heart rhythm, normal S1 + S2,"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o M NASH cirrhosis c/b varices/ascites, ESRD on HD, and chronic
   wound infection now transferred to ICU with hypotension after HD and
   missing midodrine doses
   .
   #Hypotension/Shock:  Patient with baseline low blood pressure (SBP
   80-90s). Now with significant positional change in blood pressure
   consistent with orthostatic hypotension.  This is in the setting of
   missing midodrine due to blocked dophoff.  Nadolol could also be
   contributing to orthostasis.  Paracentesis with cell count profile c/w
   SBP.  Possible that abominal distension is impairing venous return and
   causing hypotension.  Adrenal insufficiency considered although AM
   cortisol within normal limits.
   - Continue midodrine via dobhoff
   - continue octreotide
   - continue Levophed with goal SBP > 85
   - hold nadolol
   - TTE
   - continue micafungin and daptomycin for foot wound and meropenem for
   SBP
   - Gentle IVF's with attention to respiratory status.
   .
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:  Most likely primary SBP given
   cell count profile.  He was started on meropenem and given albumin
   1.5mg/kg on [**5-27**].  Peritoneal fluid growing gram negative rods.
   - f/u speciation and sensitivity
   - continue meropenem and narrow once sensitivity returns
   - f/u hepatology recs -
 no need for further albumin
   - monitor renal function
   .
   # RLE infection: pt had a chronic RLE cellulitis and osteomyelitis
   secondary to a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open
   trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**], s/p 5 debridements
   and revisions with non healing R ankle wound during the last admission
   and was discharged to LTAC with vac dressing and on daptomycin and
   micafungin to treat VRE and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] until [**2120-5-26**]. He was seen
   in the ortho clinic on [**5-21**], and after the vac dressing was removed
   frank pus was seen. Patient is s/p I&D on [**5-24**]. In the OR, patient was
   noted to have good vessels, indicating good prognosis for eventual
   healing. External fixator removed and vac dressing placed.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin and micafungin for now
   - per ID recs during the last admission, pt needs qweek checks of cbc,
   diff, lft, bun, cr, cpk, esr, crp while on abx
   - f/u cultures
   - VAC change Q2D (today)
   - keep leg elevated
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Likely compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension.
   CXR ugly without focality.
   - Monitor volume status closely
   - sputum if able
   .
   # Neck Pain: Is not focal enough to be c/w epidural abscess although
   that is potential concern.  Would obtain CT c/t spine with contrast to
   evaluate for fracture/abscess or other abnormality.  Exam not c/w
   spinal infarct, and vascular dissection also inconsistent with current
   reproducible pain on exam.
   - pain control with morphine prn
   - warm compresses
   - lidocaine patch, Tylenol PRN, ultram PRN (will monitor BPs)
   .
   # Dobhoff dysfunction/Dysphagia and poor PO intake: Dobhoff working
   now.  Patient failed s/s and video swallow on [**5-22**] due to muscle
   weakness and aspirations. Dobhoff was placed on [**5-22**].
   - NPO
   - continue TF via dobhoff
   - appreciate nutrition recs
   - avoid TPN given liver issues
   - tongue sore: ice chips, viscous lidocaine prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Stable, followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  [**Month (only) 11**] need repeat
   paracentesis, but no belly pain currently.
   - Place foley in the AM and check bladder pressure.
   - monitor mental status
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -  hold nadolol given hypotension.
   - titrate to [**4-11**] BM daily
   - continue PPI
   - monitor hct daily
   - LFT q2-3 days
   - F/U liver recs
   .
   # ESRD: due to hepatorenal syndrome, on HD with TuThuSat schedule.
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue HD as tolerated by BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   - trend electrolytes
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   - continue calcium acetate
   - continue midodrine
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with extreme insulin resistance:
   - continue insulin
   - diabetic diet
   - FS QID
   .
   # Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue CPAP
   .
   # Depression:
   - continue escitalopram and bupropion
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely [**3-12**] cirrhosis
   - trend
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, continue tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, PICC.

   secondary to a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open
   trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**], s/p 5 debridements
   and revisions with non healing R ankle wound during the last admission

   micafungin to treat VRE and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] until [**2120-5-26**]. He was seen
   in the ortho clinic on [**5-21**], and after the vac dressing was removed
   frank pus was seen. Patient is s/p I&D on [**5-24**]. In the OR, patient was
   noted to have good vessels, indicating good prognosis for eventual
   healing. External fixator removed and vac dressing placed.
   - f/u ortho surgery recs
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue daptomycin and micafungin for now
   - per ID recs during the last admission, pt needs qweek (thurs) checks

   # Neck Pain: Is not focal enough to be c/w epidural abscess although
   that is potential concern.  Would obtain CT c/t spine with contrast to
   evaluate for fracture/abscess or other abnormality.  Exam not c/w
   spinal infarct, and vascular dissection also inconsistent with current
   reproducible pain on exam.
   - pain control with morphine prn
   - warm compresses
   - lidocaine patch, Tylenol PRN, ultram PRN (will monitor BPs)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, chronic wound infection, ESRD on HD, and chronic leg infection. He was transferred to the ICU with hypotension after HD and missing midodrine doses. The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is experiencing orthostatic hypotension. He also has an elevated heart rate.

The patient has been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and is being treated with meropenem. His peritoneal fluid is growing gram-negative rods, and further speciation and sensitivity testing is needed.

He also has a chronic RLE infection, which was debrided and treated with daptomycin and micafungin. The patient underwent an I&D procedure, and his external fixator was removed. He will continue to receive daptomycin and micafungin for now.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxemia, likely due to compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension. Monitoring his respiratory status closely is recommended.

The patient complains of neck pain, which is not focal enough to be concerned with an epidural abscess. A CT c/t spine with contrast is advised to evaluate for fracture/abscess or other abnormality.

He has dysphagia and poor PO intake, and a Dobhoff tube has been placed. The patient's nutrition needs to be closely monitored, and he should avoid TPN due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a medical history of cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HOTN) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including daptomycin, meropenem, and micafungin. He is currently on norepinephrine infusion and other ICU medications.

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/62 mmHg to 129/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient appears to be in no acute distress.

Physical examination reveals crackles at the lung bases, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to unknown reason. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's conditions include cirrhosis, ESRD, HOTN, SBP, and potential adrenal insufficiency. The plan includes continuing lactulose for cirrhosis, meropenem for resistant E. coli causing SBP, and hemodialysis for ESRD. The patient will continue to receive ICU care, including nutrition support and glycemic control"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with hepatorenal syndrome (HOTN) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 122/62 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics for SBP, lactulose for cirrhosis, and dialysis for ESRD. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and liver enzymes, but his electrolytes and kidney function tests are within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome (HOTN) - This is a serious complication of cirrhosis that causes kidney failure. Close monitoring of the patient's renal function and adjustment of treatment accordingly will be important.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) - The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy for SBP. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis will be crucial.
3. Cirrhosis - The patient's liver disease may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or variceal bleeding. Regular monitoring of liver function and administration of lactulose to prevent hepatic encephalopathy will be necessary.
4. End-stage renal disease (ES"
