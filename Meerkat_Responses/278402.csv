   Assessment and Plan
   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR - likely etiology is diverticulosis given similar presentation
   in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. Other possibilities
   include mesenteric ischemia, malignancy, hemorrhoids.  No evidence of
   UGI source given overall stability and negative NGL.  Patient was
   transiently hypotensive but responded well to IVF. Patient went
   emergently to angio but no bleed was identified. Yesterday, she
   received a colonoscopy which showed old blood, multiple diverticuli but
   no clear source of bleed.
   - active type and screen
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - consider CTA abd/pel to evaluate for mesenteric ischemia, though
   diverticulosis more likely source at current time.
   - cont to hold warfarin, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K, profilnine.
   - transfuse PRBC liberally despite diastolic heart failure given fast
   rate of losses with plans to transition to ventilator if needed for
   respiratory support.
   - Q8H HCT
   - GI, surgery, IR following.
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   If brisk, patient may require surgery
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses.
   - Serial enzymes.
   - discuss with cards.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   .
   # Chronic dHF- last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - can rest on vent if needed.
   - lasix prn to even out fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure
   with OSA, CHF, also ?reactive component on multiple nebs.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   - Volume status as above.
   - Repeat film in AM and likely again following diuresis to eval for
   possible infiltrate, as was having increasing O2 requirements at rehab
   prior to transfer.
   - Sputum culture; cover vanc and zosyn for now given HD instability,
   questionable appearance of CXR and report of increased sputum, and
   bandemia.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin and reverse INR.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistent
   organisms.
   - Zosyn for now and followup cultures.
   .
   # Diabetes- seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications
   on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III, baseline 1.5.
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives overnight.
   - avoid overdiuresis in next few days given angio and contrast exposure
   overnight.
   .
   # Access- 2 18 g PIV.  PICC (?PICC - not seen on film) not flushing
   currently, will try TPA, low threshold to place TLC or Cordis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU with rectal bleeding and diagnosed with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). The source of bleeding could not be identified through colonoscopy or angiography. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and requires fluid resuscitation. She also has an elevated troponin level, indicating possible myocardial injury, and is showing signs of bradycardia. The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating due to multifactorial causes such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CHF, and possible reactive airway. She has been placed on invasive ventilation. The patient's blood cultures show bandemia, indicating a potential infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Given the history of LGIB and failure to identify the source of bleeding, there is a high risk of re-bleeding.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The combination of CHF, hypotension, and elevated troponin levels suggests a risk of cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and she may progress to hypercarbic respiratory failure due to OSA, CHF, and reactive airway.
4. Infection: The presence of bandemia and increased sputum production"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight male with no acute distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/42 to 159/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently in a first-degree AV block and receiving dopamine at a rate of 2.5 mcg/kg/min. The patient has undergone several procedures, including colonoscopy, endoscopy, and invasive ventilation. The patient is also receiving multiple medications, including pantoprazole, fentanyl, and midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This can be caused by various factors such as hemorrhage, heart failure, or septic shock.
2. Hypokalemia (low potassium, hypopotassemia): The patient's potassium level is low, which can lead to muscle weakness, irregular heart rhythms, and other complications.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has diffuse mild TTP (pressure ulcers), which can increase the risk of infection and delayed wound healing.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed, other (GI bleed, GIB): The patient experienced an angio without revealing the source of bleed, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. This can lead to significant blood loss"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity. He underwent colonoscopy and endoscopy on [**2117-4-2**] and has been on invasive ventilation since [**2117-4-3**] 04:10 AM. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 120/42 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 68 bpm, and normal oxygen saturation at 100%. His heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block. The patient has been receiving dopamine at a rate of 2.5 mcg/kg/min since becoming bradycardic and going into junctional rhythm. He has also been receiving various medications including erythromycin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, which can result in muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory difficulties.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.

   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR - likely etiology is diverticulosis given similar presentation
   in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No evidence of UGI
   source given overall stability and negative NGL.  Patient was
   hypotensive but has responded well to IVFthough now on dopamine
   overnight. Patient initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was
   identified. Yesterday, she received a colonoscopy which showed old
   blood, multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleed. Not a good
   surgical candidate if rebleeds.
   - active type and screen
   - 2 large bore PIV and midline in place
   - cont to hold warfarin, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K, profilnine.
   - transfuse PRBC as needed.
   - Q12H HCT
   - GI, surgery, IR following.
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF, also ?reactive component on multiple nebs. Now CXR overnight
   appears much worse with left-sided white-out, possibly collapse, also
   concerning for perforated esophagus.
   - CT chest with gastrograffin PO contrast
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   - Volume status as above.
   - Sputum culture; cover vanc and zosyn for now given HD instability,
   questionable appearance of CXR and report of increased sputum.
   - increase PEEP to 10 to maintain patent airways
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   Now on dopamine due to hypotension and bradycardia. Concerning these
   symptoms could be related to new lung process
   - discuss with cards.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   - consider ECHO
   .
   # Chronic dHF- last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistent
   organisms.
   - Zosyn for now and followup cultures.
   .
   # Diabetes- seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications
   on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III, baseline 1.5. Currently 1.2
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives.
   - avoid overdiuresis in next few days given angio and contrast exposure
   overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She presented to the hospital with rectal bleeding and was found to have lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) with no clear source identified. She underwent an angiogram but no bleeding source was found. Subsequently, she had a colonoscopy which revealed multiple diverticuli and old blood but still no clear source of bleeding. The patient became bradycardic, hypotensive, and required dopamine support. She also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in 2011. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's history of LGIB and the presence of multiple diverticuli increase the risk of rebleeding. Close monitoring and transfusion of PRBCs as needed are important.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), and possibly a reactive component on multiple nebs. The worsening CXR with left-sided white-out suggests a possible lung collapse or perforated esophagus. Further evaluation with a CT chest with gastrograffin PO contrast is recommended.
3. Bradycardia/NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels have increased, indicating a possible myocardial infarction. Close monitoring and discussion"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient underwent colonoscopy and endoscopy, which showed no active bleeding. However, the patient experienced hypotension and bradycardia overnight, leading to the initiation of dopamine infusion. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/64 mmHg to 159/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation support with a tracheostomy tube and is on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode. The FiO2 is set at 50% and PEEP is at 5 cmH2O.

Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese general appearance, diminished breath sounds on respiratory/chest examination, soft non-tender non-distended abdomen, and edema in both extremities. Neurologic assessment could not be performed due to the patient's unconscious state.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 166 K/uL, platelet count of 200 K/uL, blood glucose level of 142 mg/dL, sodium level of 127 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and a lactate level of 0.8 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of lower gastrointestinal (LGI) bleed. The patient underwent several procedures including colonoscopy and endoscopy, which showed diverticuli but no active bleeding. The patient also required invasive ventilation due to respiratory issues. The patient experienced hypotension and bradycardia overnight, for which dopamine was started. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/64 mmHg to 159/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and received various medications such as erythromycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, dopamine, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and midazolam.

The patient's review of systems and flow sheet data are relatively stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure and fluid balance. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and autoflow, a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory system compliance of 36.4 cmH2O/mL, and an ABG showing pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 344.

   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR - likely etiology is diverticulosis given similar presentation
   in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No evidence of UGI
   source given overall stability and negative NGL.  Patient was
   hypotensive but has responded well to IVFthough now on dopamine
   overnight. Patient initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was
   identified. Yesterday, she received a colonoscopy which showed old
   blood, multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleed. Not a good
   surgical candidate if rebleeds.  Remains with stable HCT x24hrs
   post-bleed.
   - active type and screen
   - 2 large bore PIV and midline in place
   - cont to hold warfarin, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K, profilnine.
   - transfuse PRBC as needed.
   - Q12H HCT
   - GI, IR following.
   - Surgery recs not an operative candidate
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with hypotension that persists despite adequate
   fluid recuscitation.  Remains on dopamine at low dose.  Does not appear
   to have septic shock, unclear etiology of persistent hypotension.
   - cont dopamine for now, wean as tolerated
   - echo today
   - will hold off diuresis now.
   - will check random cortisol
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF, also ?reactive component on multiple nebs. Now CXR overnight
   appears much worse with left-sided white-out, possibly collapse, also
   concerning for perforated esophagus. CT chest without e/o esophageal
   perforation, LLL atelectasis vs collapse but L lung expanded, sm pl
   effusion, large heart, contrast from angio noted in kidney, radiology
   recs rad definition of ATN.  CT chest not c/w CXR done earlier AM.  CXR
   this AM with improved L lung field
   - daily CXR
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   - Volume status as above.
   - CT chest without suggestion of consolidation, does not appear to have
   PNA.
   - d/c vanco at this point.
   - cont PEEP to 10 to maintain patent airways
   - will wean vent today to PS [**10-2**] at 40%FiO2.
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   Now on dopamine due to hypotension and bradycardia. Concerning these
   symptoms could be related to new lung process
   - discuss with cards.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   - await ECHO
   .
   # Chronic dHF- last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistent
   organisms.
   - Zosyn for now and followup cultures.
   .
   # Diabetes- seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications
   on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III, baseline 1.5. Currently 1.2
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives.
   - per radiology, CT chest with e/o possible ATN due to decreased
   clearance of contrast dye
   - avoid overdiuresis in next few days given angio and contrast exposure
   overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. The patient presents with rectal bleeding and was found to have lower gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR) due to diverticulosis. The source of bleeding could not be identified during a colonoscopy, and the patient is not considered a good surgical candidate if rebleeds occur.

The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Dopamine is being used at a low dose to maintain blood pressure. The patient's respiratory status is concerning for multifactorial respiratory failure, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), and possible reactive component. A chest X-ray revealed a left-sided whiteout, possibly indicating lung collapse. A CT scan of the chest showed left lower lobe atelectasis versus collapse and a small pleural effusion. The patient's heart is enlarged, and there is contrast from angiography noted in the kidneys, raising concerns for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, but there was a troponin bump to 0.13, which may be related to large gastrointestinal losses. The patient is on dopamine due to hypotension and bradycardia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. 

24-hour events include the recommendation against surgery, ordering an echocardiogram, and performing a chest X-ray and CT scan of the left lower lobe showing atelectasis versus collapse. The patient's radial artery catheterization was removed due to lack of pulse, and a new arterial line was placed. 

The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 51-76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 87/39 to 134/64 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,816 mL and output of 723 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,093 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count of 180 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/d"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR - likely etiology is diverticulosis given similar presentation
   in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No evidence of UGI
   source given overall stability and negative NGL.  Patient was
   hypotensive but has responded well to IVFthough now on dopamine
   overnight. Patient initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was
   identified. Yesterday, she received a colonoscopy which showed old
   blood, multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleed. Not a good
   surgical candidate if rebleeds.
   - active type and screen
   - 2 large bore PIV and midline in place
   - cont to hold warfarin, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K, profilnine.
   - transfuse PRBC as needed.
   - Q12H HCT
   - GI, IR following.
   - Surgery recs not an operative candidate
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF, also ?reactive component on multiple nebs. Now CXR overnight
   appears much worse with left-sided white-out, possibly collapse, also
   concerning for perforated esophagus. CT chest without e/o esophageal
   perforation, LLL atelectasis vs collapse but L lung expanded, sm pl
   effusion, large heart, contrast from angio noted in kidney, radiology
   recs rad definition of ATN.  CT chest not c/w CXR done earlier AM.
   - daily CXR
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   - Volume status as above.
   - Sputum culture; cover vanc and zosyn for now given HD instability,
   questionable appearance of CXR and report of increased sputum.
   - cont PEEP to 10 to maintain patent airways
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   Now on dopamine due to hypotension and bradycardia. Concerning these
   symptoms could be related to new lung process
   - discuss with cards.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   - await ECHO
   .
   # Chronic dHF- last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistent
   organisms.
   - Zosyn for now and followup cultures.
   .
   # Diabetes- seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications
   on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III, baseline 1.5. Currently 1.2
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives.
   - avoid overdiuresis in next few days given angio and contrast exposure
   overnight.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She presented to the ICU with rectal bleeding and was found to have a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely due to diverticulosis. The patient initially went emergently to angiography but no bleed was identified. She received a colonoscopy which showed old blood and multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleed. The patient is not considered a good surgical candidate if rebleeds occur.

The patient also has respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in origin due to OSA, CHF, and possibly a reactive component on multiple nebs. The chest X-ray (CXR) overnight appears much worse with left-sided white-out, possibly collapse, and there is concern for perforated esophagus. However, the CT chest without evidence of esophageal perforation, left lower lobe atelectasis vs collapse, but the left lung is expanded with a small pleural effusion, large heart, contrast from angiography noted in the kidney, and radiology recommends rad definition of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The CT chest does not correlate with the earlier CXR.

The patient's cardiac enzymes have shown a Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK, likely due to demand in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an obese individual who is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. They have been experiencing hypotension and bradycardia, which are thought to be related to respiratory issues. The patient also has signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected to be lower GI bleed, as well as renal insufficiency. They are being treated with antibiotics for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) and are on pressors to stabilize their blood pressure. The patient's condition appears to be improving, with better aeration of the left lung on chest X-ray. They have bibasilar atelectasis on chest CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a need to wean them off the ventilator and try tracheostomy mask trials. If not managed properly, this can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential pneumonia.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has signs of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires further investigation and management to prevent further blood loss and potential shock.
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is compromised, and it is essential to monitor their kidney function closely and ensure adequate hydration to prevent further deterioration.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: Although the patient is on antibiotics, there is still a risk of UTI due to the urinary catheter in place. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory failure and hypotension. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. On the first day, he received erythromycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin for suspected pneumonia. His vital signs were stable, with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 133/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient was on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. His ABG results showed a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 248, and oxygen consumption of 6.4 L/min.

On the second day, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 70/35 mmHg, and he developed bradycardia with a heart rate of 49 bpm. His arterial blood gases indicated hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 124 mmHg and hypercapnia with a PaCO2 of 26 mmHg. The patient's white blood cell count increased from 10.8 K/uL to 18 K/uL, and his hemoglobin decreased from 9.3 g/dL to 8.9 g/dL. His platelet count remained within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.5 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 5.3 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) at 135 mEq/L, and chloride (Cl-) at 102 mEq/L. His blood glucose level was within normal range at 118 mg/dL. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.1, prothrombin time (PT) was 13.4 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was 29.9 seconds.

The patient's chest X-ray showed white out of the left lung field, which could indicate either collapse or effusion. The physician is concerned about the possibility of esophageal trauma. A chest CT scan has been ordered to further evaluate the situation.

The patient has been placed on dopamine infusion to support his blood pressure and is receiving appropriate antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. His arterial line was placed on the second day, and he has been given a total of 4,816 mL of fluids since midnight. The patient's urine output has been stable at 723 mL over the past 24 hours. His temperature has been within normal range at 36.2°C (97.1°F).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure could be due to pneumonia or other causes. The presence of white out in the left lung field on the chest X-ray raises concerns about collapse or effusion. Further evaluation with a chest CT scan is needed to determine the cause and guide appropriate management.
2. Hypotension and Bradyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU, requiring mechanical ventilation and pressors to maintain blood pressure. They have a tracheostomy tube in place for respiratory support. The patient's vital signs show stable heart rate, blood pressure within normal range, and good oxygen saturation. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is suspected to be lower GI bleeding. The patient is on multiple antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). There are concerns about renal insufficiency and potential complications such as hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently on pressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating that they are experiencing hypotension. If the pressors are not adjusted properly, it can lead to further drops in blood pressure.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has a low heart rate, which can be related to respiratory issues or medication side effects. Monitoring the EKG is important to assess any changes or potential worsening of bradycardia.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a suspected lower GI bleed. If left untreated, it can lead to significant blood loss, anemia, and shock.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to underlying respiratory issues. Failure to wean off the ventilator can result in prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR
 Admission for BRBPR with hypotension and respiratory failure,
   likely diverticular bleed, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K,
   profilnine.  Patient given 6units PRBC total for GI bleed, 3units on
   admission and 3units the following day with stable HCT during hospital
   course.  Likely etiology determined to be diverticulosis given similar
   presentation in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No
   evidence of UGI source given overall stability and negative NGL.
   Patient was hypotensive intitially, responded well to IVF, but then was
   placed on dopamine overnight of admission for BP support. Patient
   initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was identified. A
   colonoscopy was done which showed old blood, multiple diverticuli but
   no clear source of bleed. Surgery recommended that patient is not a
   good surgical candidate if rebleeds.  Patient remained with stable HCT
   x24hrs post-bleed and serial HCT values were stable.  IR was following
   patient and felt that no further intervention was needed given stable
   HCT since angio.  GI felt that patient
   - cont to hold warfarin
   - GI, IR following.
   - Surgery recs not an operative candidate
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with hypotension upon admission in conjunction
   with GI bleed that persisted despite adequate fluid recuscitation.
   Patient was on dopamine for three days after bleed but was weaned off
   of dopamine on HD3 without complications or need for reinitiation of
   dopamine.  Echo done on [**4-5**] with markedly dilated, hypokinetic right
   ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation that is directed towards
   the inter-atrial septum. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
   with pressure/volume overload of the left ventricle. Left ventricular
   function with EF>55%.  Echo determined to be related to overall fluid
   positive status for LOS due to pressors/fluid recuscitation/blood
   products given for GI bleed.  Random cortisol level 14, TSH 0.3
   - will start to diurese as BP tolerates as pt fluid positive for LOS.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF exacerbation related to fluid recuscitation for GI bleed.   Patient
   on admission requiring placement on ventilator for respiratory
   support.  CXR done on HD 1 AM with left-sided chest white-out, possibly
   collapse.  A CT chest was done for futher evaluation which was without
   e/o esophageal perforation, LLL atelectasis/collapse but with L lung
   expanded, a small plueral.  The patients AM CXR continued to improve
   daily as she was weaned off pressors, continued on
   albuterol/ipratropium and decreased on her overall fluid intake.  On HD
   3 she was weaned off vent to trach collar successfully without further
   ventilator support requirements.
   - daily CXR
   - cont trach collar
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   Now on dopamine due to hypotension and bradycardia. Concerning these
   symptoms could be related to new lung process
   - discuss with cards.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   - await ECHO
   .
   # Chronic dHF- last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistant
   organisms.  Ucx with E.coli sensitive to zosyn, cipro, CTX, [**Last Name (un) 430**], was
   switched from zosyn to cipro on [**4-4**] after sensitivities back.
   - cont cipro for 10d course for complicated UTI
   .
   # Diabetes- seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications
   on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III, baseline 1.5. Currently 1.3 at baseline.
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives.
   - per radiology, CT chest with e/o possible ATN due to decreased
   clearance of contrast dye
   - avoid overdiuresis in next few days given angio and contrast exposure
   overnight.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the hospital with rectal bleeding and was found to have a gastrointestinal bleed likely due to diverticulosis. The patient received blood transfusions and fluid resuscitation but remained hypotensive and required dopamine support.

The patient's condition worsened, leading to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. A CT scan of the chest ruled out esophageal perforation or large pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram revealed severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.

The patient's bradycardia and elevated troponin levels suggested possible myocardial ischemia, but cardiac enzymes trended down, and the patient was weaned off dopamine. His fluid status remained positive due to ongoing losses, and diuresis was initiated to manage his congestive heart failure.

The patient also had a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Antibiotics were adjusted accordingly. His diabetes appeared to be diet-controlled, and sliding scale insulin was used for glycemic control. Chronic kidney disease was present, and antihypertensive medications were held due to concerns about renal function.

The patient's recent medical history includes an episode of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in"

","Summary:
The patient in the ICU was previously on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. However, due to ABG results showing a pH of 7.34 and high carbon dioxide levels, the decision was made to continue tracheostomy mask ventilation. Dopamine infusion was also discontinued. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/68 to 147/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a first-degree AV block. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,154 mL and output of 850 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 304 mL. Respiratory support continues with tracheostomy mask ventilation, set at a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O.

   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR
 Admission for BRBPR with hypotension and respiratory failure,
   likely diverticular bleed, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K,
   profilnine.  Patient given 6units PRBC total for GI bleed, 3units on
   admission and 3units the following day with stable HCT during hospital
   course.  Likely etiology determined to be diverticulosis given similar
   presentation in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No
   evidence of UGI source given overall stability and negative NGL.
   Patient was hypotensive intitially, responded well to IVF, but then was
   placed on dopamine overnight of admission for BP support. Patient
   initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was identified. A
   colonoscopy was done which showed old blood, multiple diverticuli but
   no clear source of bleed. Surgery recommended that patient is not a
   good surgical candidate if rebleeds.  Patient remained with stable HCT
   x24hrs post-bleed and serial HCT values were stable.  IR was following
   patient and felt that no further intervention was needed given stable
   HCT since angio.  Warfarin was held during hospital course.
   - cont to hold warfarin
   - GI, IR following.
   - Surgery recs not an operative candidate
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with hypotension upon admission in conjunction
   with GI bleed that persisted despite adequate fluid recuscitation.
   Patient was on dopamine for three days after bleed but was weaned off
   of dopamine on HD3 without complications or need for reinitiation of
   dopamine.  Echo done on [**4-5**] with markedly dilated, hypokinetic right
   ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation that is directed towards
   the inter-atrial septum. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
   with pressure/volume overload of the left ventricle. Left ventricular
   function with EF>55%.  Echo determined to be related to overall fluid
   positive status for LOS due to pressors/fluid recuscitation/blood
   products given for GI bleed.  Random cortisol level 14, TSH 0.3.
   - will start to diurese as BP tolerates as pt fluid positive for LOS.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF exacerbation related to fluid recuscitation for GI bleed.   Patient
   on admission requiring placement on ventilator for respiratory
   support.  CXR done on HD 1 AM with left-sided chest white-out, possibly
   collapse.  A CT chest was done for futher evaluation which was without
   e/o esophageal perforation, LLL atelectasis/collapse but with L lung
   expanded, a small plueral.  The patients AM CXR continued to improve
   daily as she was weaned off pressors, continued on
   albuterol/ipratropium and decreased on her overall fluid intake.  On HD
   3 she was weaned off vent to trach collar successfully without further
   ventilator support requirements.
   - daily CXR
   - cont trach collar
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trended down
   during hospital course and there was no further conern for cardiac
   ischemia.  Echo performed on HD4 as discussed above.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   .
   # Chronic dHF- Last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%.
   Due to hypotension requiring dopamine during hospital course, patient
   was held on her home lasix and lisinopril.  Echo done on [**4-5**] with
   markedly dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid
   regurgitation that is directed towards the inter-atrial septum. Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with pressure/volume overload of
   the left ventricle. Left ventricular function with EF>55%.  Due to
   hypotension and
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistant
   organisms.  U/A on admission concerning for UTI.  She was started
   empirically on zosyn on admission given exposures.  Subsequent Ucx from
   ED on [**4-1**] with E.coli sensitive to zosyn, cipro, CTX, [**Last Name (un) 430**].  She was
   switched from zosyn to cipro on [**4-4**] after sensitivities back.  She
   will complete a full 10 day course.
   - cont cipro for 10d course for complicated UTI

   # Diabetes-  Seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes
   medications on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%.  Her blood
   glucose was well controlled on sliding scale insulin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and obesity. She presented to the ICU with rectal bleeding, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The bleeding was likely due to diverticulosis, as indicated by previous colonoscopy findings. The patient received blood transfusions and fluid resuscitation but remained hypotensive initially. She was started on dopamine for blood pressure support and underwent an angiogram, which did not reveal any active bleeding. A colonoscopy showed old blood and multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleeding. Surgery recommended that the patient is not a good surgical candidate, and interventional radiology (IR) agreed that no further intervention was needed given the stable hematocrit levels since the angiogram. Warfarin was held during the hospital course.

The patient experienced multifactorial respiratory failure due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CHF exacerbation related to fluid resuscitation for the GI bleed, and possibly left lung collapse.

   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR - likely etiology is diverticulosis given similar presentation
   in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No evidence of UGI
   source given overall stability and negative NGL.  Patient was
   hypotensive but has responded well to IVFthough now on dopamine
   overnight. Patient initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was
   identified. Yesterday, she received a colonoscopy which showed old
   blood, multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleed. Not a good
   surgical candidate if rebleeds.  Remains with stable HCT x24hrs
   post-bleed.
   - active type and screen
   - 2 large bore PIV and midline in place
   - cont to hold warfarin, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K, profilnine.
   - transfuse PRBC as needed.
   - Q12H HCT
   - GI, IR following.
   - Surgery recs not an operative candidate
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with hypotension that persists despite adequate
   fluid recuscitation.  Remains on dopamine at low dose.  Does not appear
   to have septic shock, unclear etiology of persistent hypotension.
   - cont dopamine for now, wean as tolerated
   - echo today
   - will hold off diuresis now.
   - will check random cortisol
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF, also ?reactive component on multiple nebs. Now CXR overnight
   appears much worse with left-sided white-out, possibly collapse, also
   concerning for perforated esophagus. CT chest without e/o esophageal
   perforation, LLL atelectasis vs collapse but L lung expanded, sm pl
   effusion, large heart, contrast from angio noted in kidney, radiology
   recs rad definition of ATN.  CT chest not c/w CXR done earlier AM.  CXR
   this AM with improved L lung field
   - daily CXR
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
   - Volume status as above.
   - CT chest without suggestion of consolidation, does not appear to have
   PNA.
   - d/c vanco at this point.
   - cont PEEP to 10 to maintain patent airways
   - cont trach collar
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   Now on dopamine due to hypotension and bradycardia. Concerning these
   symptoms could be related to new lung process
   - discuss with cards.
   - Adequate transfusion resuscitation.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   - await ECHO
   .
   # Chronic dHF- last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistent
   organisms.
   - Zosyn for now and followup cultures.
   .
   # Diabetes- seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes medications
   on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III, baseline 1.5. Currently 1.2
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives.
   - per radiology, CT chest with e/o possible ATN due to decreased
   clearance of contrast dye
   - avoid overdiuresis in next few days given angio and contrast exposure
   overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of multiple myeloma, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, diverticulosis, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She presented with rectal bleeding and was found to have a lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) due to diverticulosis. The patient underwent a colonoscopy which revealed old blood and multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleeding. She is currently on invasive ventilation and has been weaned off dopamine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a possible reactive component. There is concern for lung collapse and perforated esophagus, but a CT chest did not show evidence of esophageal perforation. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of respiratory support.

2. Hypotension: Despite adequate fluid resuscitation, the patient persists with hypotension. The cause of this persistent hypotension is unclear. The patient is currently on dopamine at a low dose, and further evaluation with an echocardiogram is planned.

3. Bradycardia/NSTEMI: The patient experienced a troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK levels, suggesting a possible demand ischemia in the setting of large gastrointestinal losses. Cardiac enzymes are trending down, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight individual in the ICU with no known drug allergies. They have been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Ciprofloxacin), pantoprazole, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. They have a first-degree AV block and are on respiratory support with a tracheostomy mask. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, mild TTP in the abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

Lab results show elevated potassium levels, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and has had some blood product transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged First-Degree AV Block: The presence of a first-degree AV block indicates a delay in the electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles of the heart. If this condition worsens or is accompanied by other cardiac abnormalities, it may lead to bradycardia, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's use of a tracheostomy mask for respiratory support increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Proper suctioning and hygiene practices should be implemented to minimize this risk.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR
 Admission for BRBPR with hypotension and respiratory failure,
   likely diverticular bleed, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K,
   profilnine.  Patient given 6units PRBC total for GI bleed, 3units on
   admission and 3units the following day with stable HCT during hospital
   course.  Likely etiology determined to be diverticulosis given similar
   presentation in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No
   evidence of UGI source given overall stability and negative NGL.
   Patient was hypotensive intitially, responded well to IVF, but then was
   placed on dopamine overnight of admission for BP support. Patient
   initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was identified. A
   colonoscopy was done which showed old blood, multiple diverticuli but
   no clear source of bleed. Surgery recommended that patient is not a
   good surgical candidate if rebleeds.  Patient remained with stable HCT
   x24hrs post-bleed and serial HCT values were stable.  IR was following
   patient and felt that no further intervention was needed given stable
   HCT since angio.  Warfarin was held during hospital course.
   - cont to hold warfarin
   - GI, IR following, patient stable
   - Surgery recs not an operative candidate
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with hypotension upon admission in conjunction
   with GI bleed that persisted despite adequate fluid recuscitation.
   Patient was on dopamine for three days after bleed but was weaned off
   of dopamine on HD3 without complications or need for reinitiation of
   dopamine.  Echo done on [**4-5**] with markedly dilated, hypokinetic right
   ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation that is directed towards
   the inter-atrial septum. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
   with pressure/volume overload of the left ventricle. Left ventricular
   function with EF>55%.  Echo determined to be related to overall fluid
   positive status for LOS due to pressors/fluid recuscitation/blood
   products given for GI bleed.  Random cortisol level 14, TSH 0.3.
   - cont lasix diuresis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF exacerbation related to fluid recuscitation for GI bleed.   Patient
   on admission requiring placement on ventilator for respiratory
   support.  CXR done on HD 1 AM with left-sided chest white-out, possibly
   collapse.  A CT chest was done for futher evaluation which was without
   e/o esophageal perforation, LLL atelectasis/collapse but with L lung
   expanded, a small plueral.  The patients AM CXR continued to improve
   daily as she was weaned off pressors, continued on
   albuterol/ipratropium and decreased on her overall fluid intake.  On HD
   3 she was weaned off vent to trach collar successfully without further
   ventilator support requirements.
   - daily CXR
   - cont trach collar, currently stable
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trended down
   during hospital course and there was no further conern for cardiac
   ischemia.  Echo performed on HD4 as discussed above.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   .
   # Chronic dHF- Last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%.
   Due to hypotension requiring dopamine during hospital course, patient
   was held on her home lasix and lisinopril.  Echo done on [**4-5**] with
   markedly dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid
   regurgitation that is directed towards the inter-atrial septum. Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with pressure/volume overload of
   the left ventricle. Left ventricular function with EF>55%.  Due to
   hypotension and
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistant
   organisms.  U/A on admission concerning for UTI.  She was started
   empirically on zosyn on admission given exposures.  Subsequent Ucx from
   ED on [**4-1**] with E.coli sensitive to zosyn, cipro, CTX, [**Last Name (un) 430**].  She was
   switched from zosyn to cipro on [**4-4**] after sensitivities back.  She
   will complete a full 7 day course.
   - cont cipro for 7d course for complicated UTI
   .
   # Diabetes-  Seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes
   medications on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%.  Her blood
   glucose was well controlled on sliding scale insulin.
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III - Baseline 1.2-1.5.  During admission, Cr from 1.1 on
   admission with rise to 1.5 and then trended down to baseline range.
   Patient started back on lasix on HD 4.
   - holding lisinopril and antihypertensives.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including dilated cardiomyopathy (dHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III.
- The patient presented with rectal bleeding and was admitted for bloody rectal bleeding with hypotension and respiratory failure, likely due to diverticular bleeding.
- Initial interventions included fluid resuscitation, transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and administration of vitamin K and profinine.
- The patient was initially hypotensive but responded well to intravenous fluids (IVF). However, she required dopamine for blood pressure support overnight.
- Angiography was performed but did not reveal any active bleeding. Colonoscopy showed old blood and multiple diverticuli but no clear source of bleeding.
- Surgery was recommended, but the patient was deemed not a good surgical candidate. Interventions were focused on conservative management, including holding warfarin, close monitoring of fluid balance, and use of tracheostomy.
- The patient developed hypotension upon admission, which persisted despite adequate fluid resuscitation. She required dopamine for three days but was weaned off without complications.
- A transthoracic echo (TTE) revealed a markedly dilated, hypokinetic right vent"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 F with MMP including dHF, OSA, s/p trach, HTN, DM, atrial
   fibrillation on warfarin, history of LGIB [**1-25**] diverticulosis in [**2111**]
   presents with rectal bleeding.
   .
   # BRBPR
 Admission for BRBPR with hypotension and respiratory failure,
   likely diverticular bleed, s/p reversal with FFP, vitamin K,
   profilnine.  Patient given 6units PRBC total for GI bleed, 3units on
   admission and 3units the following day with stable HCT during hospital
   course.  Likely etiology determined to be diverticulosis given similar
   presentation in [**2111**] where colonoscopy showed diverticulosis. No
   evidence of UGI source given overall stability and negative NGL.
   Patient was hypotensive intitially, responded well to IVF, but then was
   placed on dopamine overnight of admission for BP support. Patient
   initially went emergently to angio but no bleed was identified. A
   colonoscopy was done which showed old blood, multiple diverticuli but
   no clear source of bleed. Surgery recommended that patient is not a
   good surgical candidate if rebleeds.  Patient remained with stable HCT
   x24hrs post-bleed and serial HCT values were stable.  IR was following
   patient and felt that no further intervention was needed given stable
   HCT since angio.  Warfarin was held during hospital course.
   - cont to hold warfarin
   - GI, IR following, patient stable
   - Surgery recs not an operative candidate
   - if rebleeds, would try to get tagged red-cell scan and repeat angio.
   Patient is not a good surgery candidate.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with hypotension upon admission in conjunction
   with GI bleed that persisted despite adequate fluid recuscitation.
   Patient was on dopamine for three days after bleed but was weaned off
   of dopamine on HD3 without complications or need for reinitiation of
   dopamine.  Echo done on [**4-5**] with markedly dilated, hypokinetic right
   ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation that is directed towards
   the inter-atrial septum. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
   with pressure/volume overload of the left ventricle. Left ventricular
   function with EF>55%.  Echo determined to be related to overall fluid
   positive status for LOS due to pressors/fluid recuscitation/blood
   products given for GI bleed.  Random cortisol level 14, TSH 0.3.
   - cont lasix diuresis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Multifactorial respiratory failure with OSA,
   CHF exacerbation related to fluid recuscitation for GI bleed.   Patient
   on admission requiring placement on ventilator for respiratory
   support.  CXR done on HD 1 AM with left-sided chest white-out, possibly
   collapse.  A CT chest was done for futher evaluation which was without
   e/o esophageal perforation, LLL atelectasis/collapse but with L lung
   expanded, a small plueral.  The patients AM CXR continued to improve
   daily as she was weaned off pressors, continued on
   albuterol/ipratropium and decreased on her overall fluid intake.  On HD
   3 she was weaned off vent to trach collar successfully without further
   ventilator support requirements.
   - daily CXR
   - cont trach collar, currently stable
   .
   # Bradycardia/NSTEMI.  Troponin bump to 0.13 with normal CK.  Likely
   demand in setting of large GI losses. Cardiac enzymes trended down
   during hospital course and there was no further conern for cardiac
   ischemia.  Echo performed on HD4 as discussed above.
   - Hold on ASA, plavix, heparin given magnitude of bleed.
   .
   # Chronic dHF- Last TTE shows grade I diastolic dysfxn and EF 50-55%.
   Due to hypotension requiring dopamine during hospital course, patient
   was held on her home lasix and lisinopril.  Echo done on [**4-5**] with
   markedly dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid
   regurgitation that is directed towards the inter-atrial septum. Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with pressure/volume overload of
   the left ventricle. Left ventricular function with EF>55%.  Due to
   hypotension and
   - hold lasix, lisinopril given concern for hypotension.
   - monitor fluid balance once losses stabilize.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation.
   - hold warfarin.
   - hold diltiazem
   .
   # UTI.  Continuous hospital exposures with risk for resistant
   organisms.  U/A on admission concerning for UTI.  She was started
   empirically on zosyn on admission given exposures.  Subsequent Ucx from
   ED on [**4-1**] with E.coli sensitive to zosyn, cipro, CTX, [**Last Name (un) 430**].  She was
   switched from zosyn to cipro on [**4-4**] after sensitivities back.  She
   will complete a full 7 day course.
   - cont cipro for 7d course for complicated UTI
   .
   # Diabetes-  Seems like this is diet controlled, no diabetes
   medications on past d/c summaries, [**11-30**] HgbA1c 6.1%.  Her blood
   glucose was well controlled on sliding scale insulin.
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # CKD- stage III - Baseline 1.2-1.5.  During admission, Cr from 1.1 on
   admission with rise to 1.5 and then trended down to baseline range.
   Patient started back on lasix on HD 4.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, chronic heart failure (dHF), and a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) due to diverticulosis. The patient presented with rectal bleeding and was admitted for bronchospasm, respiratory failure, hypotension, and suspected diverticular bleeding.

During her hospital course, the patient received blood products and fluids for the GI bleed. She was initially hypotensive but responded to IV fluids. However, she required dopamine support for blood pressure management. No active bleed was identified during angiography, but a colonoscopy showed old blood, multiple diverticuli, and no clear source of bleeding. The patient's Hct levels have remained stable since the bleed.

The patient also experienced hypotension, which was initially treated with IV fluids and dopamine. She was weaned off dopamine without complications. An echocardiogram revealed a markedly dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation. There was also severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with pressure/volume overload of the left ventricle. Left ventricular function was preserved with an ejection fraction >55%. These findings were attributed to overall fluid overload status due to pressors/fluid resuscitation/blood products given for the GI bleed.

The patient required respiratory support and was placed on a ventilator for respiratory failure. Initially"

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 149/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the tracheostomy mask. The arterial line was stopped, and the transthoracic echo was performed. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for no abdominal pain and no dyspnea. The flowsheet data shows that the patient has received various medications including pantoprazole, furosemide, ciprofloxacin, and simvastatin. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 400 mL and output of 2,405 mL. 

The lab results indicate a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 153 K/uL, platelet count of 75 mg/dL, sodium level of 1.1 mg/dL, potassium level of 28 mEq/L, and blood glucose level of 106 mg/dL. The results also show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, troponin-T, and lactic acid.
