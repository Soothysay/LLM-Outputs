   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year-old man with a history of severe CAD s/p CABG x 2
   and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shorness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to decompensated LV
   dysfunction in the setting of [**Holiday **] meal and increased sodium
   load.  Compliant with heart failure medications per family. Previous
   TTEs suggestive of a mainly diastolic LV dysfunction but there is a
   component of systolic dysfunction give inferolateral hypokinesis and EF
   decrease from 70 to 55 over the last year. Also baseline MR (2+) which
   may also be contributing to diastolic dysfunction. Unlikely that
   worsening of MR is responsible for this decompensation. Another PNA
   (bacterial vs aspiration). A new ischemic event or PE are not likely
   given this presentation. Apparently no fever, muscle aches or other URI
   symptoms, suggesting unlikely influenza.
   - ROMI
   - given recent epidemic will r/o influenza despite low risk factors
   - will check sputum cx and urine legionella
   - repeat TTE in am
   - continue on vent, wean sedation as tolerated, RSBI in am.
   - furosemide bolus +/- ggt as needed; net hourly output of 100-150
   cc/hr, or as tolerated
   - nitroglycerin and morphine as needed
   - continue empiric antibx for HCAP (MRSA colonizer); dc abc if
   Scx/Ulegionella negative or if his CXR improves with diuresis
   - add osletimavir if spikes
   - not on ACEi/[**Last Name (un) 239**] given hyperkalemia; will consider adding hydralazine
   to the current regimen for afterload reduction (hydral/nitrate instead
   of ACEi)
   - will consider milrinone if needed
   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  No history of recent CP or anginal equivalent per family.
   EKG without acute changes and first set enzymes negative.
   - ROMI
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, carvedilol, atorvastatin and isosorbide
   mononitrate.
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   - continue carvedilol and nifedipine
   #  Chronic kidney injury:  Creatinine currently near baseline of 1.3.
   Has had acute renal failure in setting of diuresis in past, including
   previous admission for CHF exacerbation.
   - trend creatinine
   - continue diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   #  MDS/ Chronic Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at
   baseline thought [**12-31**] myelodysplasia. Followed by Heme as outpatient. On
   Epo injections.

","The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2 and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), dilated congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to decompensated left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the setting of a holiday meal and increased sodium load.

Previous transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) suggestive of mainly diastolic LV dysfunction but there is a component of systolic dysfunction given inferolateral hypokinesis and ejection fraction (EF) decrease from 70 to 55 over the last year. Also baseline mitral regurgitation (MR) (2+) which may also be contributing to diastolic dysfunction. Unlikely that worsening of MR is responsible for this decompensation.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Extubated successfully; Feels better but reports upper back discomfort
   similar to prior angina
   Physical Examination
   Lungs mostly clear.
   No change in murmur.
   ECG shows LVH with pseudo anterior  infarct. Increase in lateral ST
   depression but at faster rate.
   Medical Decision Making
   Acute heart failure decompensation related ot possible ischemia or
   dietary indiscretion.  Continue diuresis, beta blocker for rate
   control.
   Will not plan for cardiac catheterization for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2 and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), dilated congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure, most likely caused by CHF. He was given IV Lasix and extubated successfully this morning without complications. Flu swab, Legionella, and sputum gram stain were negative, indicating that pneumonia is very unlikely. The patient's chest X-ray showed no infiltrate, and he is afebrile with no increased white blood cell count.

The patient's cardiac status is complicated by increased aortic stenosis and an ejection fraction of 45-50%. He also has a history of substernal chest pain and back pain, which are anginal equivalents. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no acute changes, and coronary angiography (ROMI) was negative x3.

The patient's hypertension is currently controlled with a home regimen including a beta-blocker (BB) and calcium channel blocker (CCB). He is currently on medical management with ASA, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin.

The patient has chronic kidney injury with creatinine"

   nitro drip and hydralazine.  Tachycardia remained refractory to
   escalating doses of lopressor.  At midnight his HR increased to 110 and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. He has had good urine output with IV Lasix and was successfully extubated without complications. The initial assessment suggests that the patient may have respiratory failure due to congestive heart failure (CHF), but further evaluation is needed.

The patient's medical history includes multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, decompensated CHF, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and myelodysplasia. His current medications include antiplatelet agents, statins, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and insulin.

The patient's current condition includes controlled hypertension, chronic kidney injury with creatinine near baseline, chronic normocytic anemia, and uncontrolled angina. His blood pressure is currently controlled with a combination of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. He is also receiving IV heparin, nitroglycerin, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, troponin T, glucose, and potassium, along with decreased levels of albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.31"

   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shorness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely CHF. Pt has had good UOP with IV
   Lasix. Extubated this AM with no complications. Flu swab negative. [**Last Name (un) **]
   legionella negative. Sputum gram stain negative. No infiltrate on CXR,
   afebrile, no incr WBC count, so PNA very unlikely. Possible chemical
   pneumonitis from aspiration during intubation in the field, but no
   indication for Abx at this time. ECHO with increased aortic stenosis,
   EF 45-50%.
   - ROMI: CE negative x3 at presentation

   the day. Speech/swallow c/s, NGT
   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   this AM. EKG without acute changes. CE negative x3.  Newly CE + in the
   setting of likely demand ischemia.
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - continue heparin until enzymes peak
   - d/c nitro gtt, transition back to home isosorbide (90mg q24hr)
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   -          Restarted Carvedilol
   -          Wean nitro drip and restart nifedipine now that pt is
   tolerating NPO
   #  Chronic kidney injury:  Creatinine currently near baseline of 1.3.
   Has had acute renal failure in setting of diuresis in past, including
   previous admission for CHF exacerbation.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Events over night reviewed with CCU team.  Probable angina last PM in
   association with mild  tachycardia. Feels better today.
   Physical Examination
   Looks well.
   + [**1-4**] AS and MR murmurs.
   JVP not elevated.
   Medical Decision Making
   Improving acute heart failure decompensation. Acute coronary syndrome
   with ischemia is possible etiology versus ongoing demand ischemia due
   to increased wall stress and tachycardia related more to volume
   overload.  Cardiac catheterization is not planned.  Will continue some
   diuresis, beta blockade with carvedilol in outpatient dosing, nitrates
   as isosorbide mononitrate, and calcium channel blocker nifedipine.
   Begin to increase activity.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure, but was extubated successfully without complications. His flu and Legionella swabs were negative, and sputum gram stain did not show any signs of pneumonia. There were no infiltrates on the chest X-ray, and the patient is currently sitting at 96% on room air.

The patient has a history of chronic normocytic anemia, which is thought to be caused by myelodysplasia. He is currently on erythropoietin injections. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with a combination of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. His diabetes type 2 is managed with insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents.

The patient experienced chest pain and back pain overnight, which is likely due to angina equivalent. An EKG did not show any acute changes, but the patient's cardiac enzymes were slightly elevated. Coronary catheterization is not planned at this time.

The patient's kidney function is near baseline, with a creatinine level of 1.3. Diuretics will continue to be administered, and medications will be dosed based on renal function.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure who was admitted to the ICU for acute decompensation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 mmHg to 123/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient has a partial flail of the posterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation, as seen on TEE. There are no obvious valvular vegetation, mass, or abscess seen. The patient continues to receive diuretics with IV lasix and insulin.

The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels. The ABG results show respiratory failure with a pH of 7.29. The rest of the lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals that peripheral pulses and skin are not assessed due to unknown reasons. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and there are"

   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shorness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Most likely CHF although possible chemical
   pneumonitis while down on field. Pt having poor response to IV lasix
   and bumex. ECHO with increased aortic stenosis, EF 45-50%.
   - ROMI: CE negative x3 at presentation
   - currently satting 96% on 2LNC
   - given recent epidemic will r/o influenza despite low risk factors
   - Lasix IV boluses prn
 pu out well yesterday
   - pt extubated, initially no gag reflex, however gag came back later in
   the day. Speech/swallow c/s, NGT
   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   this AM. EKG without acute changes. CE negative x3.  Newly CE + in the
   setting of likely demand ischemia.
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - continue heparin until enzymes peak
   - d/c nitro gtt, transition back to home isosorbide (90mg q24hr)
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   -          Restarted Carvedilol
   -          Wean nitro drip and restart nifedipine now that pt is
   tolerating NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of acute decompensated heart failure and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's current condition of acute decompensated heart failure may lead to further deterioration if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if adequate oxygenation and ventilation are not maintained.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has a history of severe coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgeries. There is a possibility of ongoing cardiac ischemia, which could potentially lead to myocardial infarction.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is compromised due to CKD, and aggressive diuresis may result in acute renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia due to his respiratory distress and impaired lung function.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of DVT formation.

   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Mr [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year-old man with a history of severe CAD s/p CABG x
   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shortness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Initial presentation most consistent with acute
   on chronic CHF with elevated JVP and peripheral edema with pulmonary
   edema on CXR.  Etiology of exacerbation unknown: no evidence of recent
   ischemic event on admission (CE negative x 3).  ECHO with increased
   aortic stenosis, EF 45-50%. Possible component of chemical pneumonitis
   while down on field but no signs of pulmonary infection: no
   leukocytosis/ fevers and sputum sample/ flu negative.  Patient
   initially improved with about -2.5L diuresis.  Now  s/p extubation with
   increased respiratory distress, sating only 94% on 5-6LNC.  ABG with
   respiratory acidosis.  CXR shows right middle lobe intervascular
   congestion vs consolidation.  Differential for acute decompensation:
   pulmonary edema vs aspiration PNA
   - f/u final read stat CXR to dx PNA vs worsening heart failure
   - BiPAP for respiratory distress, wean to NC as tolerated
   - restart abx for HAP and asp pneumonia: vancomycin/ cefepime/
   clindamycin
   - start nitro gtt for presumed
   - strict I/O with goal fluid balance equal

   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   yesterday. Newly CE + in the setting of renal insufficiency, suggestive
   of ischemic event.
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - start on nitro gtt
   - repeat EKG
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   -          decrease dose carvedilol, d/c nifedepine and Isosorbid
   -          start on nitro gtt in setting presumed pulmonary edema
   #  Acute on Chronic kidney injury:  Increased creatinine with
   aggressive diuresis: creatinine 2.2 from baseline of 1.3.  Likely
   indicative of  intravascular depletion.  Has had acute renal failure in
   setting of diuresis in past, including previous admission for CHF
   exacerbation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to acute on chronic CHF. The patient initially improved with diuresis but now has increased respiratory distress after extubation. ABG results show respiratory acidosis, and a chest X-ray reveals right middle lobe interstitial congestion versus consolidation. Differential diagnoses include pulmonary edema versus aspiration pneumonia.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include:

1. CAD s/p CABG x2 and multiple stents: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgeries and multiple stents. He complains of substernal chest pain and back pain (anginal equivalent), and there is a concern for an ischemic event.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin.
   - Start nitroglycerin (NTG) in the setting of presumed pulmonary edema.
   - Repeat EKG.

2. HTN: The patient's hypertension is currently controlled with a home regimen including beta-blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers (CCB).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient has severe diastolic heart failure with elevated JVP and peripheral edema, along with pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray. This exacerbation is likely due to acute on chronic CHF. The cause of the exacerbation is unknown, and there is no evidence of a recent ischemic event.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, most likely secondary to acute on chronic CHF. There are no signs of pulmonary infection.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) s/p CABG x2 and multiple PCIs: The patient has a history of severe CAD and has undergone CABG surgeries and multiple stent placements. He is currently on medical management for CAD. He complains of substernal chest pain and back pain, which may indicate angina equivalents. EKG findings do not show any acute changes.
4. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's hypertension is currently controlled with a combination of beta-blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, acute respiratory failure, and other comorbidities. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's condition has been stable with appropriate medical interventions, including diuretics, insulin, and respiratory support. However, there are concerns regarding his fluid balance and urine output, which may require further adjustments in his medication regimen. The patient's vital signs are generally within normal limits, except for low blood pressure. Laboratory results show some abnormalities, such as elevated BUN and creatinine levels, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction. There are also indications of electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia and hypomagnesemia. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, indicating no evidence of acute myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may exacerbate, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction. If not addressed, AKI can progress and lead to renal failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as he is on supplemental oxygen and may require mechanical ventilation if his condition deteriorates.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The presence of hyperkalemia and hypomagnesemia needs to be corrected to avoid potential cardiac arr"

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 mmHg to 123/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been receiving Bumex 2 mg/d, which is his home dose, and has been uptitrated from 1 to 2 mg/d. The patient did not produce enough urine in response to Bumex, so IV lasix boluses were given with limited UOP response. The patient's laboratory values show elevated creatinine levels at 2.2 mg/dL and potassium levels at 5.7 K/uL. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, but there are slight variations in other lab results such as hematocrit, platelet count, troponin-T, glucose, and liver enzymes. The patient's chest X-ray showed no acute changes. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2 and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 mmHg to 81/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, use of accessory muscles, diffuse expiratory wheeze with bibasilar rales, and distended abdomen. His mental status is described as pleasant and responsive.

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. His current lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to decompensated chronic heart failure. He is being treated with intravenous diuretics (Lasix and Bumex) but is not responding well. An echocardiogram shows increased aortic stenosis and an ejection fraction of 45-50%. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG and multiple stents, and he presents with chest pain and back pain, suggestive of demand ischemia. His chest X-ray is negative for pneumonia.

The patient's acute kidney injury is noted, with increased creatinine levels from 1.3 to 2.2. His chronic normocytic anemia is also documented, and he is on erythropoietin injections. His diabetes type 2 is managed with insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the coronary critical care unit (CCU)."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Worsening dyspnea over night and this morning.
   Physical Examination
   Currentlyv on BiPap and appears comfortable.
   Diffuse crackles.
   No change in murmurs.
   CXR: Pulmonary edema
   ECG: LVH without acute ischemic changes
   Medical Decision Making
   Acute decompensation of heart failure.  Ischemia is most likely
   etiology with worsening MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) **] continue BiPap, IV nitrates, and attempt gentle diuresis but goal
   <500 cc negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and heart failure (HF). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to pulmonary edema secondary to acute decompensation of chronic HF. Other potential causes include aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis. The patient's cardiac history includes substernal chest pain and back pain, suggesting possible ischemic heart disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic HF with pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
2. Ischemic heart disease leading to myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
3. Aspiration pneumonia due to impaired swallowing reflex.
4. Chemical pneumonitis caused by inhalation of toxic substances or aspiration of gastric contents.
5. Acute kidney injury secondary to aggressive diuresis or intravascular depletion.
6. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
9. Malnutrition or inadequate nutritional support.
10. Stress-related ulcer bleeding due to the use of corticosteroids or"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Worsening dyspnea over night and this morning.
   Physical Examination
   Currentlyv on BiPap and appears comfortable.
   Diffuse crackles.
   No change in murmurs.
   CXR: Pulmonary edema
   ECG: LVH without acute ischemic changes
   Medical Decision Making
   Acute decompensation of heart failure.  Ischemia is most likely
   etiology with worsening MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) **] continue BiPap, IV nitrates, and attempt gentle diuresis but goal
   <500 cc negative.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4533**], MD
   on:[**2171-10-28**] 18:54 ------
   Reexamination now. Off BiPap, conversing without dyspnea.  Discussed
   option of cardiac cath and possible PCI if amenable lesion. He and
   daughter prefer medical therapy with cath as option if not improving.
   Total critical care time today: 45 minutes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery twice, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), diastolic heart failure (DHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and peripheral edema. There is also evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory distress has worsened after extubation, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis. The differential for acute decompensation includes pulmonary edema versus aspiration pneumonia (PNA). Further imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of severe CAD and has presented with substernal chest pain and back pain, which may indicate an ischemic event. This is further supported by a positive cardiac enzyme (CE) test in the setting of renal insufficiency. The patient is currently on medical management for CAD, including antiplatelet therapy (ASA and clopidogrel) and statin therapy (atorvastatin). Nitroglycerin"

   24 Hour Events:
   - started Bumex 2 mg/d.  After discussion with family, it turns out
   that was actually the patient's home dose; it was uptitrated from 1 to
   2 mg/d by his rehab center a while ago.
   - did not put out enough urine to Bumex, gave IV lasix boluses with
   limited UOP response, may want to consider uptitrating Bumex tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and myelodysplasia. He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. 

The patient has acute respiratory failure on the background of chronic heart failure, as evidenced by elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The cause of this exacerbation is unknown. An echocardiogram shows increased aortic stenosis and an ejection fraction of 45-50%. There are no signs of pulmonary infection, and no evidence of recent ischemic events on admission. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG and multiple stents, currently managed medically. He complains of substernal chest pain and back pain (anginal equivalent) yesterday. His electrocardiogram (EKG) does not show acute changes, but he is newly positive for cardiac enzymes in the setting of renal insufficiency. 

The patient also has acute on chronic kidney injury, with an increased creatinine level from baseline of 1.3 to 2.2 after aggressive diuresis. He has had acute renal failure in the past during diuresis, including a previous admission for heart failure exacerbation. 

Additionally, the patient has chronic normocytic anemia,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient likely has acute exacerbation of chronic CHF with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and peripheral edema, along with pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The cause of exacerbation is unknown, and there is no evidence of recent ischemic events.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, most likely due to acute exacerbation of CHF. There is no evidence of pulmonary infection.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of severe CAD with previous CABG surgeries and multiple stents. He complains of substernal chest pain and back pain, which may indicate angina equivalents.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently controlled with a combination of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
5. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient has increased creatinine levels with aggressive diuretics"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and has been admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of his condition. The patient's medical allergies include indomethacin, ace inhibitors, and certain anti-inflammatory/anti-arthritic agents. The patient's current medications include bumex, furosemide (lasix), and insulin.

Upon reviewing the patient's progress note, it is mentioned that the patient's home dose of bumex was increased from 1 to 2 mg/day by his rehab center. However, the patient did not produce enough urine with this dose, leading to the administration of IV lasix boluses. The response to the lasix was limited, and the healthcare team is considering uptitrating the bumex or switching to metolazone.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 mmHg to 81/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,309 mL and output of 900 mL, resulting in a balance of 409 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, regular heart rhythm with normal rate"

   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shortness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Exacerbation of respiratory distress yesterday:
   pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia vs new PNA improved with
   conservative management.  Saturating 97% on 4LNC.  S/p diuresis of 3.7
   L since admission, now appears euvolemic to hypovolemic.   Remains
   afebrile with no leukocytosis, productive cough.
   - CXR this am to further delineate PNA vs pulmonary edema
   - cont vanco/cefepime/clinda for empiric ABX HAP
   - repeat sputum culture
   - wean off nitro gtt, start nitro paste; consider ranolazine if cont
   ischemia
   - strict I/O with goal fluid balance equal, add home meds Bumex 2mg as
   needed
   .
   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   2 days ago. Newly CE + in the setting of renal insufficiency,
   suggestive of ischemic event.  In conversation with family, would like
   to maximize medical therapy instead of intravascular intervention
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - titrate down nitro gtt, add nitropaste
   - repeat EKG in am
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   - cont decreased dose carvedilol
   - start low dose amlodipine in place of nifedipine
   #  Acute on Chronic kidney injury:  creatinine returning to baseline,
   today 1.5 from peak of 2.2 with aggressive diuresis.  Likely indicative
   of  intravascular depletion.  Has had acute renal failure in setting of
   diuresis in past, including previous admission for CHF exacerbation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - strict I/O with goal fluid balance 0 cc/24hrs
   #  MDS/ Chronic Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at
   baseline thought [**12-31**] myelodysplasia. Followed by Heme as outpatient. On
   Epo injections.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of increasing respiratory distress requiring BiPAP in the morning, which was successfully weaned off in the afternoon. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure (CHF) and presents with acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure and acute respiratory failure not consistent with ARDS. 

Key events in the past 24 hours include increasing respiratory distress, use of BiPAP, administration of diuretics (Bumex held, Chlorothiazide 500mg IV x1, and Lasix 120mg IV bolus), a chest X-ray showing pulmonary edema versus pneumonia, restart of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, reduction in rate of carvedilol and discontinuation of isosorbide/nifedipine, initiation of nitroglycerin gtt, and restart of home Lantus insulin at 10 units (normally takes 14 units at home).

The patient has allergies to indomethacin, ace inhibitors, and anti-inflamm/anti-arth agents. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin at 10:30 AM, ciprofloxacin at 12:00 PM, and cefepime at 02:00 PM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of nitroglycerin at 0.24 mcg/kg/min and furosemide (Lasix) given at 08"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Mr [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year-old man with a history of severe CAD s/p CABG x
   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shortness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Initial presentation most consistent with acute
   on chronic CHF with elevated JVP and peripheral edema with pulmonary
   edema on CXR.  Etiology of exacerbation unknown: no evidence of recent
   ischemic event on admission (CE negative x 3).  ECHO with increased
   aortic stenosis, EF 45-50%. Possible component of chemical pneumonitis
   while down on field but no signs of pulmonary infection: no
   leukocytosis/ fevers and sputum sample/ flu negative.  Patient
   initially improved with about -2.5L diuresis.  Now  s/p extubation with
   increased respiratory distress, sating only 94% on 5-6LNC.  ABG with
   respiratory acidosis.  CXR shows right middle lobe intervascular
   congestion vs consolidation.  Differential for acute decompensation:
   pulmonary edema vs aspiration PNA
   - f/u final read stat CXR to dx PNA vs worsening heart failure
   - BiPAP for respiratory distress, wean to NC as tolerated
   - restart abx for HAP and asp pneumonia: vancomycin/ cefepime/
   clindamycin
   - start nitro gtt for presumed
   - strict I/O with goal fluid balance equal
   .
   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   yesterday. Newly CE + in the setting of renal insufficiency, suggestive
   of ischemic event.
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - start on nitro gtt
   - repeat EKG
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   -          decrease dose carvedilol, d/c nifedepine and Isosorbid
   -          start on nitro gtt in setting presumed pulmonary edema
   #  Acute on Chronic kidney injury:  Increased creatinine with
   aggressive diuresis: creatinine 2.2 from baseline of 1.3.  Likely
   indicative of  intravascular depletion.  Has had acute renal failure in
   setting of diuresis in past, including previous admission for CHF
   exacerbation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - strict I/O with goal fluid balance 0 cc/24hrs
   #  MDS/ Chronic Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at
   baseline thought [**12-31**] myelodysplasia. Followed by Heme as outpatient. On
   Epo injections.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) that has been treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). He also has a history of diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The patient presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. Initial presentation suggests acute on chronic CHF with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and peripheral edema, as well as pulmonary edema on chest X-ray (CXR).
- There is no evidence of recent ischemic events on admission, and the cause of exacerbation is unknown.
- The patient initially improved with diuresis but then experienced increased respiratory distress after extubation. He is now oxygenating at 94% on 5-6 liters nasal cannula (NC), and arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis. CXR shows right middle lobe intervascular congestion versus consolidation, raising suspicion of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) versus worsening heart failure.
- The patient was placed on BiPAP for respiratory distress and weaned to NC as tolerated. Antibiotics were restarted for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia: vancomycin, cefepime, and clind"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, chronic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: The patient has a history of severe CAD, CABG surgeries, and chronic CHF. He presents with symptoms consistent with acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation.
2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE: The patient has experienced an exacerbation of respiratory distress yesterday, with pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia versus new pneumonia. Conservative management has improved the condition.
3. CAD s/p CABG x2 and multiple PCIs: The patient has a history of significant CAD, including CABG surgeries and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). He presents with substernal chest pain (anginal equivalent) and back pain, suggesting an ischemic event.
4. HTN: The patient's hypertension is currently controlled. His home regimen includes a beta-blocker (BB) and a calcium channel blocker (CCB). However, the dose of carvedilol needs to be decreased, and nifedipine and isosorbide should be discontinued.
5. Acute on Chronic kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels have increased with aggressive diuresis, indicating intravascular depletion. He has had acute renal failure in the past during diuretic use.
6. MDS/ Chronic Normocytic Anemia: The patient has known chronic anemia due to myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS). He is being followed by hematology as an outpatient and receives Epo injections.
7. Diabetes type 2: The patient's hyperglycemia has improved with the restart of Lantus at a dose of 10 units, which is lower than his usual home dose of 14 units.
8. Other issues include prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's nutrition is managed through a regular diet, and glycemic control is monitored with finger sticks every 6 hours.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, exacerbation of respiratory distress or failure, further deterioration of renal function, progression of anemia, and uncontrolled diabetes."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), diastolic heart failure (DHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

Assessment and plan:
1. Heart failure (HF), diastolic, acute on chronic: The patient has a history of severe CAD, previous CABG surgeries, and DHF. He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. His respiratory failure is likely due to exacerbation of respiratory distress yesterday, with pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia vs new pneumonia (PNA). Conservative management has improved his condition, and he is now euvolemic to hypovolemic. A chest X-ray will be done to further delineate PNA vs pulmonary edema. Empiric antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) will continue, and the nitroglycerin patch will be started. Fluid balance will be strictly monitored with a goal of equal input and output.

2. Coronary artery disease (CAD) s/p CABG x2 and multiple stents: The patient is on medical management for CAD. He experiences substernal chest pain (CP) and back pain (anginal equivalent) yesterday, indicating a possible ischemic event. His current"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Mr [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year-old man with a history of severe CAD s/p CABG x
   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shortness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Exacerbation of respiratory distress yesterday:
   pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia vs new PNA improved with
   conservative management.  Saturating 97% on 4LNC.  S/p diuresis of 3.7
   L since admission, now appears euvolemic to hypovolemic.   Remains
   afebrile with no leukocytosis, productive cough.
   - CXR this am to further delineate PNA vs pulmonary edema
   - cont vanco/cefepime/clinda for empiric ABX HAP
   - repeat sputum culture
   - wean off nitro gtt, start nitro paste; consider ranolazine if cont
   ischemia
   - strict I/O with goal fluid balance equal, add home meds Bumex 2mg as
   needed
   .
   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   2 days ago. Newly CE + in the setting of renal insufficiency,
   suggestive of ischemic event.  In conversation with family, would like
   to maximize medical therapy instead of intravascular intervention
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - titrate down nitro gtt, add nitropaste
   - repeat EKG in am
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   - cont decreased dose carvedilol
   - start low dose amlodipine in place of nifedipine
   #  Acute on Chronic kidney injury:  creatinine returning to baseline,
   today 1.5 from peak of 2.2 with aggressive diuresis.  Likely indicative
   of  intravascular depletion.  Has had acute renal failure in setting of
   diuresis in past, including previous admission for CHF exacerbation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - strict I/O with goal fluid balance 0 cc/24hrs
   #  MDS/ Chronic Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at
   baseline thought [**12-31**] myelodysplasia. Followed by Heme as outpatient. On
   Epo injections.
   - trend hct
   # Diabetes type 2: hyperglycemia improved with lantus dose
   - finger sticks qachs
   - continue lantus and ISS

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Comfortable without angina or worsening dyspnea over night
   Physical Examination
   Lung fields essentially clear. No change in murmurs.
   Medical Decision Making
   Acute event yesterday consistent with ischemia probably with associated
   acute mitral insufficiency. He has had excellent response to acute
   medical therapy, but long term success of concern.  Will attempt to
   taper IV nitro and transition to topical nitrate and add amlodipine 5
   mg daily. Will also consider addition of ranolazine, but suspect may
   require cardiac cath and possible revascularization if amenable lesion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory failure is exacerbated by pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia versus new pneumonia. He has been managed conservatively and appears euvolemic to hypovolemic. The patient's cardiac history includes substernal chest pain and back pain (anginal equivalent) for two days, indicating possible ischemic events. He prefers medical management over invasive intervention. The patient's hypertension is currently controlled with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. His acute kidney injury is likely due to intravascular depletion. The patient has a known chronic normocytic anemia and requires epo injections. His diabetes mellitus type 2 is improving with insulin glargine (Lantus) dose adjustments. The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, carvedilol, nitroglycerin, furosemide (Lasix), bumex, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime, ranitidine, heparin, docusate, senna, and bisacodyl.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The initial presentation is consistent with acute on chronic heart failure with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and peripheral edema, as well as pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. There is no evidence of recent ischemic event on admission. The patient initially improved with diuresis but then experienced increased respiratory distress after extubation. The ABG shows respiratory acidosis, and the CXR shows right middle lobe intervascular congestion versus consolidation. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema versus aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been managed with BiPAP for respiratory distress, restart of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia, and initiation of nitroglycerin for presumed pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema or aspiration pneumonia.
3. Possible chemical pneumonitis while on mechanical ventilation.
4. Acute kidney injury due to aggressive diuresis and intravascular depletion.
5. Chronic normocytic anemia with known myelodysplasia.
6. Hyperglycemia secondary to diabetes"

   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shortness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Exacerbation of respiratory distress yesterday:
   pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia vs new PNA improved with
   conservative management.  Saturating 97% on 4LNC.  S/p diuresis of 3.7
   L since admission, now appears euvolemic to hypovolemic.   Remains
   afebrile with no leukocytosis, productive cough. CXR concerning for
   PNA.
   - cont vanco/cefepime/clinda for empiric ABX HAP, day 3 of 7
   - repeat sputum culture
   - wean off nitro gtt, start nitro paste; consider ranolazine if cont
   ischemia
   - strict I/O with goal fluid balance equal, add home meds Bumex 2mg as
   needed

   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   2 days ago. Newly CE + in the setting of renal insufficiency,
   suggestive of ischemic event.  In conversation with family, would like
   to maximize medical therapy instead of intravascular intervention
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - titrate down nitro gtt, add nitropaste
   - repeat EKG in am
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.

- Patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), decompensated heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The patient presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.
- He was diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, likely secondary to ischemia or a new pneumonia. Conservative management improved his condition.
- The patient has been receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and clindamycin for empirical antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- His fluid balance has been closely monitored, and he has undergone diuresis. He appears euvolemic to hypovolemic.
- The patient's cardiac status has been evaluated, considering his history of CAD, CABGx2, and multiple stents. He experienced substernal chest pain and back pain, which may indicate an ischemic event. The family prefers to optimize medical therapy rather than pursue invasive intervention.
- The patient's hypertension is currently well-controlled with a beta-blocker (BB) and calcium channel blocker (CCB). His medication regimen includes ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, carvedilol, and amlodipine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 92-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. He has undergone two coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, exacerbated by pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia versus new pneumonia. He is currently receiving conservative management with diuretics and has shown improvement. The patient remains afebrile and does not have leukocytosis or a productive cough.

Regarding his CAD, the patient has substernal chest pain and back pain, which are anginal equivalents. His renal function is returning to baseline, indicating intravascular depletion. The patient also has chronic normocytic anemia, likely due to myelodysplasia, and is receiving epoetin injections. His diabetes type 2 is under control with insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema may lead to further deterioration of respiratory function and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute on chronic kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not closely monitored and managed appropriately.
3. Cardiovascular events: Given the patient's history"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   No further symptoms of ischemia x 24 hours. Will plan to increase
   amlodipine to 10 mg daily and attempt to wean IV nitro. If any further
   symptoms woudl consider adding ranolazine. If significant recurrence or
   hemodynamic compromise would probably then agree to cath. Have
   discussed this plan again with Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] and his son.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to an exacerbation of respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia versus new pneumonia. His condition has improved with conservative management. He is currently euvolemic to hypovolemic and remains afebrile with no leukocytosis or productive cough. The CXR shows concerns for pneumonia.

The patient's cardiac history includes CAD with previous CABG surgeries and multiple stents. He experiences substernal chest pain (CP) and back pain, which are anginal equivalents. Considering his renal insufficiency, these symptoms suggest an ischemic event. The patient prefers medical management over intravascular intervention.

His hypertension is currently controlled with a home regimen of beta-blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers (CCB). The patient will continue with his current dose of carvedilol and increase amlodipine to 10mg PO daily.

The patient has acute-on-chronic kidney injury, as indicated by a returning creatinine level to baseline. This is likely due to intravascular depletion. He has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2 and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

The patient has several medical conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Acute on chronic heart failure (CHF): The patient's current presentation with shortness of breath and respiratory distress is consistent with exacerbation of CHF. He has a history of severe CAD and previous admissions for CHF exacerbation. Diuretic therapy has been initiated to manage fluid overload.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress yesterday due to pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia or possible pneumonia (PNA). Conservative management was successful, and he is now stable on supplemental oxygen.

3. Chronic diastolic CHF: The patient initially presented with flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation from a CHF exacerbation. He had another episode of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema and PNA, likely caused by small ischemic events from severe CAD. Diuretic therapy has been withheld temporarily to prevent further fluid loss.

4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently well-controlled with a beta-blocker (carvedilol) and calcium channel"

   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shortness of
   breath and respiratory distress
   # Respiratory failure:  Exacerbation of respiratory distress yesterday:
   pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia vs new PNA improved with
   conservative management.  Saturating 97% on 4LNC.  S/p diuresis of 3.5
   L since admission, now appears euvolemic to hypovolemic.   Remains
   afebrile with no leukocytosis, productive cough. CXR concerning for
   PNA.
   - cont vanco/cefepime/clinda for empiric ABX HAP, day 1 = [**10-28**], day 3

   # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   mangagement:  Pt with substernal CP and back pain (anginal equivalent)
   2 days ago. Newly CE + in the setting of renal insufficiency,
   suggestive of ischemic event.  In conversation with family, would like
   to maximize medical therapy instead of intravascular intervention
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - titrate down nitro gtt, continue nitropaste
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   - cont home dose carvedilol
   - incr amlodipine to 10mg PO daily
   #  Acute on Chronic kidney injury:  creatinine returning to baseline,
   today 1.6 from peak of 2.2 with aggressive diuresis.  Likely indicative
   of  intravascular depletion.  Has had acute renal failure in setting of
   diuresis in past, including previous admission for CHF exacerbation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient's diastolic heart failure is exacerbated by acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia or possibly a new pneumonia (PNA). Conservative management has been attempted, and the patient appears euvolemic to hypovolemic.
   - Continue vancomycin, cefepime, and clindamycin for empiric antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
   - Repeat sputum culture.
   - Wean off nitroglycerin (NTG) gtt, but continue nitro paste.
   - Achieve strict intake/output balance with a goal of equal fluid balance, and add home meds Bumex 2mg as needed.

2. CAD s/p CABG x2 and multiple stents: The patient has substernal chest pain and back pain, which may indicate an ischemic event, especially considering his renal insufficiency.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) on a background of chronic heart failure (CHF). The patient has been receiving IV Lasix and metolazone, which suggests the presence of fluid overload. The use of diuretics indicates an attempt to manage pulmonary congestion and edema.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (83 bpm) with normal blood pressure (134/48 mmHg). The respiratory rate is slightly increased (23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is within normal range (97%). The patient's temperature is slightly below the normal range (36.1 C).

The physical examination reveals no respiratory distress, but the patient is using accessory muscles of respiration. There are bibasilar rales heard on lung auscultation, indicating pulmonary edema. The abdomen is described as distended but non-tender, suggesting possible ascites. The patient also has ankle edema, which is consistent with CHF.

Laboratory results show elevated BUN (209 K/uL) and creatinine (2.2 mg/dL), indicating possible renal dysfunction. The serum sodium level is slightly low (130 mg/dL), while potassium is within normal range (4.1 mEq/L). Glucose levels are elevated (255 mg/dL), which may be due to stress or poor glycemic control.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11005**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   PLeasant [**Age over 90 382**] year old male with h/o CAD, s/p two different CABG
   operations and multiple caths with stents to the SVG to PLBr who now
   presents with pulmonary edema and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation with mechanical ventilation. Pt had another episode of SOB
   yesterday considered flash pulmonary edema requiring BiPAP. Patient and
   his son and daughter now agree to re-look angiography with
   revcascularization of the SVG to PLBr (or LIMA to LAD) if indicated.
   Will proceed with cath.
   Physical Examination
   Lungs with decrease breath sounds bilaterally and rales to half up
   bilat
   Heart with soft SEM
   Ext with mild bipedal edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Cardiac cath today to define coronary anatomy and perc
   revascularization as indicated.
   Continue antianginal therapy with amlodipine 10g QD, coreg 50mg [**Hospital1 **],
   Plavix and asa.
   Continue antibiotics for presumed pneumonia.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath, respiratory distress, and chest pain.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely caused by ischemic events from severe CAD. He also has a history of chronic diastolic CHF, which initially presented with flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema and pneumonia.

His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 134/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar rales, rhonchi in the right lung more than the left, mild ankle edema, regular rhythm with normal rate, and no overt congestive heart failure (CHF).

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, elevated troponin T levels, increased lactic acid levels, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Imaging studies show a small right and moderate left pleural effusion, along with an increased opacity"

The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR).

The patient's weight is currently 61 kg, and his height is 62 inches. His total fluid input since 12 AM is 1,303 mL, with 750 mL given via PO, 553 mL via IVF, and 2 mL via other sources. His total fluid output since 12 AM is 595 mL via urine and 440 mL via blood products. The patient's NG output is not assessed, stool output is not assessed, drain output is not assessed, and his balance is 708 mL with a negative 438 mL difference.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device of a nasal cannula, and his SpO2 is 97%. His ABG results show the following values: pH of ///28/. 

The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals that the right radial pulse, left radial pulse, right DP pulse, and left DP pulse are all not assessed. The skin examination is also not assessed. The neurologic examination shows that the patient responds to stimuli but movement"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 134/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is using accessory muscles of respiration and has bibasilar rales on lung auscultation. There is no evidence of jugular venous distention, but there is ankle edema present.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating kidney dysfunction. There are also elevated levels of potassium, glucose, and troponin T. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated. The platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values, such as liver enzymes and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's use of accessory muscles of respiration and presence of bibasilar rales suggest worsening respiratory function. Immediate attention should be given to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and the presence of ankle edema suggest diastolic dysfunction. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. He has undergone two coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The patient also has chronic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a chronic normocytic anemia thought to be due to myelodysplasia.

The patient's current condition includes acute decompensated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome), hypertension, acute-on-chronic kidney injury, and chronic normocytic anemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of heart failure symptoms, further respiratory distress, recurrent ischemic events, worsening kidney function, uncontrolled hypertension, and exacerbation of diabetes mellitus.

The patient's treatment plan includes maximizing medical therapy for ischemic heart disease, strict input/output balance to prevent fluid overload, continued management of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and monitoring of kidney function and anemia."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone two coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). He also has a history of diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic normocytic anemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: The patient presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress due to flash pulmonary edema caused by an acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic CHF. The patient's ejection fraction is not mentioned, but it is likely reduced given his history of severe CAD and previous CABG surgeries.

2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS): The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress from pulmonary edema and pneumonia (PNA). This suggests significant hypoxemia and respiratory compromise.

3. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury. This could be due to intravascular depletion from aggressive diuresis or other factors such as contrast-induced nephropathy from cardiac catheterization.

4. HYPERTENSION: The patient's hypertension is currently controlled with a"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema, which required intubation. He also has an acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic CHF. There is a concern for recurrent edema if not revascularized. The patient's chronic kidney injury is likely indicative of intravascular depletion, and aggressive diuresis has helped in returning his creatinine levels to baseline.

The patient is currently on medical management for his severe CAD, including antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, statin therapy with atorvastatin, and nitropaste for angina relief. The plan is to continue these medications and possibly perform a cardiac catheterization today to assess the need for further revascularization.

The patient's other medical conditions include hypertension (HTN), which is currently controlled with a beta-blocker (carvedilol) and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). He is also being treated for a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with antibiotics covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone two coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). He also has a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic normocytic anemia possibly due to myelodysplasia.

The patient presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress, which is suggestive of an acute exacerbation of his chronic diastolic CHF. The patient's condition has been complicated by flash pulmonary edema, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypertension, acute on chronic kidney injury, and chronic normocytic anemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/40 mmHg to 109/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His current medications include aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, nitropaste, carvedilol, amlodipine, and insulin.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 169 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, blood glucose level of 107 mg/dL, creatinine level of"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient remains intubated and will check RSBI as well as try to
   extubate later today once sedation wears off. Cath yesterday
   demonstrated patent SCG to LPL and LIMA to LAD. Will continue to gently
   diurese to neg 1 Liter today as well as advance anti-ischemic regimen
   by substituting Imdur for NT paste. Will transfuse 1 unit in half
   packs.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The patient has been hospitalized multiple times for acute exacerbations of chronic heart failure (CHF) and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

The patient's current hospital course has been complicated by several episodes of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure, requiring intubation. He has received aggressive diuretic therapy and has shown improvement in his fluid status. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed no lesions amenable to intervention. 

The patient's medical management includes medications for CAD (ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin), CHF (imdur, carvedilol, amlodipine), and DM (lantus, ISS). Additionally, the patient has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (RBCs) to minimize symptoms of ischemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated and requires further evaluation of respiratory system integrity before considering extubation.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic CHF, and there is a risk"

He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. 

The patient has been experiencing several episodes of pulmonary edema and requires intubation due to respiratory failure. The medical team suspects a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) although the patient remains afebrile with no leukocytosis. 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed no lesions amenable to intervention. He is currently on medical management and is tolerating the procedure well with no acute complications. 

The patient also has chronic diastolic heart failure, initially presenting with flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. He has had repeat episodes of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema and possibly pneumonia. 

The patient's hypertension is currently controlled with a beta-blocker (BB) and calcium channel blocker (CCB). 

The patient has acute-on-chronic kidney injury, with a peak creatinine level of 2.2 that is returning to baseline after aggressive diuresis. 

The patient has known chronic normocytic anemia, which is being managed with erythropoietin (EPO) injections.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress. The patient has been hospitalized multiple times for pulmonary edema and chronic heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's current condition includes acute coronary syndrome (ACS), diabetes mellitus type II, diastolic heart failure, acute respiratory failure, and chronic kidney disease. The patient has also been diagnosed with myelodysplasia and chronic normocytic anemia. 

The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization with no lesions amenable to intervention. The patient's cardiac medications include aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker (CCB), and imdur (titrated up as tolerated by blood pressure). 

The patient's respiratory distress and repeated episodes of pulmonary edema have necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has received diuretics, including Lasix, to manage fluid overload and pulmonary edema. 

The patient's kidney function has fluctuated throughout the hospital course, with a peak creatinine level of 2.2. The patient has been aggressively diuresed, leading to intravascular depletion and acute renal failure. 

The patient's chronic normocytic anemia has been managed with erythropoietin (EPO) injections and blood transfusions as needed to maintain a hem"

- He also has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with chronic normocytic anemia.
- The patient presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress, which led to his admission to the ICU. He experienced several episodes of pulmonary edema during his hospital course.
- He required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to repeat pulmonary edema. The cause of the pulmonary edema is likely related to his unstable angina and coronary ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presents with shortness of breath and respiratory distress, leading to intubation due to pulmonary edema. He has experienced several episodes of pulmonary edema during his hospital course. The patient's respiratory failure is likely contributed by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), although he remains afebrile with no leukocytosis. He has been diuresed with approximately 1.5 liters following pulmonary edema. On minimal ventilatory settings, he can likely be extubated today.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - The patient's history of severe CAD, previous CABG surgeries, and symptoms of shortness of breath and respiratory distress may indicate ongoing ischemia or new myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient's current respiratory failure requires close monitoring and appropriate management, including weaning off ventilatory support and extubation if stable.
3. Pulmonary edema - Recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema may occur due to underlying heart failure or ischemic events from severe CAD.
4. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) - The patient's respiratory failure could be"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
- The patient presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress, which led to episodes of pulmonary edema.
- The patient required intubation twice during the hospital course due to respiratory failure secondary to repeat pulmonary edema.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has been receiving appropriate antibiotics.
- The patient's cardiac condition includes severe CAD with previous CABG surgeries and multiple stents. He is currently on medical management.
- The patient has chronic diastolic CHF with repeat episodes of respiratory distress from pulmonary edema and PNA. He appears mildly hypervolemic with bilateral pedal edema and jugular venous pressure (JVP).
- The patient's blood pressure is controlled with a combination of beta-blocker (carvedilol) and calcium channel blocker (amlodipine).
- The patient has experienced acute kidney injury, with creatinine levels returning to baseline after aggressive diuresis. This may indicate intravascular depletion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year-old man with a history of severe CAD s/p CABG x
   2 and multiple PCIs, dCHF, DM, and CKD who presents with shortness of
   breath and respiratory distress.  Hospital course complicated by
   several episodes of pulmonary edema
   # Respiratory failure: pt with respiratory failure requiring intubation
   twice during hospital course secondary to repeat pulmonary edema.
   Likely contribution from HAP although pt remains afebrile with no
   leukocytosis.  s/p diuresis of approx -5.4L during hospital stay
   - continue nebulizers
   - cont rx with clinda/cefepime/ vanco for 7 day course; day [**5-5**]: could
   likely narrow to vanco based on sputum cx
   - restart home diuretics Bumex 1mg [**Hospital1 **] with goal fluid balance -500 to
   -1000cc/hr
    # CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple stents, currently on medical
   management:  cardiac catheterization with no lesions amenable to
   intervention.  Likely experiencing microvascular ischemia leading to
   repeat episodes of pulmonary edema.  [**Hospital 1954**] medical therapy
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - titrate imdur dose to 120mg as tolerated by BP
   - continue B-blocker, CCB with goal HR in 50-60s
   - s/p transfusion with 1UpRBC to minimize symptoms of ischema
   # chronic diastolic CHF: initially presented with flash pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation from CHF exacerbation.  Hospital course cx by
   repeat episodes of resp distress from pulm edema and PNA .  Likely
   caused by small ischemic events from severe CAD.  Currently appears
   mildly hypervolemic with b/l pedal edema and JVP
   - strict I/O, net goal of -1.5L
   - Bum 1mg [**Hospital1 **] with bolus lasix prn
   - cont ASA, clopidogrel, carvedilol, CCB
   # HTN: Currently controlled. Home regimen includes BB and CCB.
   - cont home dose carvedilol, amlodipine 10mg
   #  Acute on Chronic kidney injury:  creatinine returning to baseline,
   today 1.5 from peak of 2.2 with aggressive diuresis.  Creatinine stable
   following cardiac catheterization.  Likely indicative of intravascular
   depletion.  Has had acute renal failure in setting of diuresis in past,
   including previous admission for CHF exacerbation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   #  MDS/ Chronic Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at
   baseline thought [**12-31**] myelodysplasia. Followed by Heme as outpatient. On
   Epo injections 20K at home.
   - trend hct
   - transfuse 1UpRBC to maintain Hct> 30
   - EPO 8,000 3x/week
   # Diabetes type 2: hyperglycemia improved with lantus dose
   - finger sticks qachs

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient doing very well this morning sitting in chair and without chest
   pain or shortness of breath. Patient successfully extubated yesterday
   at 3pm. Fluid balance is negative 1.8 L in 24 hours including a
   transfusion of 1 u PRBC in half packs. Hct now 35.5 vol%. Antianginal
   therapy has been increased by adding Imdur 90 mg QD in place of NT
   paste and he continues on Amlodipine 10 mg QD and coreg 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Creatinine stable at 1.5 mg/ dl. PLan is to maintain a negative fluid
   balance of 500 cc today and to increase Imdur to 120 mg QD if BP
   tolerates. Lasix will be changed back to him home diuretic dose of
   Bumex 2 mg Qam. OK to [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 3 later today if necessary.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2171-11-2**] 11:31 AM ------
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). He presented with shortness of breath and respiratory distress, which led to multiple episodes of pulmonary edema during his hospital stay. The patient required intubation twice due to respiratory failure caused by pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current condition includes chronic diastolic CHF, acute on chronic kidney injury, MDS/chronic normocytic anemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The medical team has initiated various treatments and interventions, including diuretics, cardiac catheterization, antianginal medications, blood transfusion, and adjustment of home medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Reoccurrence of respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema.
2. Worsening of chronic kidney injury.
3. Further deterioration of heart function leading to worsening CHF.
4. Hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled diabetes.
5. Bleeding complications due to the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.
6. Infection risks due to immunosuppression from diabetes and MDS.
