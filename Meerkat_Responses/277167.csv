","The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ethanol dependence and frequent admissions for ethanol intoxication, presenting with ethanol withdrawal and global pain. He is currently experiencing signs of withdrawal, including anxiety and tremors in his upper extremities. His CIWA score has been greater than 10 overnight, but there is a concern for potential exaggeration of symptoms. 

The patient has a history of seizures and delirium tremens. He is currently being treated with diazepam 10 mg IV every 1 hour as needed for CIWA score greater than 10, thiamine 100 mg daily, MVI 1 tablet orally once daily, folate 1 mg orally once daily, and monitoring for dehydration, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and alcoholic ketoacidosis.

The patient reports trauma from a motor vehicle accident four days ago for which he states he signed out against medical advice from Hospital1's ICU. There are no obvious signs of trauma on physical examination, and no fracture was observed on the chest X-ray. An attempt will be made to obtain records from Hospital1 for further imaging studies.

The patient has a history of alcoholic liver disease, as evidenced by improved AST and ALT levels today. No stigmata of liver disease are present on physical examination, and the INR is within normal range. Coagulation and liver function tests will be monitored.

The patient has iron deficiency anemia, which appears to be dilutional in"

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ethanol dependence and frequent admissions for ethanol intoxication. He presents with ethanol withdrawal and global pain. His chief complaint includes anxiety, feeling restless, and experiencing tremors. The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown medications. He is currently receiving diazepam for ethanol withdrawal symptoms, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 91/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, anxious, and diaphoretic. He has poor dentition and bilateral hand swelling without focal erythema or cyanosis. Neurologically, the patient is attentive but withdrawn.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 4.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, blood glucose level of 111 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests show elevated AST and ALT levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes alcoholic liver disease, recent motor vehicle accident, and iron deficiency anemia. He also has chronic bilateral upper extremity hand edema with an unclear etiology.

The patient's plan includes continuing diazepam for ethanol withdrawal symptoms, administering thiamine, multivitamins, and folate supplements. Fluid and electrolyte replacement is also important, especially monitoring for dehydration, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The patient will be evaluated by psychiatry and social work services.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening ethanol withdrawal symptoms
2. Inadequate treatment of pain
3. Development of delirium tremens
4. Hypomagnesemia
5. Hypokalemia
6. Alcoholic ketoacidosis
7. Liver failure
8. Infection due to immunosuppression
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheter use

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ethanol dependence and frequent admissions for ethanol intoxication. He presents with ethanol withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety and tremors. The patient has been at risk for complications due to his third day of abstinence from drinking and past history of seizures and delirium tremens.

The patient's current medications include diazepam 10 mg IV every 4 hours for anxiety, thiamine 100 mg daily, MVI 1 tablet orally once a day, folate 1 mg orally once a day, and monitoring and replacement of fluid and electrolytes. This includes watching for dehydration, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and alcoholic ketoacidosis.

Additionally, the patient reports trauma from a recent motor vehicle accident (MVA) four days ago, for which he states he signed out against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1's ICU. However, there are no obvious signs of trauma on physical examination, and no fractures were noted on the chest X-ray. Efforts will be made to obtain occupational health records for further imaging studies.

The patient also has a diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease, with improved AST and ALT levels today. No stigmata of liver disease were observed during the physical examination, and the INR is within normal range. Monitoring of coagulation parameters and liver function tests will continue.

Furthermore, the patient has anemia, specifically iron deficiency anemia, as indicated by baseline labs from"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of alcohol dependence and frequent admissions for alcohol intoxication. He presents with alcohol withdrawal and global pain. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times, including for a recent motor vehicle accident (MVA), although no obvious signs of trauma were found on physical examination. His laboratory results show mild anemia, normal liver function tests, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is currently on a benzodiazepine taper for alcohol withdrawal, pain medication as needed, thiamine, multivitamins, and folate supplementation. He is being monitored for dehydration, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and alcoholic ketoacidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcoholic ketoacidosis: This can occur due to alcohol withdrawal and dehydration.
2. Hypomagnesemia: The patient is at risk for this electrolyte imbalance, which can cause muscle cramps, weakness, and irregular heartbeat.
3. Hypokalemia: Another electrolyte imbalance that can result from alcohol use disorder and may lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: Prolonged hospital stay and immobility increase the risk of developing infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
5. Liver disease: Although the patient's liver function tests are currently normal, chronic alcohol abuse can lead to liver damage over time.
6. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can sometimes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of alcohol dependence and frequent admissions for alcohol intoxication. He presents with alcohol withdrawal and global pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has chronic chest pain, dyspnea, and severe pain. His laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient has been diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal, pain control (acute and chronic pain), anemia (iron deficiency anemia), and bilateral upper extremity hand edema of unclear etiology. He is currently being treated with diazepam, oxycodone, thiamine, multivitamins, folate, and fluid/electrolyte replacement. The patient also has a recent history of motor vehicle accident (MVA) and alcoholic liver disease. There are no obvious signs of trauma on physical examination, and his liver function tests are improving. He has a stable hemoglobin level and normal albumin levels, which suggests no significant liver dysfunction. The patient's nutritional and glycemic control are well-managed, and he is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the floor soon.
