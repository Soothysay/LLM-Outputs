   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On the night of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active [**Doctor First Name 9056**]
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile.
   - LR boluses prn. Hold on pressors.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline
   - f/u renal recs
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active [**Month/Year (2) 9056**] or
   A fib.
   - Holding diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - If Hct stable, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV for rate control.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - will need to touch base with ID regarding course
   - cont meropenem
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - clarify ID recs for indication for bronch
   - clarify ID reasoning for voriconazole given galactomannan and beta
   glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.
   .
   # HTN: Holding given hypotension.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS and basal glargine
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma, was admitted on [2165-2-25] and underwent a mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).
- The patient's hospital course has been complicated by various conditions, including Parainfluenza pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to gentamicin and contrast treated with hemodialysis (HD), right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient also experienced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with refractory anemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
- The patient developed atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) initially treated with heparin, which was later held due to iliopsoas hematoma.
- The patient had a massive transfusion and required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure.
- The patient underwent an emergency upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and was found to have a large duodenal ulcer with active bleeding, which was managed with endoscopic clipping.
- The patient also had a duodenal ulcer with clips falling off and ongoing bleeding"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On the night of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He has had a complicated hospital course, including parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, acute renal failure, and duodenal ulcer with gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient presented to the MICU with profuse bright red blood per rectum and hemodynamic instability, requiring emergent fluid resuscitation and packed red blood cell transfusions. He underwent an emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and had a large healing ulcer injected and clipped, which was the likely cause of the bleed. The patient required intermittent pressor support to maintain pressures.

On the night of [6-8], the patient became hypotensive with melena and needed an emergent EGD again. The clips fell out of the large duodenal ulcer, and it was actively oozing. The patient's Hct has been stable, and he has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells and 3 units of platelets since ICU transfer.

The patient has several ongoing issues, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypotension (resolved), respiratory failure (airway control), acute renal failure, ESBL E. coli urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, and non-gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's current vital signs include a"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**]. He has a complicated hospital course including parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, acute renal failure secondary to gentamicin and contrast treated with HD, right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected PE after developing AF with RVR initially treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteriuria, GVHD, and duodenal ulcer admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.

The patient presented with profuse bright red blood per rectum with hemodynamic instability, requiring emergent fluid resuscitation and pRBC transfusions. He underwent emergent EGD and was able to inject and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the bleed. He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain pressures. He received a total of 5U pRBC, 2 plts, and 5L IVF.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of duodenal ulcer with large clots, which were successfully treated with endoscopic intervention. He continues to bleed and requires ongoing monitoring and management.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current conditions, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been requiring intermittent pressor support to maintain pressures, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may be secondary to hypovolemia due to the gastrointestinal bleed or as a result of sedation following intubation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated emergently for airway protection. Current settings on the ventilator include a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. These settings will need to be adjusted based on the results of the arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.4 mg/dL, indicating possible ARF. The patient's fluid status and renal function will need to be closely monitored. Measures should be taken to avoid nephrotoxins and dose medications appropriately.

4. ESBL E. coli Bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli. Treatment with meropenem, an antibiotic effective against ESBL-producing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications and conditions. These include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient experienced a significant bleed from an ulcer in the duodenum, which required emergent endoscopy and intervention with endoclips to control the bleeding.

2. Hypotension: The patient required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure due to hypovolemia caused by the GI bleed.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. Current settings on the ventilator include a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.4, indicating possible acute renal failure, likely secondary to volume depletion from the GI bleed.

5. ESBL E.coli Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E.coli, for which he is receiving a 14-day course of meropenem.

6. Refractory Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a history of refractory multiple myeloma and has undergone a mini-allogeneic stem cell transplant. His condition is complicated by increasing immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation and is being monitored on telemetry.

8. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires wound care.

9. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension but is currently holding antihypertensive medications due to hypotension.

10. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and requires insulin therapy and basal glargine.

It is important to note that the patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of these multiple medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma admitted to the ICU. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by several conditions, including Parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and duodenal ulcer. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has required intermittent pressor support due to hypotension and has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of platelets, and 5 liters of intravenous fluids. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and he has a history of atrial fibrillation. He also has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for complications such as deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to the underlying conditions and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function due to hypotension, sepsis, and the use of nephrotoxic medications.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a risk of re-bleeding or progression of the bleed.

 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active bleeding
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - LR boluses prn. Hold on pressors.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline
   - f/u renal recs
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - If Hct stable, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV for rate control.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - will need to touch base with ID regarding course
   - cont meropenem
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - clarify ID recs for indication for bronch
   - clarify ID reasoning for voriconazole given galactomannan and beta
   glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who has undergone a mini-allogeneic stem cell transplant. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by parainfluenza pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) pneumonias and bacteremia treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, acute renal failure secondary to gentamicin and contrast treated with hemodialysis (off since 5-4), right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) after developing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient also had a central nervous system (CNS) infection treated with acyclovir, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and duodenal ulcer with gastrointestinal bleeding.

Currently, the patient is admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, requiring intermittent pressor support, and has a history of active bleeding. The patient has received emergent endoscopic treatment for a large healing ulcer, but clips fell out, and the patient is actively oozing. Surgery has determined that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate due to comorbidities. Both surgery and gastroenterology recommend possible interventional radiology (IR) embolization.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He has had a complicated hospital course, including Parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, ARF secondary to gentamicin and contrast, right basilic vein thrombus, suspected PE, AMS with negative LP, ESBL E. coli bacteriuria, GVHD, and duodenal ulcer with GI bleed. The patient is currently in the MICU for GI bleed management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had a large duodenal ulcer that caused profuse bright red blood per rectum. The ulcer was treated with endoscopic clips, but it is still actively oozing. Surgery deemed the patient a poor surgical candidate due to comorbidities, and both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization. The patient should continue to be monitored for signs of rebleeding and hypotension.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially required intermittent pressor support due to hypovolemia from the GI bleed. Pressors may be needed to maintain MAPS >65.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection. The ventilator settings should be adjusted based on ABG results. Weaning from the ventilator should be considered when the patient's condition stabilizes.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has ischemic ATN secondary to hypotension during the GI bleed. Renal function should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose medications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is currently in AFIB with rapid ventricular response. Rate control measures should be considered once the patient's bleeding risk stabilizes.
6. ESBL E. coli Bacteriuria: The patient is being treated with a 14-day course of meropenem. ID recommendations regarding the course should be clarified.
7. Fungal Infection: The patient has worsening opacities on CT, and ID recommended antifungal treatment. Clarification of ID recommendations and reasoning for voriconazole use is needed.
8. Refractory Multiple Myeloma: The patient's immunosuppression is increasing for GVHD. Restarting Etanercept and Tacrolimus should be discussed with BMT recommendations.
9. Stage 4 Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: Wound care management is necessary for the sacral decubitus ulcer.
10. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient should continue to wear boots for DVT prophylaxis.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - Started Metoprolol 50 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID). Will hold dilt
   90 mg QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - f/u H pylori
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient initially presented with
   oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was
   likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However, given
   prolonged hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN.
   In addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   # Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia (Na=132) and it
   complicated to tell if the volume status of the patient (hypovolemic
   vs. euvolemic vs. hypervolemic). Cr increased from 1.5
1.6.
   - check urine lytes
   - check PM lytes to see if hyponatremia worsened
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc.
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID. Will not
   taper methyl pred levels until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO. Still holding home dilt.
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.

   Disposition: Can leave ICU today after better rate control.
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is in AF with tachycardia and has been receiving medications such as Lopressor and diltiazem to control the rate.

2. Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleed: The patient had profuse bright red blood per rectum with hemodynamic instability. He underwent emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and had a large healing ulcer treated with endoclips. However, the patient experienced a re-bleeding episode due to the clips falling out, and another EGD was performed to place additional clips. Surgery recommended possible interventional radiology (IR) embolization due to the patient being a poor surgical candidate.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with oliguria and an elevated baseline creatinine of 1.5. The patient likely developed ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to prolonged hypotension and normal saline boluses. The patient's current serum creatinine is 1.6.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium level of 132. It is unclear whether the hyponatremia is"

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q8 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator. Doing well on
   minimal PS settings, RISBI 47.
   - SBT today, follow w/ ABG
   - check cuff leak, cough, then extubate if ok
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   .
   #. Oliguria: Low UOP in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5, may be volume
   depletion although has had aggressive fluid resuscitation. FeNa 0.04%
   previously.  However, given hypotension, the patient has likely
   developed ischemic ATN. In addition, developed a NAG metabolic
   acidosis, likely due to normal saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP after extubation
   .
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding home diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - cont to monitor on tele
   - increase to metoprolol IV 5 q4h
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - per ID: can d/c meropenam today
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.
   .
   # HTN: Holding given hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by various conditions, including parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, acute renal failure, right basilic vein thrombus, suspected pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient presented with profuse bright red blood per rectum and hemodynamic instability, requiring emergent fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, where a large healing ulcer was found and treated by injecting and clipping. However, the patient experienced a rebleeding episode with melanotic stool and required another emergent EGD, during which the previously placed clips fell out, and the ulcer continued to ooze. Surgery determined that the patient would not be a suitable candidate for surgical intervention, and interventional radiology (IR) embolization was recommended.

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure, with minimal settings on the ventilator and a recent hypotensive episode. Oliguria and worsening renal function have been observed, and the patient has developed a metabolic acidosis. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation is being withheld due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Additionally, the patient has a history of ES"

 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q8 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator. Doing well on
   minimal PS settings, RISBI 47.
   - SBT today, follow w/ ABG
   - check cuff leak, cough, then extubate if ok
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   .
   #. Oliguria: Low UOP in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5, may be volume
   depletion although has had aggressive fluid resuscitation. FeNa 0.04%
   previously.  However, given hypotension, the patient has likely
   developed ischemic ATN. In addition, developed a NAG metabolic
   acidosis, likely due to normal saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP after extubation
   .
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding home diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - cont to monitor on tele
   - increase to metoprolol IV 5 q4h
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - per ID: can d/c meropenam today
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He has had a complicated hospital course, including parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, acute renal failure, right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected pulmonary embolism. The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding, upper (melena), and impaired skin integrity. He is currently admitted to the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had profuse bright red blood per rectum with hemodynamic instability. Despite receiving emergent fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, he experienced another episode of GI bleeding with melanotic stools. A large healing ulcer in the duodenum was identified as the likely cause of the bleed. The patient underwent endoscopic treatment, but the clips fell out, and the ulcer continued to bleed. Both surgery and GI recommend possible interventional radiology (IR) embolization.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated emergently for airway protection due to respiratory failure. Although he is comfortable on the ventilator, he had a recent hypotensive episode, and it is planned to continue mechanical ventilation. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be performed today, followed by weaning if successful.

3. Oliguria: The patient has low urine output (UOP) in"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He has had several complications during his hospital course, including parainfluenza pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, acute kidney injury (ARF) secondary to gentamicin and contrast treated with hemodialysis (HD), right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) after developing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He also had acute-on-chronic renal failure and hyponatremia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and refractory multiple myeloma.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He requires intermittent pressor support to maintain his blood pressure and has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to his inability to eat.

The patient has several medical conditions that require ongoing management, including atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and refractory multiple myeloma. He is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, immunosuppressants, and medications for his other medical conditions.

   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - cont metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg
   QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - decide when pt can ADAT per BMT recs, otherwise NPO except meds
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - H pylori negative
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure / hyponatremia: Patient initially
   presented with oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%),
   which was likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However,
   given prolonged hypotension, the patient had also developed ischemic
   ATN. Now with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11 c/w SIADH.
   Initially may have been [**12-17**] extubation, however, now etiologies unclear
   but may include pulmonary process, malignancy, pain, intracranial
   process (unlikely)
   - free water restrict 1L
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc (bc on tacro).
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H. Will not taper methyl pred levels
   until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   .
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt per above.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # ID:
   --Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   - ? new lingular infiltrate vs atalectasis on CXR, clinically stable
   for now, so will repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   -- ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - On metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO except meds
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient initially presented with
   oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was
   likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However, given
   prolonged hypotension, the patient had also developed ischemic ATN. Now
   with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   # Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia (Na=132) and it
   complicated to tell if the volume status of the patient (hypovolemic
   vs. euvolemic vs. hypervolemic). Cr increased from 1.5
1.6. FeNa 1.9,
   Uosm>500. ? SIADH [**12-17**] ventilation.
   .
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc (bc on tacro).
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H. Will not taper methyl pred levels
   until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   .
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS
