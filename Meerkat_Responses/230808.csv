","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) presenting with abdominal discomfort, poor oral intake, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is currently in AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rate control in AFib: The patient's AFib may be poorly controlled, potentially due to infection and dehydration. The goal is to achieve rate control without cardioversion, as the patient has declined this option. Amiodarone and digoxin have been initiated for rate control.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely multifactorial, including possible sepsis, poor oral intake, and AFib with RVR. Phenylephrine infusion has been started to support blood pressure, and fluid restriction has been implemented.

3. Infection: Elevated lactate, mildly elevated white blood cell count, and elevated LFTs indicate possible infection. Chest X-ray shows a possible infiltrate, and antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and levofloxacin has been initiated. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and final read of CXR are pending.

4. Pulmonary edema: The patient initially presented as dry but now appears wet after receiving 2 liters of intravenous fluids. Chest X-ray is consistent with pulmonary edema, and the use of lasix may need to be reconsidered"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) who presents with abdominal discomfort, poor oral intake, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and found to be in AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) with hypotension. The hypotension is likely secondary to dehydration and poor oral intake. 

The patient's rate control for AFib is being managed with digoxin and amiodarone. The hypotension has resolved with controlled heart rate and diuresis. Pneumonia is suspected based on the elevated lactate levels, and appropriate antibiotics have been started. Pulmonary edema has developed, and diuretics are being resumed. Hyponatremia has resolved, likely due to hypovolemic causes and poor oral intake.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and falls, so anticoagulation with heparin or Coumadin is being held. The patient has declined central venous line placement.

Other medical conditions and their management include:

1. AFib: Rate control with digoxin and amiodarone.
2. Hypotension: Resolved with controlled heart rate and diuresis.
3. Pneumonia: Suspected, antibiotics (Vanc/Levo) are being continued, awaiting sputum and blood culture results.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation who presents with abdominal discomfort, poor oral intake, and elevated liver function tests. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, likely secondary to dehydration. The patient received an amiodarone bolus and was restarted on chronic dosing, as well as started on digoxin. She has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 96/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a JVD of 10cm, crackles midway up the back bilaterally, 2+ edema to mid-calves bilaterally, warm well-perfused extremities, and stasis dermatitis bilaterally. Her labs show an elevated ALT, AST, AP, and TB, as well as low Mg and INR. The patient's assessment includes atrial fibrillation, hypotension, pneumonia, abdominal pain, and hyponatremia. The plan includes attempting rate control for atrial fibrillation, restarting Lasix at half the home dose due to evidence of CHF on CXR, obtaining U/A and culture for pneumonia, and resuming diuresis. The patient's hyponatremia has resolved,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with abdominal discomfort, poor oral intake, elevated liver function tests, and found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, likely secondary to dehydration. The patient has a long-standing history of atrial fibrillation and may have poorly controlled rate in the setting of infection and dehydration. The patient does not want cardioversion and has a fall risk with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim is to rate control using amiodarone and digoxin.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: Rate control measures include amiodarone 100mg daily and PO digoxin. The patient does not want direct current cardioversion due to stroke risk and has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin 325mg daily will be given, while holding on heparin/coumadin due to fall risk and history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) pending.
2. Hypotension: Resolved with controlled heart rate and the initiation of lasix for diuresis.
3. Pneumonia: Continue vancomycin/levofloxacin. Urine and blood cultures pending.
4. Pulmonary Edema: Resume diuresis.
5. Hyponatremia: Resolved with 2 liters of intravenous fluids given in the emergency department. Likely hypovolemic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with abdominal discomfort, poor oral intake, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She was found to be in AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension, likely secondary to dehydration. The patient has a long-standing history of AF and may have poorly controlled rate in the setting of infection and dehydration. She has not been on coumadin since August 2nd due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and fall risk. The patient also declines cardioversion at this time. Rate control is the primary goal for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dehydration: The patient's hypotension and poor oral intake suggest ongoing dehydration. This could lead to further electrolyte imbalances and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient has signs of pneumonia with crackles in the lungs, elevated lactate levels, and pending cultures. Infection can worsen her overall condition and potentially lead to sepsis.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: Although the patient does not have a history of systolic or diastolic dysfunction, the recent development of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray suggests cardiac involvement. This may indicate worsening heart failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and current use of aspirin and lansoprazole increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Fall risk: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (a.fib) who presents with abdominal discomfort, poor oral intake, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She is found to be in a.fib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension, likely secondary to dehydration. The patient has multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and possible pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's CXR shows evidence of pulmonary edema, indicating fluid overload. This can lead to worsening CHF symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema.

2. Kidney injury or failure: The patient's low urine output (940 mL in 24 hours) and elevated creatinine levels indicate possible kidney dysfunction. Dehydration, poor perfusion, and medications like amiodarone can contribute to kidney injury or failure.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as crackles in the lungs and elevated white blood cell count, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This infection needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.

4. Liver dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) may indicate liver injury or dysfunction. Infections, medications, and dehydration can all contribute to liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as coag"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (a.fib) who presented with abdominal discomfort, poor oral intake, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and was found to be in a.fib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) with hypotension, likely secondary to dehydration.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a known history of a.fib and is currently experiencing RVR. Rate control measures are being attempted, including the use of amiodarone and digoxin.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved but may require further management, especially considering the evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) on the chest X-ray.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's lactate levels have improved on vancomycin and levofloxacin, indicating a potential improvement in pneumonia. Urine analysis and culture, as well as blood cultures, are pending.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and her LFTs are improving. A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed contracted gallbladder with multiple stones, but no signs of cholecystitis.
5. Lasix Administration: The patient's Lasix dose has been increased to the home dose of 20mg due to evidence of CHF on the chest X-ray.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation who presents with abdominal discomfort, poor oral intake, elevated liver function tests, and found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, likely secondary to dehydration.

The patient's current medications include amiodarone, digoxin, metoprolol, aspirin, lansoprazole, levofloxacin, furosemide, heparin, traZODONE, mirtazapine, paroxetine, senna, docusate sodium, simethicone, and influenza virus vaccine.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's conditions and medications include:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently on a 7-day course of Levo. There is a concern for continued infection due to her need for supplemental oxygen.

2. Dehydration: The patient's hypotension and elevated liver function tests suggest possible dehydration. Fluid balance should be closely monitored, and IV fluids may be required.

3. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation showed hypotension, which has since resolved. However, it is important to continue monitoring her blood pressure and adjust medications accordingly.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control measures have been implemented, including amiodarone and metop"
