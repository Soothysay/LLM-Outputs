","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the trauma service with an ethanol-related fall, intracranial bleed, and four-minute ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was discharged from the trauma service two days ago and was readmitted with increasing confusion and lethargy, as well as fever at the rehabilitation facility. The patient's current condition includes fever, altered mental status, and a history of subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. He is currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but with the worsening of symptoms, broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) are being considered for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The patient also has a history of scapular fracture, ethanol abuse, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, altered mental status, and history of subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage may indicate an ongoing infectious process. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover both CAP and HCAP.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status can be attributed to delirium from febrile illness or changes associated with increasing subdural hematoma. Further evaluation is needed to differentiate between these possibilities.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol use admitted to the ICU for suspected myelinolysis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is unresponsive to commands. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has received ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia, as well as lorazepam and haloperidol for agitation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 798 mL. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol use and was previously admitted for similar symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Myelinolysis: The patient's symptoms and history of chronic alcohol use suggest the possibility of myelinolysis. If not managed appropriately, the condition can lead to further neurological deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection and ensuring appropriate treatment is crucial to prevent complications.
3. Agitation and Delirium: The patient has received medications for agitation, indicating potential delirium."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the trauma service after falling and suffering from an intracranial bleed. He had a 4-minute ventricular fibrillation arrest and was found to have increasing confusion and lethargy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert and oriented but has intermittent confusion regarding his location. Neurological examination reveals mild increased tone in the right lower extremity, mild resting tremor in the right hand, and normal cranial nerve function. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose is within normal range, but liver enzymes are elevated. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and has been discharged from the trauma service. He is currently being treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a suspected case of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a central fever, which could be due to an infectious etiology or a complication of the intracranial bleed. Further work-up, including blood and urine cultures, is necessary to determine the cause of the fever.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the trauma service with an ethanol-related fall, intracranial bleed, and a 4-minute ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was discharged from the trauma service two days ago and presented with increasing confusion and lethargy, as well as fever at the rehabilitation unit. 

On examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs detected. His respiratory system is clear bilaterally, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender without distension. There is no peripheral edema noted. 

Neurologically, the patient is awake and alert but slow, cooperative with the exam, and oriented to person intermittently to date but not to place. He has fluent speech with normal comprehension and repetition, intact naming, and no dysarthria. His cranial nerves are intact, and his motor examination shows mildly increased tone in the right upper extremity with a mild resting tremor in the right hand. Coordination is normal, and gait is deferred. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood cultures are negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was discharged from trauma service two days ago after being admitted with an ethanol-related fall, intracranial bleed, and a four-minute ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient is currently experiencing increasing confusion and lethargy at a rehabilitation center in the setting of ever and right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient has a fever, and the work-up includes urine, ruling out pneumonia (HCAP vs aspiration) given concern for a prior radiograph for pneumonic process. The patient does not have any indwelling lines remaining. The patient's white blood cell count is normal without leukocytosis or left shift. Empirical antibiotic coverage will be provided (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) to cover for potential hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration. Ceftriaxone will also cover for urinary tract infection (clx data negative at this point). The antibiotic course will be completed for five days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium from febrile illness with superimposed changes associated with increasing subdural hematoma.
2. Increasing edema from right parenchymal bleed on a backdrop of ethanol abuse.
3. Seizure prophylaxis due to the presence of subarachnoid/subdural hemorrhage.
4. Hypertension management.
5. Scapular fracture management.
6. Potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the trauma service and then transferred to the ICU due to an intracranial bleed, a fall, and a history of alcohol (EtOH) abuse. He presented with increasing confusion and lethargy at a rehabilitation center, and there were concerns about a right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient has been febrile since admission, and his fever is central in origin, possibly due to an incranial bleed or an infectious etiology. There are no indwelling lines remaining.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's altered mental status may be caused by delirium from febrile illness with superimposed changes associated with increasing subdural hematoma, or increasing edema from a right parenchymal bleed on a background of EtOH abuse. The patient is currently oriented, so neuro checks will be done every 4 hours, and Haldol will be administered as needed, following QT monitoring. The attending neurosurgeon has reviewed the films and does not recommend acute surgical management at this time. Dilantin 300mg IV will be redosed.

The patient has a history of hypertension, for which he is taking losartan and norvasc. Diuretics are being withheld until more records are obtained. The patient also has a scapular fracture, which will be managed by the trauma service. Other issues mentioned in the ICU resident's note are being addressed"

   FINDINGS: Since the prior examination, there is slight increase in size
   of
   what is likely a left cerebral hemispheric subdural hygroma causing
   mild
   effacement of the cerebral sulci, but no shift of normally midline
   structures.
   The hemorrhages seen in the region of the septum pellucidum appear to
   have
   resolved but there is persistence of the small right parietal
   hemorrhage with
   surrounding edema, as well as the FLAIR images showing what is likely
   subacute
   subarachnoid hemorrhage. There are no abnormalities on the diffusion
   images
   to suggest acute brain ischemia. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of
   normally midline structures.
   The principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is
   redemonstration
   of a small, polypoid area of mucosal thickening in the mid-ethmoid
   sinus on
   the right side.
   CONCLUSION: Mild increase in size of left cerebral convexity subdural
   hygroma. See above report for additional findings.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the trauma service after falling and suffering from an intracranial bleed. He was discharged from the trauma service two days ago and is now in the ICU due to increasing confusion and lethargy, as well as a fever. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on various medications including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a central fever, which could be due to an intracranial bleed or an infectious etiology. Further work-up is needed to rule out pneumonia and determine the cause of the fever.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing confusion and lethargy, which could be caused by delirium from a febrile illness, changes associated with increasing subdural hematoma (SDH), or increasing edema from a right parenchymal bleed. Regular neuro checks and an EEG have been ordered to evaluate for non-convulsive status epilepticus.
3. Subarachnoid/Subdural Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of subarach"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and altered mental status. The patient has a history of trauma, pneumonia, and a fracture. On the day of admission, an EKG showed some changes, and the neurology team was consulted. The possible etiology for the changes in mental status includes pneumonia, ativan administration, liver dysfunction, and the impact of a hygroma, SAH, and right parietal bleed with edema. The recommended course of action includes infectious workup, EEG, and neurological checks every four hours.

Infusions include pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include ceftriaxone, which was given as a last dose at 02:00 PM on the day of admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,780 mL and output of 1,105 mL, resulting in a balance of 675 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. The patient's peripheral pulses are not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the trauma service with an ethanol-related fall, intracranial bleed, and a 4-minute ventricular fibrillation arrest. He has been experiencing increasing confusion and lethargy, as well as fever during his rehabilitation. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, and a recent scapular fracture. He is currently in the ICU receiving various medications including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and more.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's fever could be due to an infectious etiology or a central cause related to the intracranial bleed. Further work-up is needed, including urine and blood cultures.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to delirium caused by the febrile illness or due to increasing subdural hematoma (SDH) and edema from a right parenchymal bleed. Frequent neurologic checks are recommended, and consideration should be given to performing a lumbar puncture (LP) if there is a spike in temperature.
3. Subarachnoid/Subdural Hemorrhage: The neurosurgical plan does not currently include acute surgical management. The patient should be redosed with dilantin 300mg IV x1 and an MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

   FINDINGS: Since the prior examination, there is slight increase in size
   of
   what is likely a left cerebral hemispheric subdural hygroma causing
   mild
   effacement of the cerebral sulci, but no shift of normally midline
   structures.
   The hemorrhages seen in the region of the septum pellucidum appear to
   have
   resolved but there is persistence of the small right parietal
   hemorrhage with
   surrounding edema, as well as the FLAIR images showing what is likely
   subacute
   subarachnoid hemorrhage. There are no abnormalities on the diffusion
   images
   to suggest acute brain ischemia. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of
   normally midline structures.
   The principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is
   redemonstration
   of a small, polypoid area of mucosal thickening in the mid-ethmoid
   sinus on
   the right side.
   CONCLUSION: Mild increase in size of left cerebral convexity subdural
   hygroma. See above report for additional findings.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the trauma service after falling and sustaining an intracranial bleed. He had a 4-minute ventricular fibrillation arrest and was found to have increasing confusion and lethargy. The patient is currently in the ICU with a fever, and his mental status has been fluctuating. He has a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and a recent fatty liver condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is showing signs of increased edema from a right parenchymal bleed. His neurologic exam reveals mild increased tone in the left arm and leg, as well as a mild resting tremor in the right hand. Imaging shows a slight increase in size of a left cerebral hemispheric subdural hygroma and no midline shift. There are also findings of subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits, except for elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious etiology: The patient's fever and confusion may indicate an infection, which needs to be ruled out.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): Although no indwelling lines remain, there is a history of central line use, making this a potential complication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man who was recently discharged from the trauma service after a fall resulting in an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). He was also experiencing a ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient presented with increased confusion at a rehabilitation facility, and his wife reported that he had been more confused recently. He was then transferred to an outside hospital, where he was febrile and treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient had altered mental status, described as stable but waxing and waning. His vital signs were within normal limits, although his blood pressure was on the lower side. He had right lower extremity edema and trace left lower extremity edema. The patient's respiratory support included supplemental oxygen, but he did not require mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Imaging revealed a possible infiltrate in the right lower lobe of the lung, which could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia. The patient's cultures were negative to date. The assessment and plan included altered mental status, fracture of an unspecified body part, pneumonia, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient continued to be on empiric therapy for pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI), and an EEG was pending. He received prophylactic he"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with altered mental status, possibly due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). He has a history of pneumonia and UTI, for which he is receiving empiric antibiotic therapy. His vital signs are stable, and he is being monitored closely in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening infection or respiratory distress.
2. UTI: The patient may require further evaluation and treatment for urinary tract infection, especially considering his altered mental status.
3. SAH: The patient's neurological condition should be closely monitored, as SAH can lead to complications such as increased intracranial pressure or seizures.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility. Prophylactic measures, such as boots and subcutaneous heparin, should be continued.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's risk for pressure ulcers should be assessed, and measures should be taken to prevent them.
6. Medication interactions: With the patient's multiple medications, there is a risk of drug interactions. Regular monitoring and adjustment of medications may be necessary.
7. Infection control: The patient's environment should be maintained to prevent nosocomial infections. Hand hygiene and appropriate isolation precautions should be followed.
8. Nutritional support: The patient's nutritional status should be evaluated"
