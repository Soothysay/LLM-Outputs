","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with hypertension and active tobacco use who presented to her primary care physician (PCP) with flu-like symptoms. She was found to be hypoxemic and hypotensive, leading to intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Despite receiving paralytics and maximum ventilatory support, the patient continues to experience persistent hypoxemia and acidosis. A chest X-ray revealed multi-focal infiltrates.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/57 mmHg to 119/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus tachycardia, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 11,389 mL and output of 1,140 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 10,249 mL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including norepinephrine, vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, cisatracurium, and other ICU medications. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.16, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 56 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 18 mEq/L, and base excess (-9). The respiratory system is supported by a ventilator set at a tidal volume (Vt) of 360 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 34 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%.

The physical examination reveals an intubated and sedated patient with normal pupils, normocephalic head, and symmetric chest expansion. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), lactate, and low sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphorus (PO4). The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory failure and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's assessment and plan include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute respiratory failure, and other conditions. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, electrolyte imbalance, and fluid disorder."

   -esophageal balloon placed.  On VC 360/35/18/0.8, trans-pulmonary
   pressure and end expiration 4 cm H20, plateau now 30.  Will keep her on
   current ventilator settings but titrate down FiO2 to goal PaO2 >55.
   Currently at 6cc/kg but unable to decrease tidal volume further given
   persistent acidosis, and at RR 34 has auto-PEEP 1
   -continue bicarbonate drip for now
   -aim to keep fluid balance net even
   -current on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for CAP with vancomycin,
   ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.  Will increase antibiotic doses for
   normal GFR given Cr 4 to 2 in 24 hours
   -tamiflu dose titrate up to 150mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -has nasal respiratory viral panel pending, would send deep tracheal
   aspirate for respiratory viral panel and to state lab for H1N1 PCR
   -send sputum also for legionella culture
   -will re-evaluate need for paralytics in PM
   Shock, likely septic given CVO2 83%
   -continue vasopressin for now
   -adequately volume repleted given lack of respiratory variation on
   a-line, would not give additional volume for now
   Acute renal failure now improving with volume resuscitation
   -urine output 1100cc over 4 hours
   -dose antibiotics as above
   Diarrhea
   -empiric flagyl until C. difficile back, will switch to po formulation
   Non gap acidosis
   -given normal lactate and hyperchloremia this is likely related to
   normal saline resuscitation
   -bicarbonate drip for now but will wean to off

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and active tobacco use who presented to her primary care physician with flu-like symptoms and loose stools on December 14th. She was found to be hypoxemic and hypotensive, and subsequently intubated for hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by multi-focal infiltrate on chest X-ray, acute renal failure with creatinine of 4.5, and shock, likely septic given a central venous oxygen saturation (CVO2) of 83%.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, likely secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (including Legionella as a consideration) versus influenza (seasonal or H1N1). She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 360 mL, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 80%. Efforts are being made to wean down FiO2 while maintaining a PaO2 greater than 55.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is also likely experiencing septic shock, evidenced by a CVO2 of 83%. She is receiving vasopressin for support, but her blood pressure remains low. Fluid balance is being closely monitored, and efforts are being made to keep her adequately volume-repleted.

   -esophageal balloon placed.  On VC 360/35/18/0.8, trans-pulmonary
   pressure and end expiration 4 cm H20, plateau now 30.  Will keep her on
   current ventilator settings but titrate down FiO2 to goal PaO2 >55.
   Currently at 6cc/kg but unable to decrease tidal volume further given
   persistent acidosis, and at RR 34 has auto-PEEP 1
   -continue bicarbonate drip for now
   -aim to keep fluid balance net even
   -current on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for CAP with vancomycin,
   ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.  Will increase antibiotic doses for
   normal GFR given Cr 4 to 2 in 24 hours
   -tamiflu dose titrate up to 150mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -has nasal respiratory viral panel pending, would send deep tracheal
   aspirate for respiratory viral panel and to state lab for H1N1 PCR
   -send sputum also for legionella culture
   -will re-evaluate need for paralytics in PM
   Shock, likely septic given CVO2 83%
   -continue vasopressin for now
   -adequately volume repleted given lack of respiratory variation on
   a-line, would not give additional volume for now
   Acute renal failure now improving with volume resuscitation
   -urine output 1100cc over 4 hours
   -dose antibiotics as above
   Diarrhea
   -empiric flagyl until C. difficile back, will switch to po formulation
   Non gap acidosis
   -given normal lactate and hyperchloremia this is likely related to
   normal saline resuscitation
   -bicarbonate drip for now but will wean to off

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan with the following
   modifcations/emphasis:
   58 year old female with longstanding smoking history who presented with
   cough, fevers, shortness of breath and ultimately progressed to
   respiratory failure and shock.  She was intubated in the ED with
   bilateral infiltrates with air bronchograms seen on radiograph.  Of
   note, prior to intubation, the patient did not have any non-respiratory
   related complaints, had no abdominal pain and had a benign abdominal
   exam.  She was transferred to the ICU on multiple pressors and
   ventilatory support.
   Overnight, patient was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, IVFs,
   vasopressors, central and arterial lines were placed, was paralyzed and
   Fio2 of 1.0 PEEP of 24.  She ultimately came down off her pressors with
   the exception of vasopressin and her PEEP was decreased as well as
   oxygenation markedly improved.  She remains persistently febrile.
   T 39  P 90  BP 100/40  RR 32  Sat: 95% on Fio2 1.0  PEEP 18
   Intubated, sedated, paralyzed
   Chest: CTA bilaterally

   Abd: soft NT ND
   Ext: no edema or cyanosis
   Labs: Reviewed and as above
   CXR: bilateral infiltrates with airbronchograms.  ETT high

   down
   Assessment:
   1)       Acute Respiratory Failure/ARDS likely secondary to Pneumonia
   2)       Pneumonia
   3)       Septic Shock
   4)       Acute Renal Failure
   Discussion: Overall, patient picture consistent with severe pneumonia
   with associated ARDS.  Her prodrome was completely respiratory-related
   thus making a secondary source of ARDS (ie., abdominal source for
   example) unlikely.  Additionally, she is currently too unstable for
   transport to CT scan for any further imaging.  From a respiratory
   standpoint, she has had some marginal improvement overnight and her
   oxygenation is improving.  Her vasopressor requirement is also
   improving and her signs of perfusion (urine output and lactate) are
   good.
   Plan:
   1-       Continue Broad-spectrum antibiotics covering for community
   acquired pneumonia plus MRSA-pneumonia
   2-       Anti-viral therapy in case of flu
   3-       Pan-culture results pending and will follow
   4-       Maintain low tidal volume ventilation with goal PlatPres < 30
   5-       Will hook up vigileo for CO/Scvo2 monitoring and continue to
   monitor endpoints of resuscitation including lactate/urine output which
   currently are adequate
 she appears to have adequate preload based on
   the total volume given plus perfusion endpoints plus bedside ECHO
   showing IVC that does not collapse and appears distended.
   6-       Formal bedside ECHO (bedside ECHO performed by me revealed
   normal function and no effusion)
   7-       Maintain PEEP at current level -> if oxygenation improves then
   will decrease slowly.  Esophageal balloon being placed
   8-       If persistent hypotension, will check cortisol level and
   consider corticosteroids

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and active tobacco use. She presented with flu-like symptoms, loose stools, hypoxemia, and hypotension.
- She was intubated for hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure and diagnosed with multi-focal infiltrate on chest X-ray.
- The patient has been receiving maximum ventilatory support, paralytics, and vasopressors including norepinephrine, vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, and cisatracurium.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover for community-acquired pneumonia, including coverage for MRSA, and influenza.
- The patient's renal function has improved with an increase in urine output.
- There are concerns about the possibility of H1N1 infection, and tests are pending.
- The patient remains febrile and is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation suggests ARDS due to severe pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and requirement for multiple vasopressors indicate septic shock. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and perfusion endpoints is essential.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, but there is improvement with increased urine output.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and active tobacco use. She presented to her primary care physician with flu-like symptoms and loose stools three days ago. She was found to be hypoxemic and hypotensive, leading to intubation for hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She also has multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray and acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 4.5. The patient has been on maximum ventilatory support, paralytics, levophed, dopamine, and phenylephrine drips for hypertension. She is currently in the MICU on FiO2 100% with PEEP 15 and paralytics.

24-hour events include the placement of a femoral arterial line, initiation of bicarbonate drip, weaning of pressors to vasopressin alone, and initiation of empiric coverage for C. difficile and H1N1.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with ARDS, likely secondary to community-acquired pneumonia or influenza (possibly H1N1). She requires continued ventilatory support with a goal PaO2 >55, and her fluid balance should be kept even. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for CAP is being administered, along with titration of tamiflu dosage based on H1N1 concerns. Respiratory viral panel and H1N1 PCR tests are pending.

The patient is also in shock, likely septic,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis, organ dysfunction, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and acute respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and a gallstone at the neck of the gallbladder. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and zosyn. She is also receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she requires close monitoring and continued aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis-related organ failure syndrome (ROS): Due to the presence of severe sepsis, there is a risk of multiple organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic dysfunction.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure and diffuse airspace consolidation on imaging suggest a high risk for developing ARDS, which can lead to significant hypoxemia and respiratory support requirements.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which can be caused by various organisms including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
4. Cholecystitis: The presence of a gallstone at the neck of the gallbladder raises concern for cholecystitis,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with symptoms of cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, and now has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has a history of gallstone, which is causing distension of the gallbladder and the presence of pericholecystic fluid. Additionally, the patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The presence of multifocal opacities on the chest X-ray indicates the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated, this can lead to worsening ARDS and sepsis.

2. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and bandemia are consistent with sepsis. If not promptly treated, sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ failure.

3. Cholecystitis: The distended gallbladder and pericholecystic fluid seen on CT suggest the possibility of cholecystitis. If not addressed, this can lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture or abscess formation.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The significant decrease in creatinine levels from 4.5 to 1.0 indicates an improvement in kidney function. However, the initial high creatinine level suggests pre"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of cough, fever, and malaise. She presented with hypotension and hypoxia and is now diagnosed with ARDS. The patient has multifocal opacities on CXR and marked leukocytosis with bandemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/ARDS: The patient's severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings suggests the possibility of ARDS. The precipitating triggers include bacterial or viral pneumonia. Gallbladder distension is also considered as a potential ARDS precipitator, although less likely.
2. Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of sepsis such as tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and bandemia. The presence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR further supports this diagnosis. Health care-associated risk factors should be evaluated.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ARDS:  CXR with multifocal opacities, patient with severe
   hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings.  Clinical story,
   CXR, and oxygenation c/w ARDS.  Concerning precipitating triggers
   include bacterial vs. viral pneumonia.  With Gall bladder distension,
   also considering cholycystitis as ARDS precipitator, although less
   likely. Patient p/w fever, cough, marked leukocytosis with bandemia.
   Oxygenation improving from admission, and able to back down on PEEP and
   FIO2.
   - ween PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Sputum cultures w/ GPCs, will f/u s/s
   - r/o flu, empiric tamiflu rx for now.  Will need to resend flu DFA
   - cont empiric coverage with [**Month/Day/Year **]/ /levoflox for severe CAP, narrow
   antibiotics from zosyn to ctx
   - patient's current TV c/w ARDS net.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Patient with tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis and
   bandemia.  CXR with multifocal pneumonia, and now health care risk
   factors.
   - cont levo/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] switch zosyn back to ctx
   - send sputum cx
   - cont tamiflu
   - nasal swab repeat
   - will stop empiric flagyl for cdiff once stool neg x 1, as no colitis
   on CT.  Send stool cultures.
   .
   # Gallstone:  Distended gallbladder with suggestion of pericholecystic
   fluid and gallbladder stone seen in the region of the neck seen on CT.
   No significant abnormalities of LFTs and no symptoms prior to suggest
   cholysystitis.
   - f/u RUQ u/s
   - will stop zosyn.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with complaints of cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, and now has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The preliminary CT torso shows a gallstone at the neck of the gallbladder, gallbladder distension, pericholecystic fluid, and trace stranding. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated with bandemia, and there are findings of diffuse airspace consolidation on the chest X-ray. The sputum culture shows budding yeast with pseudohyphae and gram-positive cocci in pairs.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, zosyn, metronidazole, levofloxacin, and piperacillin. She is currently on vasopressin, midazolam, norepinephrine, and fentanyl infusions. Other medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/59 mmHg to 143/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is 81%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 15"

   Assessment and Plan
   ARDS
   -unclear trigger, community acquired pneumonia (including legionella as
   a consideration) vs influenza (seasonal vs H1N1)
   -esophageal balloon placed.  On VC 360/35/18/0.8, trans-pulmonary
   pressure and end expiration 4 cm H20, plateau now 30.  Will keep her on
   current ventilator settings but titrate down FiO2 to goal PaO2 >55.
   Currently at 6cc/kg but unable to decrease tidal volume further given
   persistent acidosis, and at RR 34 has auto-PEEP 1
   -continue bicarbonate drip for now
   -aim to keep fluid balance net even
   -current on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for CAP with vancomycin,
   ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.  Will increase antibiotic doses for
   normal GFR given Cr 4 to 2 in 24 hours
   -tamiflu dose titrate up to 150mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -has nasal respiratory viral panel pending, would send deep tracheal
   aspirate for respiratory viral panel and to state lab for H1N1 PCR
   -send sputum also for legionella culture
   -will re-evaluate need for paralytics in PM
   Shock, likely septic given CVO2 83%
   -continue vasopressin for now
   -adequately volume repleted given lack of respiratory variation on
   a-line, would not give additional volume for now
   Acute renal failure now improving with volume resuscitation
   -urine output 1100cc over 4 hours
   -dose antibiotics as above
   Diarrhea
   -empiric flagyl until C. difficile back, will switch to po formulation
   Non gap acidosis
   -given normal lactate and hyperchloremia this is likely related to
   normal saline resuscitation
   -bicarbonate drip for now but will wean to off

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of active tobacco use and hypertension. She was admitted with flu-like symptoms and dyspnea, and later intubated for hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient also has septic shock and acute renal failure. The preliminary CT chest shows multifocal consolidation and free fluid around the gallbladder. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for community-acquired pneumonia, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. She is also receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine for shock, as well as bicarbonate drip for non-gap acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's respiratory failure and need for intubation suggest the possibility of ARDS. The ventilator settings indicate that she is being weaned off paralytics and FiO2 is being titrated down to maintain PaO2 >55.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has signs of septic shock, indicated by the need for vasopressin and norepinephrine. The CVO2 of 83% suggests inadequate tissue perfusion.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and the need for volume resuscitation to improve urine output.

4. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of active tobacco use and hypertension. She was admitted with flu-like symptoms and dyspnea and later developed severe respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also had septic shock and acute renal failure. She has been diagnosed with ARDS likely due to bacterial pneumonia, and there is a suspicion of influenza involvement. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 14 cmH2O and FiO2 of 60%. She is also receiving vasopressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as regular lung secretion clearance and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures, such as heparin subcutaneous injections, should be implemented.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive devices increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Frequent monitoring and proper infection control practices are essential.
4. Delirium: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving sedatives and being mechanically ventilated, are at risk of developing delirium. Regular cognitive assessments and minimizing sedation as tolerated are crucial"

   -continue to wean PEEP.  When FiO250% (we are here now) and PEEP<8 we
   can liberalize her from ARDSnet ventilation
   -continue empiric coverage for severe CAP with ceftriaxone, levaquin,
   and vancomycin.  Would dose vancomycin to normal renal function
   -continue tamflu until H1N1 PCR back from state lab
   -followup blood and sputum cultures
   Vasopressor dependent shock
   -levophed being weaned down, still on vasopressin.  Will minimize
   sedation as tolerated
   -no significant respiratory variation on a-line tracing, does not
   require further fluid boluses at this [**Doctor First Name **]

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan with the following
   emphasis/modifications:
   Overnight, had CT scan which shows multi-focal infiltrates consistent
   with pneumonia and also showed gallstone with some edema, unclear if
   chole.  Ultrasound is pending.  Oxygenation improving and vasopressors
   able to be weaned somewhat.
   Vital Signs as above

   Intubated, sedated
   Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
   Heart: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: soft NT ND
   Ext: no edema
   Labs: as above plus outside hospital with strep in blood cultures
   Assessment:
   1)       Pneumonia
   2)       Acute Respiratory Failure
   3)       Septic Shock
   4)       Acute Renal Failure
   5)       Gallbladder edema
   Discussion: Overall, patient is slowly improving both in terms of
   oxygenation and vasopressor requirements.  The most likely diagnosis is
   pneumonia with septic shock and now has strep in the bloodstream which
   is also consistent with that.  She does have abnormal findings on CT in
   terms of her gallbladder and though I suspect this may be related to
   resuscitation, we will get a surgical opinion.
   Plan:
   1)       Continue broac-spectrum antibiotics for now
   2)       Wean PEEP/fio2 slowly
   3)       Continue to monitor perfusion endpoints of urine output and
   lactate
 wean vasopressors as tolerated
   4)       Attempt to wean sedation and may slowly increase tidal volumes
   to avoid dyssynchrony maintaining plat pressures < 30
   5)       Surgery input for gallbladder

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with active tobacco use and hypertension. She was admitted with flu-like symptoms and dyspnea, and subsequently intubated for hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure due to septic shock and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS likely secondary to bacterial pneumonia, possibly including influenza.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/65 mmHg to 143/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 81%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 34.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, platelet count of 297 K/uL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 24.5%, and potassium levels ranging from 3.6 mEq/L to 5.1 mEq/L. The urine culture is negative for Legionella, and blood cultures show alpha hemolytic strep.

The patient's current medications include vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, heparin sodium, famotidine, levaquin, metronidazole, Tamiflu, Zosyn, vancomycin, and colace/senna. 

The assessment and plan involve continuing to wean PEEP and FiO2, maintaining sedation as tolerated, minimizing fluid boluses, and monitoring perfusion endpoints. The patient is also being treated for diarrhea, acute renal failure, and pericholecystic fluid. Surgical consultation has been requested for the gallbladder issue.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), and complications related to the gallbladder condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   ARDS due to likely bacterial pneumonia, cannot rule out influenza
   -await speciation of GPC in pairs on sputum culture but suspect alpha
   hemolytic strep or strep pneumoniae
   -continue famiflu while awaiting H1N1 PCR from state lab
   -titrate FiO2 to 40%, decrease RR to 20 and repeat ABG.  Transition to
   pressure support ventilation
   -continue empiric coverage for severe CAP with ceftriaxone, levaquin,
   and vancomycin.  Would dose vancomycin to normal renal
   function-followup blood and sputum cultures
   -may need to transition versed to propofol as patient either agitated
   and dysynchronous or apneic
   Anemia
   -transfuse 1U PRBC
   -check stool guiac
   -check hemolysis labs
   -q6hr CBC
   -some concern for RP bleed given bilateral femoral a-line attempts
   Vasopressor dependent shock
   -levophed being weaned down, still on vasopressin.  Will minimize
   sedation as tolerated
   -repeat CVO2 and lactate
   Acute renal failure now normalized with volume resuscitation
   -dose antibiotics as above
   Pericholecystic fluid
   -continue to trend alkaline phosphatase
   -RUQ ultrasound done with mild CBD dilatation
   -surgery following, does not think cholecystostomy tube indicated at
   this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of active tobacco use and hypertension who presented with flu-like symptoms and diarrhea. She has been intubated for ARDS and is still dependent on ventilatory support. The patient has episodes of agitation and hypoxemia requiring intermittent boluses of fentanyl. Her blood cultures are positive, but the organism has not yet been identified. She is receiving multiple antibiotics empirically for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for ARDS and is still dependent on ventilatory support. Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: Being in the ICU, the patient is at increased risk for acquiring nosocomial infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).
3. Delirium: The patient's sedation is being weaned, and there is a risk of developing delirium in critically ill patients, especially those with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's initial renal function was abnormal but has since normalized with volume resuscitation. However, AKI can still occur due to factors such as sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs, or hypoperfusion.
5. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill, hemodynamically unstable adult with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and organ dysfunction, which were initially attributed to a suspected intra-abdominal source of infection. However, subsequent imaging studies revealed a dilated common bile duct without evidence of obstruction or cholecystitis, but further evaluation is recommended to rule out distal common bile duct stone or pancreatic mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings indicate severe sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not promptly managed. Immediate interventions include administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and supportive care to maintain organ perfusion.

2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's organ dysfunction includes respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorders, and potential renal impairment. Close monitoring and management of these organ dysfunctions are essential to prevent further deterioration.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (SBP in the 70s-80s) suggests persistent hypotension, which increases the risk of inadequate tissue perfusion and organ failure. Vasopressor support may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte panel shows abnormalities, including hyponatremia (Na+: 124 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K+: 5.9 mEq/L"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   .
   # Hypoxia/ARDS:  CXR with multifocal opacities, patient with severe
   hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings.  Clinical story,
   CXR, and oxygenation c/w ARDS.  Concerning precipitating triggers
   include bacterial vs. viral pneumonia.  With Gall bladder distension,
   also considering cholycystitis as ARDS precipitator, although less
   likely. Patient p/w fever, cough, marked leukocytosis with bandemia.
   Oxygenation improving from admission, and able to back down on PEEP and
   FIO2.
   - ween PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Sputum cultures w/ GPCs, will f/u s/s
   - r/o flu, empiric tamiflu rx for now.  Will need to resend flu DFA
   - cont empiric coverage with vanc/CTX/levo, narrow pending culture
   sensitivities
   - will liberalize from ARDSNET, and increase TV and [**Month (only) 453**] RR.  Hopefully
   will allow reduction of sedation as well.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Patient with tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis and
   bandemia.  CXR with multifocal pneumonia, and now health care risk
   factors.
   - cont levo/vanc/CTX
   - send sputum cx
   - cont tamiflu
   - nasal swab repeat
   - will cont empiric flagyl but less for cdiff once stool neg x 1, as no
   colitis on CT, but more for ? of ascending cholangities
   .
   # Hypotension: concern for potential bleed given HCT drop.  Guaic
   negative on exam.  Also concern for RP bleed given having had b/l
   femoral A-line.  Will attempt to lighten sedation.
   -          will check hemolysis labs
   -          transfuse 2 untis of PRBC
   -          check svo2
   -          try to lighten sedation
   .
   # Gallstone:  Distended gallbladder with suggestion of pericholecystic
   fluid and gallbladder stone seen in the region of the neck seen on CT.
   No significant abnormalities of LFTs and no symptoms prior to suggest
   cholysystitis.  U/S with midly dialated CBD.  Gen surgery has seen pt,
   no acute issues.
   -          will stop zosyn.
   -          Cont flagyl for now
   -          Could consider HIDA
   .
   #[**Last Name (un) **]:  Unknown baseline, but Cr at presentation 4.5, now down to 1.0.
   Likely pre-renal hypoperfusion  as improved with improved BP and IVF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, malaise, and was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic. She has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to peanuts and anaphylaxis. She has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Her recent labs show leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count and bandemia. Imaging revealed a dilated common bile duct and gallbladder stone without evidence of obstruction or cholecystitis. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxia, ARDS, sepsis, hypotension, and potential bleeding. There are concerns about the possibility of a gallstone causing ARDS, bacterial versus viral pneumonia, and the need for further evaluation of the common bile duct dilatation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/ARDS: The patient's severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings indicates the need for ongoing monitoring and management of oxygenation. There are concerns about bacterial or viral pneumonia as potential precipitating triggers for ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggest systemic infection. Continued empiric antibiotic coverage is recommended pending culture"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a chief complaint of cough/fever/malaise. The patient presented with hypotension and hypoxia and is now diagnosed with ARDS. The patient also has a history of gallbladder distension and an imaging study suggests a dilated common bile duct. There are concerns about bacterial vs. viral pneumonia as potential precipitating triggers for ARDS. The patient is experiencing fever, cough, marked leukocytosis with bandemia, and the oxygenation is improving from admission.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is already diagnosed with ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs.

2. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggest possible sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

3. Cholecystitis: Although less likely, the gallbladder distension and pericholecystic fluid seen on imaging raise concerns about cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder.

4. Complications related to long-term mechanical ventilation: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and long-term ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),"

   also considering cholycystitis as ARDS precipitator, although less
   likely. Patient p/w fever, cough, marked leukocytosis with bandemia.
   Oxygenation improving from admission, and able to back down on PEEP and

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with complaints of cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic and is now diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with episodes of agitation, tachypnea, desaturation, and hemodynamic instability. She has received various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. The patient's blood cultures show growth of alpha hemolytic strep, indicating a bacterial infection. Her labs indicate leukocytosis with bandemia, elevated lactate levels, and decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. Imaging studies reveal multifocal opacities on chest X-ray and cholelithiasis with mild CBD dilation on abdominal ultrasound. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. She is also receiving Heparin prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/ARDS: The patient's severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings suggests the possibility of ARDS. The presence of multifocal opacities on chest X-ray and clinical symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis. Precipitating factors include bacterial or viral pneumonia, and possibly cholecystitis.

2. Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of sepsis, such as t"

   complaints of cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic,
   now with ARDS.
   24 Hour Events:
   [**12-17**]
   -- cont to wean sedation; in the middle of the night, pt did become
   agitated, biting on tube, tachpyneic, and would desat to 80s with
   turning; small bolus given
   -- levophed continued to wean overnight
   -- family meeting; updated them on situation; husband will be point
   person for updates
   -- 1 set of blood cx from OSH with alpha hemolytic strep; will call in
   AM for speciation
   -- updated PCP as well
   -- US with cholelithiasis and minor CBD dilation; surgery called,
   unlikely will need cholecystostomy tube with these findings, but can
   consider HIDA scan if patient stable
   ------------------------------------------------------
   [**12-18**]
   -- called that bcx with strep pneumo, awaiting sensitivities
   -- hct drop to 20, and was given 2 units of PRBC with appropriate
   bump.  Svo2 on vigileo at 67%, so gave additional unit.  Held off on
   dobutamine as was only with minimal pressor support.
   -- able to ween off pressors overnight completly.  Svo2 at 82% at
   630am.
   -- no evidence of hemolysis, held off on CT to r/o RP bleed as didnt'
   feel woudl change mangemgent, esp with appropriate bump and reduction
   of pressor requirem,ent
   -- Ground covered in reduction of vent settings lost throughout day.
   Patinent hypoxic to high 80s with movements and sunctioning.  FiO2
   upititrate to 70%
   -- Nursing had to increase sedtation as well.  Held off on a propofol
   switch.
   -- Lower blood pressures at 630am.  Gave 5% albumin (serum levels of
   2.0) and LR bolus in hopes of avoiding restarting pressors.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with complaints of cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic and is now diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient experienced several medical complications during her ICU stay. On [**12-17**], she became agitated, biting on the tube, tachypneic, and would desaturate to the 80s with turning. A small bolus was given, and she was weaned off levophed overnight. 

On [**12-18**], the patient's hemoglobin dropped to 20, and she received 2 units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump. The SVO2 on Vigileo was at 67%, so an additional unit was given. The patient was able to wean off pressors overnight completely, with an SVO2 of 82% at 6:30 AM. There was no evidence of hemolysis, so a CT scan to rule out retroperitoneal bleed was not performed. 

The patient's blood pressures were lower at 6:30 AM, so she received 5% albumin (serum levels of 2.0) and LR bolus to avoid restarting pressors. 

The patient has allergies to peanuts and anaphylaxis. She received multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), c"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   # Hypoxia/ARDS:  CXR with multifocal opacities, patient with severe
   hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings.  Clinical story,
   CXR, and oxygenation c/w ARDS.  Concerning precipitating triggers
   include bacterial vs. viral pneumonia.  With Gall bladder distension,
   also considering cholycystitis as ARDS precipitator, although less
   likely.  Increased Fio2 overnight.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Sputum cultures w/ strep pneumo, will f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 46**]
   - r/o flu, empiric tamiflu rx for now.  Clarify whether state lab
   received sputum for H1N1 PCR.
   - cont empiric coverage with CTX/levo, d/c vanc
   - liberalized from ARDSNET, and increase TV and [**Month (only) 453**] RR.  Hopefully will
   allow reduction of sedation as well.
   # Sepsis/Hypotension:  Patient with tachycardia, tachypnea,
   leukocytosis and bandemia.  CXR with multifocal pneumonia, and no
   health care risk factors.  Also concern for RP bleed given having had
   b/l femoral A-line.
   - LR bolus
   - cont levo/CTX
   - cont tamiflu
   - will cont empiric flagyl but less for cdiff once stool neg x 1, as no
   colitis on CT, but more for ? of ascending cholangities
   # Anemia:   neg hemolysis labs.  [**Month (only) 8**] be ACI in setting of infection.
   - trend hct q6-8
   - guaiac stools
   - iron studies
   - would not perform abd/pelvic CT
   # Cholelithiasis:  Distended gallbladder with suggestion of
   pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder stone seen in the region of the
   neck seen on CT.  No significant abnormalities of LFTs and no symptoms
   prior to suggest cholysystitis.  U/S with midly dialated CBD.  Gen
   surgery has seen pt, no acute issues.
   - zosyn stopped
   - Cont flagyl for now. On ceftriaxone.
   - Could consider HIDA

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, malaise, and was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic. The patient now has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a history of sepsis, severe pneumonia, and cholecystitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for this possibility.

2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: Prolonged intravenous catheter use increases the risk of bloodstream infections. The patient has multiple arterial lines and central venous catheters in place.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin are being given.

4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at increased risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic H2 blockers are being administered.

5. Cholangitis: Although the patient has mild dilation of the common bile duct, there is a concern for ascending cholangitis, especially given the presence of pericholec"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a chief complaint of cough, fever, and malaise. She presented with hypotension and hypoxia and was diagnosed with ARDS. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, pneumonia, anemia, cholelithiasis, and electrolyte imbalances. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 119/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has received multiple antibiotic treatments including vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin, and aztreonam due to her reported penicillin allergy. Blood cultures were obtained to identify the causative organism for her symptoms. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.7 K/uL and bands at 1.0%. The patient's renal function has improved from a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL at presentation to 1.0 mg/dL currently.

Imaging studies reveal multifocal opacities on chest X-ray suggestive of pneumonia, as well as distended gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder stone seen on CT. The patient has mild dilation of the common bile duct. Gen surgery has seen the patient and found no acute issues.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding with Vivonex at 30 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained, and the patient is on prophylactic measures including DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and VAP prevention with head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up trials. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function, and potential complications related to the patient's gallbladder stones or cholecystitis."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough/fever/malaise and was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic. She is now diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Hypoxia/ARDS: The patient has severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings, indicating a potential worsening of ARDS or development of further respiratory distress.

2. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient shows signs of sepsis with tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and bandemia. This could lead to septic shock and organ dysfunction.

3. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level (Hct 29.5), which may indicate anemia. It could be due to ongoing bleeding or negative hemolysis.

4. Cholelithiasis: The patient has a distended gallbladder with suggestion of pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder stone seen on CT. This indicates the presence of gallstones, which can lead to complications like cholecystitis if not managed properly.

5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's creatinine level at presentation was 4.5, which is now down to 1.0. This improvement suggests pre-renal hypoperfusion, possibly due to improved"

   2)       Pneumonia, strep plus possible VAP
   3)       Persistent Fever
   4)       Acute renal failure
 improved
   Discussion: Patient remains persistently febrile and was so over the
   weekend with some associated low blood pressures.  At this point, a
   central line infection is possible as is a VAP superimposed on the
   original strep pneumonia.  Thus, we will change the line today.  We
   will also begin to diurese to help get off the ventilator.
   Plan:
   1)       Re-site the central line
   2)       Diuresis
   3)       Continue current vent settings
 if patient becomes
   dysynchronus might try changing from PRVC to set flow and see if this
   helps.  Try not to increase the sedation.
   4)       Continue current antibiotic regimen and get sensitivities from
   OSH for strep

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia. She continues to be febrile and has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, sedation, and mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with anemia and vasopressor-dependent shock, which is now resolved. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 115/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. This is a common complication in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has multiple central lines, which can increase the risk of developing a bloodstream infection. This is particularly concerning since the patient has persistent fevers despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has evidence of renal dysfunction, as indicated by the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. AKI can further complicate the patient's recovery and may require renal replacement therapy.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and multiple interventions increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, and pressure ulcers.
5. Barotrauma: The patient's ARDS and the need for high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on mechanical ventilation increase the risk of barotrauma, which can lead to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.

These are potential medical complications that can arise in the patient's case. It is important to closely monitor the patient and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with septic shock and ARDS secondary to pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia. She has a history of allergies to peanuts, penicillins, and cephalosporins. The patient continues to be febrile and is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, meropenem, Tamiflu, levaquin, vancomycin, Combivent, and famotidine.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (with a normal range of 72-99 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 115/61 mmHg to 162/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 15-33 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg (with a normal range of 8-15 mmHg).

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics but still has persistent fevers. Blood cultures have been negative except for one pending result. Sputum cultures show NGTD and yeast, while blood cultures from previous days are negative.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (23.6 K/uL), decreased hematocrit (29.5%), slightly elevated platelet count ("

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   # Hypoxia/ARDS:  CXR with multifocal opacities, patient with severe
   hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings.  Clinical story,
   CXR, and oxygenation c/w ARDS.  Most likely [**12-28**] Strep Pneumo as grown
   on OSH blood cultures. Influenza negative from State Lab.  Pt initially
   appeared volume overloaded and felt this may be contributing to
   hypoxia; did trial of Lasix yesterday however BP dropped and had large
   volume UOP so discontinued lasix; never started gtt.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated.
   -Have changed sedation to propofol o/n as patient drops BP with
   increasing sedation required for her agitation
   - Blood cultures w/ strep pneumo, pending sensitivity from OSH
   - Continue Levoflox / Vanco / Meropenem.
   - Consider adding metolazone/Lasix if BP improves
   # Fever: As above, and continues to spoke 101.5 overnight. Femoral
   A-line pulled and CVL resited yesterday as possible sources of
   infection. Most likely fever due to known strep bactermia
   - LFTs, amylase/lipase and negative diff for eosinophilia makes drug
   reaction unlikely
   - Consider HIDA if workup unrevealing given borderline CBD dilatation
   # Anemia:   neg hemolysis labs.  [**Month (only) 8**] be ACI in setting of infection.
   - Stable over past few days; continue to trend
   # Cholelithiasis:  Distended gallbladder with suggestion of
   pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder stone seen in the region of the
   neck seen on CT.  No significant abnormalities of LFTs and no symptoms
   prior to suggest cholysystitis.  U/S with midly dialated CBD.  Gen
   surgery has seen pt, no acute issues.
   - cont vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/levoflox
   - Could consider HIDA as above
   # Hypernatremia: Currently improved; may need free water in TF if
   increases again
   #[**Last Name (un) **]:  Unknown baseline, but Cr at presentation 4.5, now down to 1.0.
   Likely pre-renal hypoperfusion as improved with improved BP and IVF.
   # Sedation : Propofol gtt for now
   # High residuals: Start erythromycin 250mg IV, ECG without evidence of
   QT prolongation

","The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with complaints of cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic and is now diagnosed with ARDS. The most likely pathogen grown on OSH blood cultures is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Influenza A/B is negative from the state lab. The patient initially appeared volume overloaded and felt that this may be contributing to hypoxia. A trial of Lasix yesterday, however, resulted in a drop in blood pressure and a large volume output, so the Lasix was discontinued.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 119/63 to 152/82 mmHg, heart rate between 75 and 113 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 14 and 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

The patient has several medical complications including fever, anemia, cholelithiasis, hypernatremia, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The fever is likely due to a known Streptococcus bacteremia. The patient has a history of allergies to peanuts, anaphylaxis, penicillins, and cephalosporins. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics including ceftriaxone, piperacillin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, ery"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU with complaints of cough, fever, and malaise. She presented hypotensive and hypoxic, and was diagnosed with ARDS. Blood cultures revealed growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is pan-sensitive according to OSH sensitivities. The patient's fever is likely due to a known strep bacteremia. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and meropenem. Her sedation has been changed to propofol due to hypotension with increasing sedation requirements. The patient's fluid status is positive, and she is being weaned off PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated. Her labs show anemia, hypernatremia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/ARDS: The patient's severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings indicates a potential complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Continued monitoring and management of oxygenation is necessary.
2. Fever: The patient's persistent fever may be attributed to a known strep bacteremia. Further investigation and management are required to control the infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's stable anemia is likely dilutional in the setting of massive volume overload. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause are necessary.
4. Cholelithiasis: Although the patient's gallbladder appears normal, it should be monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They are intubated and sedated, with a history of fever spikes, respiratory failure, community-acquired strep pneumonia, septic shock, ARDS, acute renal failure (resolved), and persistent fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6 C, pulse rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-152 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 205. The patient has right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 23.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and low albumin level of 2.0 g/dL. Imaging shows worsening in the right upper lobe. Microbiology reveals yeast in the urine culture. The patient is being treated with tube feeds, antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin), diuretics, and other supportive measures. The patient's disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed.

1. Fever: The patient has had a fever of 101.5°F on 2179-12-20 at 11:00 AM. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows worsening in the right upper lobe, suggesting pneumonia. Further evaluation with LENIs should be done, and if negative, a facial CT may be obtained to evaluate for sinusitis. The current antibiotic regimen includes levofloxacin and vancomycin, but meropenem will be discontinued.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is diagnosed with ARDS, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of hypoxemia. Diuresis goals include keeping the central venous pressure (CVP) below 4, and furosemide (Lasix) has been started.

4. Septic Shock: The patient previously had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which has now resolved. Continued monitoring is essential to prevent any further deterioration.

5. Nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, and efforts should be made to improve nutritional intake while managing tube feed residuals.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated,"

   Meropenem. # Fever: As above, and continues to spoke 101.5 overnight.
   Femoral A-line pulled and CVL resited yesterday as possible sources of
   infection. Most likely fever due to known strep bactermia - LFTs,
   amylase/lipase and negative diff for eosinophilia makes drug reaction

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a chief complaint of cough/fever/malaise. The patient presented with hypotension and hypoxia and was found to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The note mentions that the patient most likely has Streptococcus pneumoniae as the causative pathogen for sepsis and ARDS.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 137/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 521 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory support is provided through a CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient has edema in both lower extremities and altered mental status, with sedation from propofol. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 21.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.8 g/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 170 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 27 U/L and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of cough, fever, and malaise. She presented with hypotension and hypoxia and now has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, severe pneumonia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and possible cholelithiasis. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressin, propofol sedation, and multiple antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient has severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings, and her clinical presentation, chest X-ray, and oxygenation indicate ARDS. The most likely cause is Streptococcus Pneumoniae, which has been grown on blood cultures. Pneumonia is a common precipitating factor for ARDS.

2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing fever, hypotension, and hypoxia, which are signs of sepsis. Blood cultures have shown growth of Streptococcus Pneumoniae, and the patient is already on multiple antibiotics. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock.

3. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. This could be due to various factors such as fluid overload, diuretic use, or renal dysfunction. Close monitoring and management of electrolytes and fluid balance are"

   # Hypoxia/ARDS:  CXR with multifocal opacities, patient with severe
   hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings.  Clinical story,
   CXR, and oxygenation c/w ARDS.  Most likely [**12-28**] Strep Pneumo as grown
   on OSH blood cultures. Influenza negative from State Lab.  Pt initially
   appeared volume overloaded and felt this may be contributing to
   hypoxia; did trial of Lasix yesterday however BP dropped and had large
   volume UOP, patient with 15L LOS (+) Fluid status
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Lasix 20mg IV + gtt, goal -200cc / hr
   -Have changed sedation to propofol o/n as patient drops BP with
   increasing sedation required for her agitation
   - Blood cultures w/ strep pneumo, pan sensitive per OSH sensitivities
   - Continue Levoflox / Vanco / Meropenem.
   # Fever: As above, and continues to spoke 101.5 overnight. Femoral
   A-line pulled and CVL resited yesterday as possible sources of
   infection. Most likely fever due to known strep bactermia
   - LFTs, amylase/lipase and negative diff for eosinophilia makes drug
   reaction unlikely
   - Consider HIDA if workup unrevealing given borderline CBD dilatation
   - Vanc / Levo x 14 days
   - Will stop Meropenem, especially given possibility of drug fever
   - LENI to r/o DVT
   # Anemia: Stable, likely dilutional in setting of massive volume
   overload.
   - Improving over past few days; continue to trend
   # Cholelithiasis:  Per Gen surgery has seen pt, no acute issues.
   Monitor however low likelihood of contribution to fevers
   - Could consider HIDA in the future
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved
   #[**Last Name (un) **]:  Unknown baseline, but Cr at presentation 4.5, now down to 1.0.
   Likely pre-renal hypoperfusion as improved with improved BP and IVF.
   # Sedation : Propofol gtt for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU with complaints of cough, fever, and malaise. She presented with hypotension and hypoxia, now diagnosed with ARDS. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/74 mmHg to 140/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 521 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 21.0 K/uL, slightly reduced hemoglobin (Hct) at 27.4%, normal platelet count (Plt) at 378 K/uL, normal blood glucose levels ranging from 117 to 170 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for low albumin at 2.0 g/dL and slightly elevated lactate levels at 1.5 mmol/L"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and a positive culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae. This suggests the presence of pneumonia, which can worsen if not properly treated.

2. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing infection, along with systemic signs of inflammation, indicate the possibility of sepsis. If not managed appropriately, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen levels and increased PaCO2 suggest respiratory distress. ARDS is a serious condition that can occur due to severe lung injury or infection, and it may require advanced respiratory support.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. AKI can occur as a result of sepsis, decreased blood flow to the kidneys, or other underlying causes.

5. Hypotension: The patient requires vasopressin to maintain blood pressure, indicating persistent hypotension. Uncontrolled hypotension can lead to organ perfusion issues and further complications.

6. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition status, as indicated in the progress note, suggests the possibility of malnutrition. Nutritional support is crucial for critically ill patients to promote recovery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic. She now has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is experiencing electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. The patient also has anemia, hypernatremia, and potential sepsis. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications to manage her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining appropriate head-of-bed elevation, performing regular mouth care, and ensuring daily wake-up trials.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be initiated to prevent this complication.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at increased risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic use of H2 blockers should be continued to prevent gastric ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infections: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections. Strict"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of cough, fever, and malaise. She presented with hypotension and hypoxia and is now diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings and multifocal opacities on chest X-ray, which is consistent with ARDS. Strep Pneumonia is suspected as the cause. The patient has been receiving Lasix gtt, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin. She has significant electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. There are also concerns about nutrition, anemia, cholelithiasis, hypernatremia, sedation, high residuals, and possible DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient is at risk for further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory function due to the underlying condition.
2. Infection: Given the presence of fever and positive blood cultures for Streptococcus Pneumoniae, there is a risk of ongoing or worsening infection.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia need to be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status requires attention, and enteral"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and in the ICU. They have a history of allergies to penicillins and cephalosporins, as well as back pain. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 84/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on multiple medications including vasopressin, fentanyl, propofol, and others.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver and kidney function. Imaging and microbiology data are pending.

The patient's medical plan includes tube feeds for alteration in nutrition, vasopressin for septic shock, levofloxacin for pneumonia, diuresis for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), electrolyte and fluid disorder management, and back pain evaluation with an MRI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration in organ function."

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree with the

   Overnight, stopped lasix because of alkalosis; when awoke from sedation
   this morning, she complained of back pain again

   1)       Acute Respiratory Failure secondary to pneumonia/ards and now
   pulmonary edema
   2)       Pneumonia
   3)       Sepsis
   4)       Hypotension: remains on small dose of vasopression which could
   be related to propofol for sedation or lingering poor vascular tone
   from sepsis, or possibly relative adrenal insufficiency
   5)       Back Pain: complains of back pain upon awakening for second
   day in a row.  Family relates complaining of back pain before she was
   admitted as well
   6)       Acute Renal Failure
 resolved
   Plan:
   1)       Re-start lasix and try to diurese to assist in wean
   2)       Continue antibiotics
   3)       Given the persistent back pain, the bacteremia, the prolonged
   febrile phase, and the prolonged poor vasomotor tone, I am concerned
   that there could be an epidural abscess which may have occurred from
   secondary seeding from strep.  Therefore, will obtain MRI of back
   4)       Check cortisol level

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2179-12-23**] 04:12 PM ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is in the ICU with an ongoing infection indicated by fever, positive blood cultures for yeast, and sputum with yeast.
- The patient has been receiving various antibiotics to treat the infection, including meropenem, levofloxacin, erythromycin, and vancomycin.
- The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 84/40 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR: 90 bpm).
- The patient is on vasopressin, indicating ongoing shock.
- The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has back pain and there is a concern for an epidural abscess.
- The patient has acute renal failure but it has resolved.
- The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, fever, and positive blood cultures indicate ongoing sepsis. Prompt management is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status suggests the presence of ARDS. Continued weaning of FiO2 and PEEP, along with diuresis, is important to improve oxygenation and reduce lung injury.
3. Back pain with potential epidural abscess: The persistent back"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   # Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia:  CXR with multifocal opacities, patient with
   severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings.  Clinical
   story, CXR, and oxygenation c/w ARDS.  Most likely [**12-28**] Strep Pneumo as
   grown on OSH blood cultures. Influenza negative from State Lab.  Pt
   initially appeared volume overloaded and felt this may be contributing
   to hypoxia.
   - Diuresis effective, patient today is 10L up from admission (max LOS
   was 19L)
   - pt was diuresed on a lasix gtt with good urine output. Her FiO2 was
   weaned down to 50% which is an improvement from prior
   - Able to wean down FiO2 to 40% , currently attempting SBT with RSBI
   less than 100
   - Attempt extubation today
   - Restart Lasix gtt given very fluid overloaded, will add Diamox given
   alkalosis, target CVP 4
   - Blood cultures w/ strep pneumo, pan sensitive per OSH sensitivities
   - Changed abx to Vanc and Meropenem given persistant secretions
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - RSBI
   #Hypotension- Presumed secondary to infection; but sedation and lasix
   gtt may contribute. Have broadened coverage to Meropenem as above;
   additionally concern for ? epidural abscess given back pain prior to
   presentation which was new
   - Ordered MRI T/L spine
   - Vasporessin prn
   - Goal MAP>60
   # Fever: Afebrile for > 48 hrs. Femoral A-line pulled and CVL resited
   as possible sources of infection. Most likely fever due to known strep
   bactermia, given back pain concerning for epidural abscess
   - LFTs, amylase/lipase and negative diff for eosinophilia makes drug
   reaction unlikely
   - Vanc / Meropenem (Meropenem started [**12-23**])
   - LENI negative
   #Back Pain- Per family pt complained of back pain 5 days prior to
   admission; concern given infection/hypotension
   - MRI as above
   - Pain control with Fentanyl patch
   # Anemia: Stable, likely dilutional in setting of massive volume
   overload.
   - Improving over past few days; continue to trend
   # Cholelithiasis:  Per Gen surgery has seen pt, no acute issues.
   Monitor however low likelihood of contribution to fevers
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved
   #[**Last Name (un) **]:  Unknown baseline, but Cr at presentation 4.5, now down to 0.4.
   Likely pre-renal hypoperfusion as improved with improved BP and IVF.
   # Sedation : Propofol gtt for now
   - will check TG today
   # High residuals: Continue erythromycin 250mg IV, ECG without evidence
   of QT prolongation
   #. Hypocalcemia: Ionized 1.15, most likely due to aggressive diuresis
   - check Vit D and treat if low
   - will replete Ca prn

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU with complaints of cough, fever, and malaise. She presented with hypotension and hypoxia and was diagnosed with ARDS. The patient initially appeared to be volume overloaded and had a high respiratory system compliance (RSBI) value. She was diuresed with Lasix gtt and her FiO2 was weaned down to 40%. The patient's blood cultures showed growth of Strep Pneumonia, which was sensitive to vancomycin and meropenem. The patient's back pain is concerning for a possible epidural abscess. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings indicates a risk for further deterioration in oxygenation.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS and has positive blood cultures for Strep Pneumonia. There is also a concern for an epidural abscess, which may require further investigation and treatment.
3. Fluid overload: The patient initially appeared to be volume overloaded, and careful monitoring of fluid balance is necessary to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema.
4. Hypotension: The patient's presumed secondary hypotension may be due to infection and could contribute to inadequate tissue perfusion.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition meets the criteria for ARDS,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic and is now diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of peanut allergy, anaphylaxis to penicillins, and rash with cephalosporins. She has been experiencing back pain for the past five days prior to admission. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Erythromycin, and Meropenem. Her current medications include Vasopressin, Fentanyl, Lasix, and Propofol. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, hypoxia, and tachycardia. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and increased lactate levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with compensation. Imaging studies reveal multifocal opacities on chest X-ray consistent with ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/ARDS: The patient's severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings indicates a potential complication of ARDS. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory support is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to infection, sedation, or diuretic use. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate vasopressor administration"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including pneumonia, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pain. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/56 mmHg to 171/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals improved bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, with tubes and lines in good position. Microbiology results show the presence of budding yeast in the sputum culture but no growth in the central line culture.

The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl, and nutrition is currently on hold for extubation. The patient is also receiving vasopressin for low dose sedation and diuresis, as well as broadened antibiotic coverage for pneumonia. The plan is to extubate the patient after discontinuing all sedation and following a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration of ARDS. Continuous monitoring and prompt management of these conditions are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation (CPAP/PSV mode) with low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 94%) and elevated PEEP (PEEP: 0 cmH2O). There is also evidence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

2. Strep Pneumonia with probable superimposed Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The sputum culture shows 2+ budding yeast, indicating a possible fungal infection. The patient has been broadening antibiotic coverage overnight, suggesting an ongoing effort to treat pneumonia.

3. Sepsis: The patient is on vasopressin due to sedation and diuresis, indicating septic shock. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality.

4. Severe Back Pain: The patient complains of significant pain every time sedation is lifted, suggesting an underlying issue with the spine. An MRI is planned to rule out an epidural abscess.

5. Potential complications related to prolonged bed rest and immobility, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers, and muscle weakness.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, infection parameters, and pain levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   # Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia:  ARDS on admission (CXR with multifocal
   opacities, patient with severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator
   settings). Now resolving pulmonary edema from aggressive volume
   resuscitation
   - Diuresis effective, patient today is 6L up from admission (max LOS
   was 19L)
   - SBT/RSBI this AM
   - Attempt extubation today
   - Continue Lasix gtt however will likely stop after extubation as she
   is only 3L up from admission, close to her insensible losses
   - stop acetazolamide
   - Blood cultures w/ strep pneumo, pan sensitive per OSH sensitivities
   - Stop  Vanc and Meropenem, change to Levoflox  x 14 day total course
   - Repeat CXR daily
   #Hypotension- Presumed secondary to infection; but sedation and lasix
   gtt may contribute. Have broadened coverage to Meropenem as above;
   additionally concern for ? epidural abscess given back pain prior to
   presentation which was new
   No evidence of abscess on MRI; need to follow up final read
   - Before restarting Vasporessin will stop lasix drip
   -Goal to extubate and d/c sedation
   - Goal MAP>60
   # Fever: Afebrile for 24  hrs. Femoral A-line pulled and CVL resited as
   possible sources of infection. Most likely fever due to known strep
   bactermia, given back pain concerning for epidural abscess
   - LFTs, amylase/lipase and negative diff for eosinophilia makes drug
   reaction unlikely
   - Complete course with levoflox
   - LENI negative
   - Prelim MRI neg
   #Back Pain- Per family pt complained of back pain 5 days prior to
   admission; concern given infection/hypotension
   - MRI as above
   - Pain control with Fentanyl patch
   # Anemia: Stable, likely dilutional in setting of massive volume
   overload.
   - Improving over past few days; continue to trend
   # Cholelithiasis:  Per Gen surgery has seen pt, no acute issues.
   Monitor however low likelihood of contribution to fevers
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   # High residuals: Continue erythromycin 250mg IV, ECG without evidence
   of QT prolongation
   #. Hypocalcemia: Ionized 1.15, most likely due to aggressive diuresis
   - check Vit D and treat if low
   - will replete Ca prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU with complaints of cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic and diagnosed with ARDS. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and sedation. Her condition has been complicated by back pain, which may be related to an epidural abscess. She also has pneumonia and sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance have been managed, and she is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and malaise suggest a respiratory infection. The presence of multifocal opacities on chest X-ray confirms the diagnosis of pneumonia.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings indicates the development of ARDS. This is supported by the findings on chest X-ray and the need for aggressive volume resuscitation.
3. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggest sepsis, which has led to organ dysfunction.
4. Epidural abscess: The patient's back pain prior to presentation raises concern for an epidural abscess, especially given the presence of fever and hypotension.
5. Cholelithiasis: Although not currently an acute issue, the patient has a history of chole"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   # Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia:  CXR with multifocal opacities, patient with
   severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings.  Clinical
   story, CXR, and oxygenation c/w ARDS.  Most likely [**12-28**] Strep Pneumo as
   grown on OSH blood cultures. Influenza negative from State Lab.  Pt
   initially appeared volume overloaded and felt this may be contributing
   to hypoxia.
   - Diuresis effective, patient today is 6L up from admission (max LOS
   was 19L)
   - SBT/RSBI this AM
   - Attempt extubation today
   - Continue diamox/Lasix gtt
   - Blood cultures w/ strep pneumo, pan sensitive per OSH sensitivities
   - Changed abx to Vanc and Meropenem given persistant secretions
   slightly elevated this AM
   - Repeat CXR daily
   #Hypotension- Presumed secondary to infection; but sedation and lasix
   gtt may contribute. Have broadened coverage to Meropenem as above;
   additionally concern for ? epidural abscess given back pain prior to
   presentation which was new
   No evidence of abscess on MRI; need to follow up final read
   - Vasporessin prn
   -Goal to extubate and d/c sedation
   - Goal MAP>60
   # Fever: Afebrile for > 72 hrs. Femoral A-line pulled and CVL resited
   as possible sources of infection. Most likely fever due to known strep
   bactermia, given back pain concerning for epidural abscess
   - LFTs, amylase/lipase and negative diff for eosinophilia makes drug
   reaction unlikely
   - Vanc / Meropenem (Meropenem started [**12-23**])
   - LENI negative
   - Prelim MRI neg
   #Back Pain- Per family pt complained of back pain 5 days prior to
   admission; concern given infection/hypotension
   - MRI as above
   - Pain control with Fentanyl patch
   # Anemia: Stable, likely dilutional in setting of massive volume
   overload.
   - Improving over past few days; continue to trend
   # Cholelithiasis:  Per Gen surgery has seen pt, no acute issues.
   Monitor however low likelihood of contribution to fevers
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   # High residuals: Continue erythromycin 250mg IV, ECG without evidence
   of QT prolongation
   #. Hypocalcemia: Ionized 1.15, most likely due to aggressive diuresis
   - check Vit D and treat if low
   - will replete Ca prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic and diagnosed with ARDS. The patient had multifocal opacities on chest X-ray and severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings. Strep pneumo was grown on OSH blood cultures, and influenza was negative. The patient initially appeared volume overloaded, but diuresis was effective. She is currently on Vanc and Meropenem due to persistent secretions and concern for an epidural abscess given her back pain prior to presentation. There is no evidence of abscess on MRI, and the goal is to extubate and discontinue sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia: The patient has severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings, which indicates a high risk for further respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypotension: The patient has presumed secondary hypotension due to infection, sedation, and Lasix gtt. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Fever: The patient has been afebrile for more than 72 hours, and femoral A-line was pulled and CVL resited as possible sources of infection. The most likely cause of fever is known strep bacteremia,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several potential medical complications that can arise. These complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential sepsis if not properly managed.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is suspected to have ARDS, a life-threatening condition that affects the lungs and impairs their ability to provide sufficient oxygen to the body.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels are being closely monitored and managed due to imbalances. This can affect various bodily functions and may require interventions such as diuretics or electrolyte supplementation.

4. Fever: The patient has recurrent low-grade fever, which could be indicative of an ongoing infection or drug fever. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

5. Back pain: The patient is experiencing back pain, which could be related to musculoskeletal issues or potentially more serious conditions like an epidural abscess. Further evaluation through imaging, such as an MRI, is planned.

6. Potential for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular weight heparin, are being implemented to"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   # Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia:  ARDS on admission (CXR with multifocal
   opacities, patient with severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator
   settings). Now resolving pulmonary edema from aggressive volume
   resuscitation
   - Diuresis effective, paieitn close to euvolemic at this time (max LOS
   was 19L)
   - Continue Lasix gtt however will likely stop after extubation as she
   is only 3L up from admission, close to her insensible losses
   - Blood cultures w/ strep pneumo, pan sensitive per OSH sensitivities
   - Stop  Vanc and Meropenem, change to Levoflox  x 14 day total course
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - aggressive chest PT / nebs / mucomyst
   #Hypotension- Presumed secondary to infection; but sedation and lasix
   gtt may contribute. Have broadened coverage to Meropenem as above;
   additionally concern for ? epidural abscess given back pain prior to
   presentation which was new
   No evidence of abscess on MRI; need to follow up final read
   - Before restarting Vasporessin will stop lasix drip
   -Goal to extubate and d/c sedation
   - Goal MAP>60
   # Fever: Afebrile for 24  hrs. Femoral A-line pulled and CVL resited as
   possible sources of infection. Most likely fever due to known strep
   bactermia, given back pain concerning for epidural abscess
   - LFTs, amylase/lipase and negative diff for eosinophilia makes drug
   reaction unlikely
   - Complete course with levoflox
   - LENI negative
   - Prelim MRI neg
   #Back Pain- Per family pt complained of back pain 5 days prior to
   admission; concern given infection/hypotension
   - MRI as above
   - Pain control with Fentanyl patch / Lidocaine patch
   # Anemia: Stable, likely dilutional in setting of massive volume
   overload.
   - Improving over past few days; continue to trend
   # Cholelithiasis:  Per Gen surgery has seen pt, no acute issues.
   Monitor however low likelihood of contribution to fevers
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   # High residuals: Continue erythromycin 250mg IV, ECG without evidence
   of QT prolongation
   #. Hypocalcemia: Ionized 1.15, most likely due to aggressive diuresis
   - check Vit D and treat if low
   - will replete Ca prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic and was diagnosed with ARDS. The patient's condition has been improving, with resolving pulmonary edema from aggressive volume resuscitation. She is close to euvolemic, and diuresis is effective. Blood cultures were taken with strep pneumo coverage. The patient is being treated with Lasix, Levofloxacin, and other medications. Repeat CXR is ordered daily, and aggressive chest PT/nebs/mucomyst are being given. The patient's fever has resolved, and there is concern for an epidural abscess given her back pain prior to presentation. An MRI was performed, and most likely fever due to known strep bacteremia is expected. The patient's anemia is stable and likely dilutional in the setting of massive volume overload. Cholelithiasis is not an acute issue, and hypernatremia has resolved. High residuals are being treated with erythromycin. Ionized calcium levels are within normal range, and vitamin D and calcium repletion will be done as needed. The patient's code status is DNR, and her disposition is undetermined.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with cough, fever, and malaise, indicating an infection. Despite aggressive chest PT/nebs/mucomyst"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. The note mentions that the patient required invasive ventilation and was extubated early in the day. The patient also has increasing secretions and is receiving aggressive chest physiotherapy (PT) and nebulizer treatments (nebs). 

The patient's allergies include peanuts, which can cause anaphylaxis, and penicillins and cephalosporins, which can cause rashes. The last doses of antibiotics given were Vancomycin, Meropenem, Levofloxacin, and Erythromycin.

The patient is receiving various infusions, including Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, and Morphine Sulfate for pain management. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/55 to 133/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 982 mL and output of 167 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 5,968 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 440 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 year old female who presented with complaints of
   cough/fever/malaise, found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, now with
   ARDS.
   # Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia:  ARDS on admission (CXR with multifocal
   opacities, patient with severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator
   settings). Now resolving pulmonary edema from aggressive volume
   resuscitation
   - Diuresis effective, patient close to euvolemic at this time (max LOS
   was 19L)
   - Continue Lasix gtt however will likely stop after extubation as she
   is only 3L up from admission, close to her insensible losses
   - Blood cultures w/ strep pneumo, pan sensitive per OSH sensitivities
   - Stop  Vanc and Meropenem, change to Levoflox  x (day [**10-8**]) day total
   course
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - aggressive chest PT / nebs / mucomyst
   #Hypotension- Resolved.
   # Fever: Low grade temp overnight,. Femoral A-line pulled and CVL
   resited as possible sources of infection. Most likely fever due to
   known strep bactermia, given back pain concerning for epidural abscess
   - LFTs, amylase/lipase and negative diff for eosinophilia makes drug
   reaction unlikely
   - Complete course with levoflox
   - LENI negative
   - MRI neg
   - check UA
   #Back Pain- No evidence of epidural abscess / bone process.  Some DJD
   at L5/S1
   - MRI as above
   - Pain control with Fentanyl patch / Lidocaine patch
   # Anemia: Stable, likely dilutional in setting of massive volume
   overload.
   - Improving over past few days; continue to trend
   # Cholelithiasis:  Per Gen surgery has seen pt, no acute issues.
   Monitor however low likelihood of contribution to fevers
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   # High residuals: PO nutrition now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic and was diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and other interventions.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/55 to 133/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is extubated and showing signs of improvement in mental status.

Allergies include peanuts, penicillins, and cephalosporins, for which she has received appropriate medication adjustments. The patient has been on various medications including heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood cultures have been taken, and the patient is on a course of antibiotics. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray, have been performed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with pneumonia, and ARDS may have developed secondary to severe infection.
2. ARDS: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by respiratory failure."

   I saw and examined the patient with the pulmonary fellow, assessment
   and plan discussed in detail.  I would emphasize the following.
   Secretions continue to be an issue post-extubation requiring aggressive
   chest PT and pulmonary toilet.  Able to wean Fi02 to 3 L NC.
   Defervesced, ? drug fever. Patient is also autodiuresing. Adequate air
   movement bilaterally, occasional rhonchi.  Generalized weakness on
   exam.
   PT to consult.
   Agree with keeping patient in the ICU given tenuous respiratory
   status.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They are experiencing multiple medical complications, including severe sepsis, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), electrolyte and fluid disorders, and gastrointestinal issues. The patient's pain needs to be controlled, and there are concerns about their nutrition, glycemic control, and sleep. The patient's central line needs to be discontinued, and another peripheral line should be placed. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which has since resolved. However, they still require aggressive chest physiotherapy and pulmonary toilet due to secretions post-extubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is on day 10 of levofloxacin for pneumonia. There is yeast present in the sputum, indicating a possible fungal infection.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, and aggressive chest PT is being continued. The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and they need to remain in the ICU.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient is autodiuresing and requires ongoing electrolyte repletion.
5. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient needs to have dulcolax and miralax added to their regimen for bowel movement facilitation.
6. Sleep Disturbances: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, and now has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/44 to 129/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation and is expected to be extubated soon. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low calcium level. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins and cephalosporins. She is currently receiving IV fluids, Lasix gtt, and antibiotics (levofloxacin). The patient's back pain is concerning for an epidural abscess, but imaging studies did not show any evidence of infection or bone process. The patient has resolved hypoxia, shock, and hypernatremia. She is now close to euvolemic and will likely stop Lasix gtt after extubation. The patient's nutrition is being advanced to PO, and her glycemic control is being monitored. She has multiple lines, including a central venous line and peripheral arterial line."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with cough, fever, and malaise. She was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic, and was diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been improving, with resolving pulmonary edema from aggressive volume resuscitation. She is close to euvolemic, and diuresis is effective. The patient's blood cultures showed growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and she was treated with Levofloxacin. The patient's fever resolved after changing antibiotics. Her back pain is concerning for epidural abscess, but imaging did not show any evidence of an abscess or bone process. The patient's anemia is likely dilutional due to massive volume overload. She also has cholelithiasis, hypernatremia, high residuals, and hypocalcemia, which have all resolved. The patient is now ready for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/ARDS/Pneumonia: The patient initially had severe hypoxia refractory to initial ventilator settings. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of ARDS and pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, which resolved. However, there is still a risk of hypotension due to septic shock.
3. Fever: The patient had low-grade fever overnight, and there is a possibility"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no significant changes in medical, social, or family history. They were admitted to the ICU due to multi-lumen central venous catheter (CVC) removal and associated complications, including hypoxia, fever, and possible anaphylaxis to antibiotics.

Overnight, the patient experienced hypoxia that responded to diuresis and chest physiotherapy. Their blood pressure was borderline at around 80-90s and recovered after stopping the lasix drip. The patient had a brief temperature of 100.5, and subsequent checks showed them to be afebrile. Blood cultures were drawn, and the CVC tip was sent for culture.

The patient has several allergies, including peanuts, anaphylaxis to penicillins, and rashes with cephalosporins. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 12/25/2179 at 08:13 AM, meropenem on 12/25/2179 at 10:04 AM, levofloxacin on 12/26/2179 at 12:00 PM, and erythromycin on 12/27/2179 at 12:37 AM.
