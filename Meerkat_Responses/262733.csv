","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old man who was found down with altered mental status, elevated lactate and leukocytosis, hypertension, tremor, and intubated for airway protection.
- The patient has been diagnosed with an altered mental status, seizure, and potential non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient's lactic acidosis has resolved with intubation and propofol, and he is on prophylactic antibiotics due to the potential risk of infection.
- The patient's leukocytosis is being monitored, with a CBC differential pending to determine if it is due to infection or acute stress reaction from the seizure.
- The patient's elevated troponins suggest a possible NSTEMI, for which he is being started on a statin and beta-blocker, and aspirin has been held.
- The patient's condition is being closely monitored with various tests and treatments ongoing.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications due to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection, particularly pneumonia, due to prolonged immobility and ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or further myocardial damage.
4. Neurological complications including seizures or worsening of the altered mental status.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who was found down with altered mental status, elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, hypertension, and tremor. He was intubated for airway protection and diagnosed with an altered mental status, possibly due to myoclonic seizures. The patient has elevated troponins and cardiac enzymes, indicating a potential NSTEMI. Other potential medical complications include septic shock, bacterial infection, lactic acidosis, and acute stress reaction. The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, antivirals, statins, beta-blockers, and prophylactic medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient has shown signs of tremulous movements and elevated lactate levels, suggesting possible myoclonic seizures. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
2. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's elevated troponins and cardiac enzymes indicate a possible NSTEMI. Continued monitoring of cardiac enzymes and consultation with cardiology are recommended.
3. Septic Shock: The patient's lactic acidosis and hypertension initially raised concerns for septic shock. However, the resolution of lactic acidosis with intubation and propofol administration makes it less likely.
4. Bacterial Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated white count raise the possibility of a bacterial infection. Cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.

","The patient is an 80-year-old man who was found down and is currently in the ICU. He has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has altered mental status and a history of seizure without status epilepticus. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 112/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and is not assessed for skin or neurologic examination.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. His blood glucose level is 146 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is slightly elevated at 0.14 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status, seizure, lactic acidosis (improved), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and respiratory failure. The plan is to wean sedation and extubate the patient, with the need for c-spine clearance post-extubation. The remainder of the issues will be managed by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient may develop pneumonia.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   This is a  72 y.o. man found down, with elevated lactate and
   leukocytosis, hypertension, tremor, and intubated for airway
   protection.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely seizure, possible acute infarct,
   meningitis, encephalitis.  Pt had elevated lactate and white count.
   Lactate is now resolved making seizure process likely.
   -fosphenytoin 100mg IV TID
   - d/c antibiotics for bacterial coverage given LP results.  continue
   acyclovir
   - Head MRI without contrast given ARF - order written
   -EEG ordered
   -telemetry
   -blood, urine, sputum Cx
   -neuro recs from [**10-29**], will see him today
   #Agitation:  After extubation was persistently agitated, with episodes
   of combativeness, aggression.  Appeared to be alert, but very angry and
   frustrated.  Haldol given, 2.5 mg with very good effect - much more
   calm without excessive sedation.
   #Foley trauma:  During period of agitation soon after extubation the
   patient stood up and in the process pulled on his Foley, causing pain
   and hematuria.  The catheter was flushed multiple times without
   clearing, obstruction felt during attempt.  Finally the catheter was
   removed, with moderate-sized clot adhering to and completely
   obstructing the tip.  Both the nurse and resident attempted to place
   3-way catheter, then urology also attempted without success.
   -moderate bleeding from meatus after Foley removal, but stopped.
   -no obstruction, urinating well.
   # Elevated troponins - With elevated CK, CKMB and troponins.  CKMB -I
   Negative.  Likely had an NSTEMI on the scene of the acident.  Troponins
   trended, yesterday afternoon trending down.
   - Statin, BB
   - held ASA given coffee ground in suction,  will trend Hct and
   reasses.  Hct reduced slightly today but stable.
   - Cardiology aware
   #Lactic acidosis: in setting of hypertension makes septic shock
   unlikely. Has resolved with intubation and propofol. [**Month (only) 51**] potentially be
   from myoclonic activity given setting of tremulous movements.  Empiric
   antibiotics now stopped, leukocytosis resolved, afebrile, no clear
   source.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man who was found down with elevated lactate and leukocytosis. He had hypertension, tremor, and was intubated for airway protection. The patient is now extubated and stable. He experienced episodes of agitation and combativeness after extubation but was calm with the administration of Haldol. The patient had a Foley catheter trauma, causing pain and hematuria. The catheter was removed due to obstruction, and there was moderate bleeding from the urethral meatus. The patient's troponins were elevated, indicating a possible NSTEMI. His lactic acidosis has resolved, and leukocytosis is now normal. The patient's condition is being managed with appropriate medications, and further tests and evaluations are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to a seizure, possible acute infarct, meningitis, or encephalitis. It is important to rule out these possibilities and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Agitation: The patient's agitation may require further evaluation and management. The use of Haldol has been effective in reducing agitation.
3. Foley trauma: The Foley catheter trauma resulted in pain and hematuria. It is important to monitor the patient's urinary system for any complications related to catheter removal and ensure proper healing.
4. Cardiac issues: The elevated troponins suggest"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   This is a  72 y.o. man found down, with elevated lactate and
   leukocytosis, hypertension, tremor, and intubated for airway
   protection.  Agitated yesterday, but today completely calm, pleasant,
   reports feeling his usual self.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely seizure given very high lactate,
   immediate resolution, no infectious signs.  Etiology for possible
   seizure unclear.
   -fosphenytoin 100mg IV TID
   - d/c antibiotics for bacterial coverage given LP results.  Will also
   stop acyclovir today.
   - Would like to get head MRI to further evaluate
 patient says today
   that he absolutely cannot tolerate a closed MRI.  Would consider
   possible open MRI as outpatient?
   -EEG ordered
 will discuss with neurology about management
   potentially get EEG, how to arrange outpatient workup vs further
   inpatient testing.
   -telemetry
   #Agitation:  After extubation was persistently agitated, with episodes
   of combativeness, aggression.  Appeared to be alert, but very angry and
   frustrated.  Haldol given, 2.5 mg with very good effect - much more
   calm without excessive sedation.  This morning completely calm,
   pleasant.  Remembers yesterday
s events, but apologized for behavior.
   #Foley trauma:  During period of agitation soon after extubation the
   patient stood up and in the process pulled on his Foley, causing pain
   and hematuria.  The catheter was flushed multiple times without
   clearing, obstruction felt during attempt.  Finally the catheter was
   removed, with moderate-sized clot adhering to and completely
   obstructing the tip.  Both the nurse and resident attempted to place
   3-way catheter, then urology also attempted without success.
   -moderate bleeding from meatus after Foley removal, but stopped now,
   urine clear.
   -no obstruction, urinating well.  Able to use urinal this morning, no
   incontinence.
   # Elevated troponins - With elevated CK, CKMB and troponins.  CKMB -I
   Negative.  Troponins trended, yesterday afternoon trending down.
   - Statin, BB
   -Hct reduced slightly today but stable - 40.
   #Lactic acidosis:. As above
 likely from seizure or seizure-like
   activity.  Empiric antibiotics now stopped, leukocytosis resolved,
   afebrile, no clear source.
   - f//u urine, blood, sputum cx.
   # Leukocytosis: Now resolved.  Likely acute stress reaction from
   possible seizure.  Could also be c/w infection, but no other indicators
   for infection.
   - cbc WNL today
   - acyclovir, add abx as cultures return
   - LP clear

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old man found down with elevated lactate and leukocytosis, hypertension, tremor, and intubated for airway protection.
- The patient was extubated without complications and initially showed mild agitation and frustration but later became combative and abusive to staff.
- During a period of agitation, the patient pulled out his Foley catheter, causing pain and hematuria.
- The Foley catheter was removed due to obstruction, resulting in moderate bleeding from the urethral meatus.
- The patient's troponins are elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.
- The patient's lactic acidosis is likely due to seizure-like activity.
- Leukocytosis has resolved, and there are no signs of infection.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, and he is on a regular diet.
- The patient's agitation was successfully managed with Haldol.
- The patient's condition has improved, and he is calm and pleasant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's initial altered mental status could be a result of seizure activity.
2. Foley trauma: The patient experienced trauma from pulling out his Foley catheter, leading to pain, hematuria, and potential urinary tract injury.
3. Cardiac injury: Elevated troponins suggest possible cardiac injury, which should be further evaluated.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   This is a  80 y.o. man found down, with elevated lactate and
   leukocytosis, hypertension, tremor, and intubated for airway
   protection.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely seizure, possible acute infarct,
   meningitis, encephalitis.  Pt had elevated lactate and white count.
   Lactate is now resolved making seizure process likely.
   -fosphenytoin 100mg IV TID
   - d/c antibiotics for bacterial coverage given LP results.  continue
   acyclovir
   - Head MRI without contrast given ARF - order written
   -EEG ordered
   -telemetry
   -blood, urine, sputum Cx
   -neuro recs from [**10-29**], will see him today
   #Agitation:  After extubation was persistently agitated, with episodes
   of combativeness, aggression.  Appeared to be alert, but very angry and
   frustrated.  Haldol given, 2.5 mg with very good effect - much more
   calm without excessive sedation.
   #Foley trauma:  During period of agitation soon after extubation the
   patient stood up and in the process pulled on his Foley, causing pain
   and hematuria.  The catheter was flushed multiple times without
   clearing, obstruction felt during attempt.  Finally the catheter was
   removed, with moderate-sized clot adhering to and completely
   obstructing the tip.  Both the nurse and resident attempted to place
   3-way catheter, then urology also attempted without success.
   -moderate bleeding from meatus after Foley removal, but stopped.
   -no obstruction, urinating well.
   # Elevated troponins - With elevated CK, CKMB and troponins.  CKMB -I
   Negative.  Likely had an NSTEMI on the scene of the acident.  Troponins
   trended, yesterday afternoon trending down.
   - Statin, BB
   - held ASA given coffee ground in suction,  will trend Hct and
   reasses.  Hct reduced slightly today but stable.
   - Cardiology aware
   #Lactic acidosis: in setting of hypertension makes septic shock
   unlikely. Has resolved with intubation and propofol. [**Month (only) 51**] potentially be
   from myoclonic activity given setting of tremulous movements.  Empiric
   antibiotics now stopped, leukocytosis resolved, afebrile, no clear
   source.
   - f//u urine, blood, sputum cx.
   - continue acylovir for now.
   # Leukocytosis: Now resolved.  Likely acute stress reaction from
   possible seizure.  Could also be c/w infection, but no other indicators
   for infection.
   -trend cbc
   - acyclovir, add abx as cultures return
   - LP clear

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old man found unconscious with elevated lactate and leukocytosis, hypertension, tremor, and intubated for airway protection. He was extubated without complications but became agitated and combative, pulling out IV and Foley catheter, resulting in bleeding. The Foley catheter was removed due to obstruction, and moderate bleeding occurred but stopped. The patient's troponins are elevated, suggesting a possible NSTEMI. Lactic acidosis has resolved, and leukocytosis is now normal. The patient is on antibiotics, antiviral medication, and antiepileptic drugs. Further investigations include an MRI, EEG, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient had an altered mental status and elevated lactate, which could indicate a seizure. He was given fosphenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
2. Foley trauma: The patient pulled out the Foley catheter, causing pain and hematuria. There was also an obstruction felt during attempts to flush the catheter, and it was eventually removed due to a clot.
3. Possible NSTEMI: The elevated troponins suggest myocardial injury, possibly due to an NSTEMI. The patient is being managed with statins and beta-blockers.
4. Lactic acidosis: Although resolved, the initial presentation of elevated lactate may have been caused by a seizure"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man with several medical conditions. He was found unconscious and intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. The patient's mental status has improved since then, and he has been extubated.

The patient experienced a seizure and delirium, which have since resolved. He also had episodes of agitation and aggression, attempting to remove his invasive lines and causing self-harm. The patient was combative and abusive towards the staff.

The patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and possible NSTEMI (Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction), as indicated by elevated troponin levels that are now trending down. He also has altered mental status, possibly due to the seizure or another cause.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 74-102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109-176 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. His temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and creatinine levels. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, and his electrolytes are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by increased serum creatinine levels. His liver function tests are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV mode on"
