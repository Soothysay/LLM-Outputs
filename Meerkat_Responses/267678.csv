","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension. She was admitted with epigastric and chest pain, along with evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic diastolic heart failure (EF > 55%), acute renal failure (ARF), diabetes type II, and a history of abdominal pain related to H. pylori infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of new pneumonia in the left lower lobe (LLL). It is important to continue current antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for bacterial coverage.
2. Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient has worsened pleural effusions, indicating worsening of chronic diastolic heart failure. Another attempt to administer Lasix 20 IV x1 will be made, and hydralazine 10mg PO will be added to help with diastolic failure.
3. ARF: The patient's fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is less than 1%, suggesting prerenal azotemia. A renal ultrasound has been ordered, and a fluid challenge of 500ml will be given to assess the kidneys' response.
4. Diabetes II: The patient's blood sugar levels are reasonably controlled, but there is an increased risk of complications. Blood glucose monitoring should continue.
5. Chest Pain:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of respiratory distress, chest pain, and evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of stability and worsening. She requires supplemental oxygen and is currently on CPAP support. Her blood pressure remains elevated, and she has shown signs of renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, Bacterial NOS: The patient has evidence of new pneumonia since her last admission, which is likely contributing to her symptoms.
2. Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient appears euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic, suggesting possible congestive heart failure.
3. CKD-stage 3: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.3, but it has increased to 1.7, indicating acute renal failure.
4. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain is likely related to the interval pneumonia.
5. Abdominal pain, epigastric: The patient may have gastritis or other gastrointestinal pathology.
6. CAD, s/p bypass graft: The patient has a history of CAD and previous bypass surgery.
7. Hypertension, benign: The patient has elevated blood pressure despite being on antihypertensive medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and previous right nephrectomy. She presents with epigastric and chest pain and has evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/44 mmHg to 185/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is receiving morphine for respiratory distress and has been placed on non-rebreather oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 323 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 127 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.02 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), chronic anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), coronary artery disease (CAD), gastritis, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

The plan includes continuing current antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime), maximizing blood pressure control, increasing hydrochlorothiazide to 20 mg orally every 8 hours to help with diastolic failure, encouraging oral intake to improve renal function, increasing insulin sensitivity, providing pain relief for chest pain, continuing proton pump inhibitor and Maalox for potential gastritis, ruling out acute myocardial infarction, continuing antiplatelet and antihypertensive medications, and confirming do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, progression of acute renal failure, development of further infections, exacerbation of coronary artery disease, and complications related to gastritis or other gastrointestinal pathology.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). She presents with epigastric and chest pain, as well as evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/44 mmHg to 185/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is receiving morphine for respiratory distress and has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has evidence of new pneumonia since last admission, likely contributing to her symptoms.
   - Continue current antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime).
2. Chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), ejection fraction (EF) > 55%: The patient has worsened pleural effusions on chest X-ray.
   - Maximize blood pressure control.
   - Increase hydralazine to 20 mg orally every 8 hours to help with diastolic failure.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment.
   - Renal ultrasound did not show obstruction.
   - Encourage oral intake, as it is improving with oral"

   Assessment/Plan: The patient is an 88 year old female with history of
   CAD, hypertension who presents with epigastric and chest pain with
   evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   #. Pneumonia, Bacterial NOS: Patient with evidence of new pneumonia
   since last admission in LLL. Given new finding, likely accounts for
   symptoms with possible contribution of diaphragmatic irritation
   accounting for epigastric discomfort although presentation in total is
   not classic for pneumonia.  not septic in appearance,
   - continue current abx vanco/cefepime day #[**3-22**]
   #. Chronic Diastolic CHF, EF > 55%: Pt has worsened pleural effusions
   on cxr.
   -Will maximize BP control.
   - incr hydral to 20mg po q8h to help w/ diastolic failure
   #. ARF
 FeNa <1%.
   - Renal u/s did not show obstruction
   - encourage PO intake, cr improving with oral intake
   #. Diabetes II controlled with complication: Blood sugar with
   reasonable control on admission
   - increased pt
s ISS
   #. Chest Pain: Patient has a known history of CAD however reports her
   current discomfort is different in quality, likely related to interval
   pneumonia as above. ECG without dynamic changes, first set CE negative
   -  continue SL nitro prn pain
   #. Abdominal pain, epigastric: As above, may be related to interval
   pneumonia although gastritis or other GI pathology possible, patient
   with known history of H. Pylori. Abdominal exam otherwise generally
   benign.
   - continue PPI, Maalox PRN for potential gastritis
   - guaiac stools
   #. CAD, s/p bypass graft: ECG without dynamic change, ruling out as
   above
   - complete ROMI
   - continue Aspirin, PLavix, Statin, Metoprolol
   #. Hypertension, benign: Patient with elevated BP with SBP near 220 in
   ED, improved after having received her home medications
   - continue outpatient regimen of Clonidine patch, Nifedipine,
   Metoprolol
   #. Chronic UTIs - continue Nitrofurantoin per outpatient regimen
   #. GERD: Continue Pantoprazole
   #. FEN - low Na, Cardiac diet
   #. Ppx - SQ Heparin, PPI
   #. Code - DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient on admission
   - After discussion with pt
s family on [**2-22**] family confirmed that they
   wanted to continue abx, but allow pt to have morphine for SOB.
   #. Dispo - Pending clinical improvement

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and chronic anemia. She presents with epigastric and chest pain and has evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient also has acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, and ischemic heart disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of new pneumonia since the last admission, which may contribute to her symptoms and could potentially worsen if not properly treated.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the presence of pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. If not managed appropriately, it could lead to further respiratory compromise.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, indicated by the elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's history of CAD and ischemic heart disease increases her risk for cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status is crucial to identify any potential complications.

5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's epigastric discomfort may be related to gastritis or other gastrointestinal pathology. Proper management of her gastrointestinal symptoms is essential to prevent complications such as bleeding or perforation.

6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD"
