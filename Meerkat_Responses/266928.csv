","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He was admitted with line sepsis, now treated by removing the tunneled HD catheter. The patient remains hemodynamically stable but has altered mental status, which could be due to infection, sedating medications, and a possible history of seizure. There is also a concern for gangrene in the left hand, and cultures are being monitored. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and ESRD on HD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had line sepsis, and although the tunneled HD catheter has been removed, there is still a risk of ongoing infection. Monitoring vital signs for evidence of sepsis physiology and following cultures will be important.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be multifactorial, involving factors such as infection, sedating medications, and a potential history of seizure. Treating underlying infection, holding sedating medications, monitoring on telemetry, and obtaining records regarding the seizure workup will be essential.
3. Gangrene: The presence of dry gangrene in the left hand raises concern for potential progression and the need for vascular surgery recommendations. Obtaining plain films of the hand and considering vascular surgery referrals"

   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 768**]
s note above
   and agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would add the
   following:
   Mr [**Known lastname 1406**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 1407**] cultures are positive, not surprisingly and vanc
   levels are being checked today, and ceftaz being stopped.  His left
   subclaian line will be d/c
d as it may well have become seeded.
   Echocardiogram will be ordered.
   We will work with renal to decide on HD access.  Right now paient has
   asterixis and creat = 8.2, so I suspect we will not be able to wait
   that much longer.  Fortunately he is not acidotic or fluid overloaded.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) admitted to the ICU with line sepsis. The tunneled hemodialysis catheter was removed due to pus and blood cultures are growing Staphylococcus aureus. The patient remains hemodynamically stable but has altered mental status, which is multifactorial in nature. Other potential sources of fever include gangrene in the left hand. The plan includes continuing vancomycin with hemodialysis, monitoring vital signs for evidence of sepsis physiology, removing the subclavian catheter, obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for vegetations, holding all sedating medications, treating the underlying infection, and monitoring on telemetry.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of line sepsis and the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in the blood cultures indicate a high risk of sepsis. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs and implement appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to multiple factors including infection, sedating medications, and possibly a history of seizures. It is crucial to hold all sedating medications, treat the underlying infection, and obtain records regarding the seizure workup.

3. Gangrene in Left Hand"

   Assessment and Plan
   54y/o M with PMH of ESRD on HD and PVD admitted with line sepsis, now
   s/p removal of tunneled HD catheter.
   # Line Sepsis: Tunneled line was removed [**9-6**] and had frank pus.
   Blood Cx from [**Hospital 1373**] hospital growing staph aureus, awaiting
   sensitivities.  Initial blood cx here growing GPC clusters, likely
   staph, concern for MRSA given pt on HD. He remains hemodynamically
   stable.  Other source of fever could potentially be gangrene in left
   hand although per vascular does not appear infected.
   - continue to follow cultures here and at [**Hospital 1373**] hospital
   - continue vancomycin with HD
   - as vanc trough was low, given extra 1g dose of vancomycin x 1 today,
   will follow levels
   - monitor VS for evidence of sepsis physiology, still febrile but BP
   stable
   - on 24 hour line holiday (subclavian was placed prior to removal of
   tunneled HD line)
   - check TTE for vegetations, ordered but not yet done
   # Altered mental status:
   Most likely multifactorial in setting of infection, sedating
   medications, and ? h/o seizure (which has been worked up at [**Hospital3 373**]
   Hospital in the past). MS improved today, fully oriented, was only
   oriented to place before
   - Hold all sedating meds
   - Treat underlying infection as above, seems to have improved as
   infection being treated
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Obtain [**Hospital3 373**] records re: seizure workup
   - may also develop symptoms of uremia as dialysis is deferred
   # PVD/CAD:
   - continue plavix
   - F/U read plain films of hand; appreciate vascular surgery recs
   - Transplant surgery following
   # ESRD on HD
   - appreciate renal recs, will assess need for HD today
   - continue renal meds (Sevelamer, nephrocaps)
   # IDDM
   - SSI, continue Lantus, FSG qid, DM diet
   # FEN:
   - replete electrolytes
   - DM diet
   # Prophylaxis:
   - Subcutaneous heparin, OOB, omeprazole, prn bowel regimen
   # Access: 18g PIV, 24 hour line holiday ,will need temp line placed for
   HD if renal assesses need for HD today

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He was admitted with line sepsis and had his tunneled HD catheter removed due to pus coming out of it. The blood cultures are growing staphylococcus aureus, likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) given his HD status. He remains hemodynamically stable, but other potential sources of fever include gangrene in his left hand, although the vascular surgeon does not see any signs of infection. The patient's mental status has improved, but he is still somewhat somnolent. He is currently on vancomycin, and his trough levels are being monitored. His vital signs are stable, and he is not experiencing pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, or chills. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line Sepsis: The patient had line sepsis and his tunneled HD catheter was removed due to pus coming out of it. Blood cultures are growing staphylococcus aureus, which could indicate MRSA. The patient is currently on vancomycin, but the infection needs to be closely monitored.
2. Gangrene in Left Hand: Although the vascular surgeon does not see any signs of infection, there is concern for gangrene in the patient's left hand. This could"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure ranging from 128/79mmHg to 155/96mmHg, heart rate between 68-99 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's mental status has improved and they are oriented to place.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives. Blood cultures have been obtained from both central and peripheral lines, and fever is present. The patient's renal function is being monitored, and they have a history of MRSA infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis-related complications: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not appropriately managed.
2. MRSA infection: The patient's previous MRSA infection indicates a risk of recurrence or spread of infection.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
4. Line-related complications: The patient's lines, including central and peripheral lines, need to be monitored for potential complications such as infection or thrombosis.
5. Osteomyelitis: The radiographic concern for osteomyelitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently hemodynamically stable. He has shown improvement in mental status and orientation. 

The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, and his antimicrobial treatment has been adjusted accordingly. The patient also has an abnormality in his left hand fourth digit, which raises concerns for osteomyelitis. 

The patient's altered mental status is believed to be related to sepsis and medications. His renal function is being monitored, and there is no current indication for acute dialysis. 

The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis: The abnormality in the patient's left hand fourth digit may indicate osteomyelitis, which is a potential complication that needs to be further evaluated.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the possibility of renal failure. This is indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP, especially since he is receiving mechanical ventilation. Proper elevation of the head of bed and appropriate antibiotic therapy can help"
