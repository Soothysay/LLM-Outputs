   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p resuscitation with return to
   sinus tachycardia, now intubated, with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure: Primarily hypoxemic.  Shunt versus volume
   overload.  Improvement with nitric suggests some shunt physiology,
   although intracardiac shunt not evident on TEE.  Pt continues to
   improve, with decreasing Fi02 and NO now off. Compliance improving.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal PEEP for today is 15
   per pulm recs.
   - continuing lasix gtt, aim net negative I/O 500-1L , start by
   increasing lasix gtt, pt tolerated increased diuresis well with
   improved oxygenation.
   - ARDS net protocol
   - nebs
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes with diuresis
   - wean sedation, off midazolam
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone.
   - Cont. amiodatrone PO 400mg tid
   - Attempt to d/c levophed to improve ectopy, tolerate MAP >60.
   - Consider trail of BB for HR control
   - may need EP study and possible ablation in future.
   # Hypotension: Initially secondary to VT, now probably contribution
   from sedatives, positive pressure ventilation especially in the setting
   of marked RV dysfunction.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be intravscularly volume depleted,
   but total body overloaded.  Sepsis less likely at this point, given
   broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, negative culture data, although
   stil febrile.
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - Attempt to add BB as tolerated, low dose IV lopressor Q4 hours,
   2.5-5mg
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis/fever/right lobe infiltrate- likely aspiration
   PNA, witnessed emesis during intubation. Continued to be febrile
   overnight and this morning. Vanco level was low, dose increased.
   Cultures negative thus far.  Fem line removed and sent for culture.  ?
   drug fever given persistant fever and no pos. cx data.
   - Cultures from peripheral and from line pending
   - fem line out, new CVL placed [**3-10**].
   - MRSA screen positive, on precautions
   - Continue vanco and zosyn, day 6, plan for 8-day course for VAP to
   complete on [**2151-3-13**]
   - Cont. vanc, dosed by levels given renal function improving
   - blood cultures NGTD, urine small growth GPC, sputum is oral flora.
   Continue to monitor.
   - Tylenol 2g daily standing for fever
   # Chronic Systolic - Congestive Heart Failure: Has right and left sided
   heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair.
   - hold lisinopril, digoxin
   - TEE and TTE
 showed poor systolic function, EF not estimated
   - continue diurese w lasix drip to goal -500 cc / 24 hours
   # ARF: ATN, creatinine has plateaued and now improving, 2.4 today.
   - monitor UOP
   - renally dose vancomycin, pip-Tazo
   - no NSAIDs for now
   # Bowel motility/nutrition
 Monitor for improvement after lightening
   fentanyl and
   - Bowel regimen, increase as tolerated (holding off reglan/erythromycin
   for concern for ectopy/ QT prolongation), if needed can try low dose
   reglan.
   - On trophic tube feeds, f/u nutrition recs
   -? PO naloxone
   - standing lactulose TID
   # Transaminitis: Multifactorial from shock liver, CHF and amiodarone.
   Improving
   - monitor LFTs given amio restarted
   - got vitamin K yesterday
   - check amylase and lipase
   # Family dynamics: family initially concerned about care of pt in the
   hospital, social work involved.
   - social work consult
   - Children
s congenital specialist [**Name (NI) 1850**], appreciate input
   - Cont. frequent updates
   #Gout: holding allopurinol and colchicine
   FEN:  agressively replete lytes
   ACCESS:  Fem line d/c
d yesterday, new IJ placed [**3-10**].  Fever curve
   decreasing, will monitor femoral blood cultures.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and ASD repair. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was resuscitated, after which he developed hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure with improvement seen while on nitric oxide. Shunt versus volume overload is suspected, but intracardiac shunt is not evident on TEE. The patient continues to improve with decreasing FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated. Goal PEEP for today is 15 per pulm recs.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: This is likely due to scarring from the patient's Ebstein's anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy with Amiodarone is continued. Attempt to d/c levophed to improve ectopy, tolerate MAP >60. Consider trial of beta-blocker for HR control and possible EP study and ablation in the future.
3. Hypotension: Initially secondary to VT, now probably contribution from sedatives, positive pressure ventilation especially in the setting of marked RV dysfunction. The patient may also be intravascularly volume depleted, but with total body overload. Sepsis is less likely at this point, given broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, negative culture data,"

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and repair of an atrial septal defect. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was successfully resuscitated. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

His current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown improvement with decreasing FiO2 and NO, indicating some shunt physiology. The goal is to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, aiming for a PaO2 >60 unless high fevers are present. Preferentially reduce FiO2 over PEEP this morning.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: This is likely a result of scarring from previous cardiac surgeries. Amiodarone has been started for suppression of ectopy, and consideration will be given to a trial of beta-blockers for heart rate control. An electrophysiological study and possible ablation may be necessary in the future.
3. Hypotension: Initially secondary to VT, now probably due to sedatives and positive pressure ventilation, especially with marked right ventricular dysfunction. The patient is also intravascularly volume depleted but has total body overload. Sepsis is less likely at this point, given broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and negative culture data.

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 1391**].
   Critical Care 60 minutes for hemodynamic instability and respiratory

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was successfully resuscitated. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been improving, with decreasing FiO2 and discontinuation of nitric oxide. His compliance is improving, and weaning of FiO2 and PEEP is being continued as tolerated. The goal PaO2 is set at >60 unless high fevers are present. Preferential reduction of FiO2 over PEEP is planned this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily hypoxemic in nature, with a possible shunt physiology. However, intracardiac shunt has not been evident on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). There are plans to continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP, aiming for a goal PaO2 of >60 unless high fevers are present. Regular monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs) will be done.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient had an episode of ventricular tachycardia, which is likely a result of scarring from his Ebstein's anomaly repair. Amiodarone has been started"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and ASD repair. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia, hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and persistent fevers. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events:
- Ventilatory support weaning: FIO2 decreased to 45% and PEEP decreased to 10%, but the patient became more hypoxemic, so FIO2 was increased back to 50%.
- Fever: Tmax 103.6, blood cultures drawn, fever curve downtrending.
- TSH and cortisol level tests ordered.
- Sodium level 154, indicating a free water deficit of approximately 6-7 L, leading to free water flushes and D5W administration.
- Lasix and antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) stopped.
- Metoprolol dosage increased to 50 mg and lisinopril 2.5 mg started.
- CT scan of sinuses showed new sinusitis, possibly fungal.
- ID: Antibiotics discontinued due to possibility of drug-related fever.
- Pulmonary: BAL considered if fever persists or new spike occurs.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Vancomycin on [**2151-3-13**] at 09:00 AM and Zosyn on [**2151-3-14**] at 08:00 AM.
- Infusions: Fentanyl at 80 mcg/hour.
- Other ICU medications: Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started on [**2151-3-14**] at 08:00 AM.
- Other medications: Flowsheet data as of [**2151-3-15**] 06:14 AM.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: Primarily hypoxemic. Continue to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated. Goal PaO2 >60. Continue pressure support. Nebulizations recommended. Discussion about extubation within 14 days versus the need for tracheostomy.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from Ebstein's anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy with Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol. Cont. Amiodarone PO 400 mg tid. Titrate up beta-blockers for HR control. Increase to 25 mg at [**Hospital1**] today. Likely will need EP study and possible ablation in the future.
3. Hypotension: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation. Added back on beta-blockers. MAP goal >65. Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated. Add on low-dose ACE inhibitor.
4. Fevers: Leukocyt"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and ASD repair. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and is currently intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers.
- He has been weaned off ventilatory support, but his oxygenation has worsened, so the FIO2 was increased back to 50%.
- The patient's sodium level is elevated (154), and there is a free water deficit of approximately 6-7 liters. Free water flushes and D5W have been started to address this.
- Antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) were stopped due to the possibility of drug-related fever. A CT scan of the sinuses showed new sinusitis, possibly fungal in nature.
- The patient's blood pressure is now elevated while weaning sedation, so metoprolol has been restarted.
- The patient's condition is being monitored closely, with plans for further diagnostic tests and interventions as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure, primarily hypoxemic, needs to be closely monitored. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP will continue as tolerated, with the goal of maintaining PaO2 above 60.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's ventricular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and is currently intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, and several potential causes have been considered, including occult infection, gout, drug fever, thyroid storm, and adrenal insufficiency.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to improve with decreasing FiO2 and NO now off. Compliance is improving, but he remains hypoxemic, so the goal is to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated with a target PaO2 of >60. Pressure support will be continued, and the possibility of extubation within 14 days or the need for tracheostomy will be determined based on further evaluation.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: This is likely a result of scarring from the patient's Ebstein anomaly and previous repairs. Amiodarone has been used to suppress ectopy, and Metoprolol has been initiated for heart rate control. The long-term plan includes an electrophysiology study and possible ablation, as well as the consideration of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated while weaning sedation. The goal is to maintain a"

   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia,  now intubated, with hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory Failure: Primarily hypoxemic.  Pt continues to improve,
   with decreasing Fi02 and NO now off. Compliance improving.  Attempted
   to wean FiO2 down to 45% from 50% but still hypoxemic so back to 50%.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support

   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - Cont. amiodarone PO 400mg tid
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abz with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenan insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.
    Continued to spike fevers, but fever curve seems to be decreasing.
   Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling blanket.  Fem line removed
   and sent for culture with no growth.  Possible drug fever given
   persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C. diff negative. CT with PO
   contrast did not show clear source of fevers. CT sinus did have partial
   opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL placed [**3-10**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and is now presenting with unstable ventricular tachycardia. He was intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been in the ICU since admission. The patient continues to have persistent fevers, and various potential sources have been investigated without conclusive evidence of infection. Other issues include hypernatremia, chronic systolic heart failure, acute renal failure (ATN), gout, and transaminitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a significant concern. He initially presented with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and although he has shown improvement, he remains dependent on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, aiming for a PaO2 of >60. However, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the weaning process is not successful.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced unstable ventricular tachycardia likely due to scarring from his Ebstein's anomaly repair. Amiodarone has been used for suppression of ectopy, and metoprolol has been titrated for heart rate control. The patient may require an electrophysiological study and possible ablation in the future, along with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and repair of atrial septal defect (ASD).
- He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been weaned off ventilatory support, with FIO2 down to 45% but became more hypoxemic, so it was increased back to 50%.
- He continues to have fever, and blood cultures have been obtained.
- The patient's sodium level is high, and he has a significant free water deficit. Lasix has been stopped, and D5W has been started to correct the sodium imbalance.
- His blood pressure is currently controlled without the need for pressors, but he is on metoprolol and lisinopril.
- The patient's condition is improving, with decreasing FiO2 and NO now off. Compliance is improving as well.
- The plan is to continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, aiming for a PaO2 of >60. Pressure support will also be continued.
- A head of bed elevation has been recommended to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Further pulmonary recommendations include obtaining a final read chest CT and considering bronchoscopy if indicated.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Plan for bronchoscopy and hope for extubation later today.  Have
   reviewed work-up to date for unexplained fever. Patient is acutely ill
   but does not appear toxic. Drug fever still a likely possibility given
   negative work-up.  Will hold antibiotics.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   critical care for ventilator management/respiratory failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of Ebstein's anomaly and previous tricuspid valve reconstruction. He was admitted for unstable ventricular tachycardia and is currently intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient continues to have persistent fevers, and various potential causes have been considered and ruled out. These include aspiration pneumonia, occult infection, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency, and exposure to culprit medications. The patient's recent tests have shown no evidence of ongoing infection or other systemic issues.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, ventricular tachycardia, hypertension, hypernatremia, chronic systolic heart failure, acute renal failure, and possible gout. The patient's recent lab results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes. Imaging studies have revealed partial opacifications of the bilateral mastoids on a CT sinus, but no clear source of fevers has been identified.

The patient's treatment plan includes weaning off ventilatory support, extubation with the assistance of anesthesia, bronchoscopy, and further evaluation for unexplained fever. The patient's sodium levels are being carefully monitored and repleted due to hypernatremia. Diuretics have been held, and the patient is receiving D5W to address fluid imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of heart disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever of unknown origin, ventricular tachycardia, and ineffective coping. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 129/76 mmHg to 133/76 mmHg, heart rate between 63-92 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 12-23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 93%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450-692 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer levels. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 174, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34-37 mmHg. The patient has a history of heart disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), and myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and D5W. The patient's overall condition appears to be unstable with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia increases the risk of arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is indicated by low oxygen saturation, high PaCO2 levels, and the need for mechanical ventilation. This condition can progress to respiratory failure and death if not managed appropriately.
3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever suggests an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). If not identified and treated, the infection may worsen and lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's history of heart disease and current symptoms may indicate CHF. If left untreated, CHF can lead to pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and death.
5. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's unstable condition and multiple organ involvement (e.g., respiratory, renal, cardiovascular), MODS is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia,  now intubated, with hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory Failure: Mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia.  Pt continues
   to wean slowly, became hypercarbic and hypoxemic during SBT yesterday
   at 0/8, however patient was unable to stay upright and also ETT likely
   too small which is making wean more difficult.  Pulm following and
   recommend extubation today with anesthesia at bedside given was
   difficult intubation.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support
   - Extubation this afternoon with pulm and anesthesia at bedside
   - Consider bronch prior to extubation.
   - cont. nebs
   - If fails extubation will discuss trach. F/u pulm recs.
   - raise head of bed
   - f/u am CXR for tube position.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - amiodarone decreased to 200mg tid [**3-15**] given received 10gm loading
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abx with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.  All culture data negative thus far.  Now with increasing
   secretions.
    Continued to spike fevers.  Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling
   blanket.  Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.
   Possible drug fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C.
   diff negative. CT with PO contrast did not show clear source of fevers.
   CT sinus did have partial opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL
   placed [**3-10**].
   - d/c abx per ID.
   - ID following, appreciate their recs
   - Check mycolytic blood cultures, pending
   - blood cultures NGTD, urine small growth GPC, sputum is oral flora.
   Continue to monitor.
   - Repeat sputum given inc. secretions
   - Tylenol 650 qid standing for fever, standing ASA 325 PO qid
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test normal
   - follow LFTs, CK, TSH normal
   # Hypernatremia -  likely in setting of diuresis. Free water deficit
   initially 8L, improving with inc. free water flushes and D5.
   -hold lasix gtt
   -D5W continuous + free water flushes for repletion
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Chronic Systolic heart failure - Congestive Heart Failure: Has right
   and left sided heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD
   repair.
   - hold digoxin
   - TEE and TTE
 showed poor systolic function. Done just after arrest.
   Repeat yesterday showed improved systolic function with EF 50%
   - hold diuresis
   - appreciate Children

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and is currently experiencing unstable ventricular tachycardia. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient also has persistent fevers.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/76 mmHg to 133/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced with high sodium levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing weaning from mechanical ventilation, consideration for extubation with anesthesia at the bedside, and monitoring for bronchospasm prior to extubation. The patient is on amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia and metoprolol for heart rate control. The patient's blood pressure is being managed with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors. The patient's fevers are attributed to various possible causes such as occult infection, drug fever, thyroid storm, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to di"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, ineffective coping, ventricular tachycardia, a history of heart disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever of unknown origin, and hypothermia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown desaturation episodes during weaning attempts. There have been efforts to switch from controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) to assist-control mode (AC) and then to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's temperature has been spiking, with a maximum recorded at 102.7°F. There have been attempts to culture blood samples but are expected to be low-yield. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 50%, and their sodium level remains high at 153 mEq/L. Fluid balance and respiratory support data are provided. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, platelets, creatinine, and lactate levels. They also have elevated D-dimer and lactic acid levels. The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status, ineffective coping, ventricular tachycardia, a history of heart disease, ARDS, fever of unknown origin, and hypothermia. The patient is being provided with nutrition, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and is currently intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has persistent fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes occult infection, gout, thermoregulatory dysfunction, drug fever, thyroid storm, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient has been aggressively repleting electrolytes and is being monitored for any signs of improvement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to struggle with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Close monitoring and weaning of FiO2 and PEEP are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's history of Ebstein's anomaly and previous cardiac surgeries increases the risk of recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Continuous monitoring and suppression with amiodarone are recommended.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. Titration of beta-blockers and close monitoring of blood pressure are required.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to diuresis. Repletion with D5W is necessary to correct the sodium imbalance.
5. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has right and left-sided"

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Doing well post extubation. Also now afebrile. Continue management for
   chronic hypoventilation syndrome. Will review with EP for continuation
   of amiodarone given young age and baseline pulmonary disease.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 25 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. The patient presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been extubated without complication. The patient has persistent fevers, now trending down, and persistent hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and was previously intubated. Although he has been extubated, there may still be a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to ongoing hypercarbia and obesity.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient had unstable ventricular tachycardia, likely as a result of scarring from his Ebstein's anomaly repair. He is currently on metoprolol and amiodarone. The long-term management plan includes an electrophysiology study and possible ablation, as well as the consideration of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently elevated, and he is on antihypertensive medication. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate adjustment of medication may be necessary.
4. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers since admission, which have been attributed to various causes including occult infection, gout,"

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia,  now intubated, with hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers.
   # Respiratory Failure now s/p extubation: Mixed hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia.  Pt continues to wean slowly, became hypercarbic and
   hypoxemic during SBT yesterday at 0/8, however patient was unable to
   stay upright and also ETT likely too small which is making wean more
   difficult.  Pulm following and recommend extubation today with
   anesthesia at bedside given was difficult intubation.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support
   - Extubation this afternoon with pulm and anesthesia at bedside
   - Consider bronch prior to extubation.

   - If fails extubation will discuss trach. F/u pulm recs.
   - raise head of bed
   - f/u am CXR for tube position.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - amiodarone decreased to 200mg tid [**3-15**] given received 10gm loading
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abx with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.  All culture data negative thus far.  Now with increasing
   secretions.
    Continued to spike fevers.  Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling
   blanket.  Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.
   Possible drug fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C.
   diff negative. CT with PO contrast did not show clear source of fevers.
   CT sinus did have partial opacifications of bilaterally mastoids. CVL
   placed [**3-10**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. The patient presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and is now intubated with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent fevers, and other complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to struggle with weaning from mechanical ventilation and has mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if extubation fails.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia is likely due to scarring from previous cardiac surgeries. There is a possibility of recurrent arrhythmias, and an electrophysiological study with possible ablation and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement may be necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient has elevated blood pressure, and there is a risk of uncontrolled hypertension leading to complications such as cardiac remodeling or end-organ damage.
4. Fevers: Despite completing a course of antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers, which could indicate an occult infection or drug fever. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of the fever.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to diuresis. There is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure, and ventricular tachycardia. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, now trending down, and persistent hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to struggle with weaning from mechanical ventilation. He experienced mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday, which indicates ongoing respiratory difficulties. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory function and adjust ventilator settings accordingly.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, likely related to scarring from his Ebstein's anomaly repair. Suppressed ectopy is being managed with amiodarone, and metoprolol has been added for heart rate control. Further evaluation with an electrophysiology (EP) study and possible ablation may be necessary in the future. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) might also be required.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently elevated, and he has been placed back on beta-blockers. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and is now extubated after a prolonged intubation for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has persistent fevers, now trending down, and persistent hypernatremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia, likely a component of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) contributing to ongoing hypercarbia. The plan is to use CPAP at night, raise the head of the bed to relieve pressure from the abdomen, wean O2 as tolerated to maintain SpO2 >92%, and follow up with an am chest X-ray.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: This is likely a result of scarring from the patient's Ebstein's anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy with Amiodarone was given, and now the patient is on Metoprolol. The plan is to decrease Amiodarone to 200mg tid given received 10gm loading dose on [**3-15**] and continue Lisinopril 2.5mg PO daily. An electrophysiological (EP) study and possible ablation in the future may be required, along with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The timing of the EP study will be discussed with the EP team.

3. Blood Pressure: The patient was off pressors but now has elevated blood pressure while weaning sedation. A beta-blocker (BB) has been added back on, aiming for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal >65. PEEP and sedative should be weaned as tolerated. A low-dose ACE inhibitor has also been added.

4. Fevers: The patient has had fevers ranging from 103-104 degrees since admission. Initially considered to be due to aspiration pneumonia, but with no sputum production and improving pulmonary function, other possible causes such as occult infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout, thermoregulatory dysfunction after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, or adrenal insufficiency are being considered. The femoral line has been removed and sent for culture with no growth. A central venous line (CVL) was placed on [**3-10**]. The fever curve is now resolving after extubation.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent hypernatremia likely in the setting of diuresis and insensible losses in the setting of persistent fevers. A free water"

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ PMhx of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, now extubated s/p a prolonged
   intubation for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, persistent
   fevers now trending down and persistent hypernatremia.
   # Respiratory Failure now s/p extubation: Mixed hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia.  Pt continues to wean slowly, became hypercarbic and
   hypoxemic during SBT yesterday at 0/8, however patient was unable to
   stay upright and also ETT likely too small which is making wean more
   difficult.  Pulm following and recommend extubation today with
   anesthesia at bedside given was difficult intubation.
   - Cont to wean Fi02 and PEEP as tolerated.  Goal Pa02>60
   - Cont. pressure support
   - Extubation this afternoon with pulm and anesthesia at bedside
   - Consider bronch prior to extubation.

   - f/u am CXR for tube position.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of scarring from ebstein
   anomaly/repairs. Suppressed ectopy w Amiodarone. Now on Metoprolol.
   - amiodarone decreased to 200mg tid [**3-15**] given received 10gm loading
   - titrate up BB for HR control, increased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
    -added Lisionpril 2.5mg PO daily
   - likely will need EP study and possible ablation in future.  Will
   likely need ICD.
   # BP: Off pressors, now elevated BP while weaning sedation.  Added back
   on BB.
   - MAP goal >65,
   -  Wean PEEP and sedative as tolerated.
   - added on low dose ACEI
   # Fevers: Fevers to 103-104 since admission, initially considered to be
   due to aspiration PNA.  However has completed course of abx with no
   sputum production and improving pulmonary function.  Chest CT did not
   show evidence for ongoing infection. Ddx at this point includes occult
   infection (abscess, acalculous cholecystitis, sinusitis), gout,
   thermoregulatory dysfunciton after cardiac arrest/non-exposure heat
   stroke, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency (although less
   likely now that not hypotensive). Not exposed to any culprit meds for
   NMS.  All culture data negative thus far.  Now with increasing
   secretions.
    Continued to spike fevers.  Still on ATC tylenol, aspirin and cooling
   blanket.  Fem line removed and sent for culture with no growth.
   Possible drug fever given persistent fever with no pos. cx data. C.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has since been extubated and is now on noninvasive ventilation. 

The patient's recent events include the removal of an invasive arterial line, central venous line, and nasogastric tube. He has been experiencing fevers ranging from 103-104 degrees Fahrenheit, initially attributed to aspiration pneumonia but now considered to be due to other causes such as occult infection, gout, drug fever, thyroid storm, adrenal insufficiency, or thermoregulatory dysfunction after cardiac arrest. 

The patient has persistent hypernatremia, likely resulting from diuresis, and is receiving free water flushes and D5W to replete fluids. His blood pressure is elevated while weaning sedation, and he is on beta-blockers for blood pressure control. 

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires pressure support and nebulizers. The plan is to continue weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated and to extubate the patient later today with pulmonologist and anesthesia at the bedside. 

The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, which is believed to be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and repair for right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient continues to be weaned slowly from mechanical ventilation but experienced hypercarbia and hypoxemia during a spontaneous breathing trial yesterday. The healthcare team recommends extubation today with anesthesia at bedside given the difficult intubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still struggling with mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Extubation may pose risks if the patient is not fully prepared.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia is likely a result of scarring from previous surgeries. Suppressed ectopy with Amiodarone has been implemented, and the patient is now on Metoprolol. However, further evaluation through an electrophysiology study and possible ablation may be required, along with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated while weaning sedation. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >65.
4. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers since admission, initially attributed to"

   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Cardiac status stable 1 day post extubation. Will need EP study at some

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Epstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and repair of atrial septal defect (ASD). The patient presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was resuscitated before being intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia, which is likely a result of the natural progression of Epstein's anomaly. Amiodarone has been started at a dose of 200 mg twice daily, and an electrophysiology (EP) study is planned.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation due to congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and restrictive ventilation caused by obesity. The patient was successfully extubated on [**2151-3-16**] without difficulty.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a combination of arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, and positive pressure ventilation. Initially, the patient was on three pressors, which were later weaned off but still requires intermittent use.

4. Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has right and left-sided heart failure secondary to tricuspid valve reconstruction and ASD repair. Low-dose metoprolol and lisinopril"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and repair of atrial septal defect. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia, was resuscitated, and now has hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and being mechanically ventilated. He also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure, gout, and is holding allopurinol and colchicine due to renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's recent episode of ventricular tachycardia, likely due to the natural progression of Ebstein's anomaly, may recur or worsen without proper management.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved for now, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the underlying causes such as congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and restrictive ventilation due to obesity are not adequately addressed.
3. Hypotension: The combination of arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, and positive pressure ventilation can lead to persistent hypotension. Pressor support may be required intermittently.
4. Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's pre-existing heart failure can worsen due to the stress on the heart from the recent episode of ventricular tachycardia and mechanical ventilation.
5. Gout:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was intubated. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure (now resolved), ventricular tachycardia, hypotension (low blood pressures), fever (now resolved), hypernatremia (now resolved), chronic systolic heart failure, acute renal failure, transaminitis, gout, and nutrition issues. The patient is planned for an EP study today with ventricular fibrillation ablation as well as ICD placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia but now has resolved respiratory failure. However, the patient still requires nighttime CPAP due to OSA.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient likely has ventricular tachycardia resulting from scarring caused by his Ebstein's anomaly/repairs. He has been loaded with amiodarone and will continue outpatient metoprolol. The plan is for an EP study today with ICD placement.

3. Hypotension: The patient is without a history of hypertension but presented with low blood pressures. He is on beta-blockers and Lisinopril. His beta-blocker dose needs to be lowered, and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia, underwent intubation and extubation, and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple ongoing issues including respiratory failure (resolved), ventricular tachycardia, hypertension, fever (resolved), hypernatremia (resolved), chronic systolic heart failure, acute renal failure, transaminitis, gout, and nutrition concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had initial mixed hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Although the respiratory failure has been resolved, it is important to continue nighttime CPAP to prevent its recurrence.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia is likely a result of scarring from Ebstein's anomaly/repairs. The plan for an electrophysiology (EP) study with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement should be followed through.
3. Hypertension: The patient is on beta-blockers and lisinopril, but experienced low blood pressures. Lowering the beta-blocker dose and uptitration of ACE inhibitor as tolerated is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, post tricuspid valve reconstruction, and systolic congestive heart failure. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was resuscitated. The patient is currently intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation since admission.

Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient likely experienced ventricular tachycardia as a result of the natural history of Ebstein's anomaly. He was given amiodarone at a dose of 200 BID, and an electrophysiology (EP) study is planned.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, which was multifactorial in origin. This included congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and restrictive ventilation due to his habitus. The patient required mechanical ventilation from admission and was successfully extubated on [**2151-3-16**] without difficulty.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension was caused by a combination of arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, and positive pressure ventilation. Initially, the patient required three pressors, which were weaned off. However, the patient still requires intermittent use of pressors.

4. Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has right and left-sided"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of congenital heart disease, non-compliance with medical recommendations, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure in the 110s/60s, heart rate in the 70s, temperature within normal range, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on CPAP. The patient is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and elevated cardiac markers. The patient has impaired aerobic capacity, balance, knowledge, muscle performance, respiration/gas exchange, and transfers. He also presents with altered mental status, ineffective coping, ventricular tachycardia, and fever of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially result in hemodynamic instability or sudden cardiac arrest if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, which can progress to severe lung injury and respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, previously underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction, and has right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. The patient presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia, received resuscitation, and was intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: This condition is likely a result of the natural history of Ebstein's anomaly. The patient is already on amiodarone at a dose of 200 BID, and an electrophysiology study may be planned. It is recommended to continue amiodarone and start a low-dose beta-blocker.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation due to congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and restrictive ventilation caused by habitus. The patient was extubated successfully on [**2151-3-16**] without difficulty.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension as a combination of arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, and positive pressure ventilation. Initially, the patient was on three pressors, which were weaned off but still requires intermittent use.

4. Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has right and left-sided heart failure, previously underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction, and atr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, post tricuspid valve reconstruction, and right and left-sided systolic congestive heart failure. The patient presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was successfully resuscitated. He was intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure has since resolved, but he continues to require intermittent pressors for hypotension. He also has a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure with right and left-sided heart failure, which was previously treated with tricuspid valve reconstruction and ASD repair. The patient is currently on low-dose metoprolol and lisinopril. He also has a diagnosis of gout, for which allopurinol and colchicine are being held due to renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's recent episode of unstable ventricular tachycardia suggests a potential for recurrent arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring and management of cardiac enzymes are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence due to underlying conditions such as congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be attributed to a combination"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Continues to do well. Goal for today is transfer to telemetry floor and
   schedule timing for ICD that needs to be performed prior to discharge.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 20 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a medical history of Ebstein's anomaly, who underwent tricuspid valve reconstruction and ASD repair. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was successfully resuscitated. The patient required mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has since resolved. He also experienced hypotension, likely secondary to the arrhythmia and cardiogenic shock, and required the use of three pressors. The patient has chronic systolic congestive heart failure with right and left-sided heart failure. He is currently euvolemic and goals include maintaining lisinopril and beta-blocker at low doses. Other issues include gout, which is being held due to renal failure, and the need for a speech and swallow evaluation after extubation. The patient has a right femoral line in place for access. Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's history of Ebstein's anomaly increases the risk of arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. It is important to continue amiodarone therapy and monitor cardiac enzymes.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if the patient develops another"

   Assessment and Plan
   39M w/ pmh of ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction,
   right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with
   unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p resuscitation with return to
   sinus tachycardia, now intubated, with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of natural history of ebstein
   anomaly.  Amiodarone now at 200BID, EP study at some point.
   -continue amiodarone, low-dose beta-blocker
   -trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: Now resolved.  Multifactorial secondary to CHF,
   OSA, and restrictive ventilation due to habitus.  Required mechanical
   ventilation from admission (intubated during V Fib arrrest in ED), and
   extubated on [**2151-3-16**], without difficulty.
   .
   #Hypotension: Combination of arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, and
   positive pressure ventilation, initially on 3-pressors which were
   weaned off.  Not likely to be sepsis as culture data negative, although
   patient was treated empirically for VAP.
   - Maintain lisinopril and BB at low-dose.  Initially secondary to
   ventricular tachycardia, and response to sedatives s/p intubation.
   Initially on three pressors but weaned off for a short period, still
   requiring intermittently.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Has right and left sided
   heart failure, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair. Low-dose
   metoprolol and lisinopril.
   - Euvolemic for now, goal I/O even
   .
   #Gout: holding allopurinol and colchicine for renal failure

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of Ebstein's anomaly, who has undergone tricuspid valve reconstruction and ASD repair. He presented with unstable ventricular tachycardia and was successfully resuscitated. The patient is currently intubated due to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has now resolved. He experienced hypotension likely due to arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, and positive pressure ventilation. The patient's chronic systolic congestive heart failure is managed with low-dose metoprolol and lisinopril. He also has a history of gout, but allopurinol and colchicine are being held for renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's recent episode of unstable ventricular tachycardia could recur, potentially leading to another cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the underlying causes such as congestive heart failure or obstructive sleep apnea are not adequately managed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could recur if the underlying causes like arrhythmia or cardiogenic shock are not properly addressed.
4. Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen over time, leading to further complications such as fluid overload or decreased cardiac output.
