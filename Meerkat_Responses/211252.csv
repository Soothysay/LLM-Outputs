   #. Hematemesis: History of NSAID gastritis on recent admission, EGD
   performed this admission showed healing gastric mucosa but no clear
   source of bleeding.  GI thinks that patient may have a small bowel
   source of bleeding, although crohns is low likelihood.
   - Will touch base with GI about need for further imaging now that
   post-transfusion hct suggests bleeding has stopped

   #. Tachycardia: Improved at rest, but continues to have tachycardia

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with a history of NSAID gastritis admitted for repeat upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She presented with melena, and an endoscopy showed erosions in the fundus and some gastritis, with healing in the antrum. The possibility of lesions further down in the GI tract, especially in the small bowel, was considered to account for the melena. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss. She received a blood transfusion to increase her Hct to 33.8%. She is currently stable and comfortable, with no dizziness, lightheadedness, or abdominal pain. Her nausea from the previous day has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis: The patient has a history of NSAID gastritis and previous upper GI bleed. Although the recent endoscopy showed healing gastric mucosa, there is still a possibility of ongoing or recurrent bleeding, possibly from a small bowel source. Close monitoring and further imaging may be necessary to identify the source and prevent future bleeding episodes.

2. Tachycardia: The patient continues to have tachycardia, especially with exertion. This is likely due to volume loss and anemia. Continued volume resuscitation and monitoring on telemetry will help manage this condition.

3. Insomnia: The patient is experiencing insomnia, and she will continue taking Seroquel (an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female with a history of NSAID gastritis who was admitted for repeat upper GI bleed. She presented with melena, which is a sign of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopy showed erosions in the fundus and some gastritis, with the antrum healing. There are concerns about possible lesions further down in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the small bowel, to account for the melena. The patient's lesions are expected to take up to a month or more to heal. She has been receiving various medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a sinus tachycardia. Her blood pressure is on the lower side, but within normal limits. She has received blood transfusions and is being closely monitored for any changes. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) in case further procedures are needed. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The flow sheet data shows that she has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products, with a slight negative fluid balance. Her laboratory results indicate a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. The patient's white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits. Imaging studies have revealed abnormal mucosa in the stomach, consistent with gastritis, but no active bleeding or signs of recent bleeding were noted. The patient's assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleed, tachycardia, insomnia, and history of narcotic abuse. She is currently being managed in the ICU with close monitoring and appropriate interventions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and had a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 26 overnight, which led to a 1 unit packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. An endoscopy was performed, revealing healing lesions but with positive nasogastric (NG) lavage for blood in the emergency department (ED). The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate (HR) of 89 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 122/67 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for right lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. Blood glucose, creatinine (Cr), and electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Given the patient's history of GIB, there is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the underlying cause has not been completely treated or if there are other undiagnosed lesions.
2. Infection: As the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)"
