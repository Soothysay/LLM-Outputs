   Assessment and Plan
   79F h/o asthma, diastolic CHF, [**Hospital 1483**] transferred from OSH after
   admission for pna c/b hypoxic respiratory failure, afib with rvr, ARF
   requiring HD, pulmonary edema.
   # hypotension - likely multifactorial, feel most likely sepsis given
   ongoing fevers, probable pulmonary source ie. VAP, ddx also includes
   adrenal insuficiency given recent steroid dosing vs cardiogenic shock
   (+trop, but CK flat, EKG without ischemic changes) vs hypovolemic shock
   (though volume up, hct stable, potential GI and pulmonary losses).
   - wean levaphed gtt as possible
   - transduce CVP, currently 15.
   - repeat cultures here, bcx, ucx, sputum (all pending)
   - f/u glucan/galactomannan
   - f/u OSH cultures for PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
   - continue cefepime, iv vanco by level, flagyl tid given h/o cdiff.
   - hold off on fungal coverage for now pending repeat sputum sample.
   - hydrocortizone 100mg TID given prolonged steroid course
   - consider RUQ USN to eval for biliary source if tbil rising.
   - repeat TTE pending
   - TSH elevated, restarted synthroid home dose
   # hypoxia -  feel most likley CHF with underlying PNA, and ?bloody
   clots on bronch concerning for pulmonary-renal syndromes (per report,
   anca, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, no renal biopsy, no evidence of nephritic
   syndrome).  pt also with h/o asthma, admission CT CHEST from OSH showed
   bilateral lower lobe infiltrate, s/p multiple course of antibiotics,
   intubated [**1-15**] for hypoxic respiratory failure, s/p multiple bronch's
   showing [**Female First Name (un) 188**] and diffuse blood clots, most recently concerning for
   VAP in setting of prolonged intubation.  feel PE less likely given
   recently supratherapeutic INR, and multiple other reasons for hypoxia.
   presently.  negative LENIs at OSH on [**2129-12-31**].
   - abg improved on PEEP of 10 & FiO2 60%
   - continue nebs prn for reactive airways, avoid solumedrol as no
   wheezing currently.
   - plan for HD in AM to remove fluid, if tolerated by BPs (may need
   CVVHD).
   - continue broad spectrum abx for presumed VAP
   - f/u induced sputum cx with fungal and pcp cx here.
   - consider repeat bronch given ?history of bloody clots (?goodpastures,
   will need to f/u on OSH biopsy and CT scans).
   - frequent pulmonary suction/toilet.
   - plan to call gen surgery for trach/peg placement in AM, however pt's
   hcp would like to discuss with family.
   - f/u osh hsv culture from bronch (s/p course acyclovir).
   - non-contrast CT CHEST to evaluate parenchyma further and to help
   guide potential bronch in AM.
   .
   # GI - h/o GIB in [**2127**] per OSH records, hct down to 24 at OSH, no
   obvious source, though currently with ?coffee grounds from OGT, only on
   sucralfate at OSH.  etiology of elevated LFTs unclear, AP elevated,
   tbil wnl, this feel biliary process unlikely.
   - start PPI iv bid now.
   - continue sucralfate.
   - cycle HCT in AM.
   - t&s in place, has multiple access currently (TLC, PICC)
   - hold TF.
   - consider EGD in AM to evaluate for gastritis/ulcer.
   - trend LFTs.
   - fractionate AP to evaluate source.
   .
   ## ischemia: asa and plavix held in setting of pulmonary hemhorrage, pt
   is s/p MI [**2127**] with stent placement.
   - cycle HCT tommorow, if stable, would favor restarting asa first then
   plavix.
   - no evidence of ischemia on EKG, +trop likely [**12-24**] ARF.
   ## rythym: new afib during OSH admission in setting of pulmonary
   processes, rate relatively well controlled at present, 90-100s without
   medication, had been on diltiazem gtt at transfer, though d/c'd given
   ongoing hypotension.  now levo gtt likely contributing somewhat.
   - follow rate, reintroduce BB once tolerated by BPs given h/o CAD.
   - avoiding anticoagulation for now given pulmonary hemorhage.
   .
   ## pump: clinically grossly volume overloaded, EF=60-65% [**2130-1-2**],
   likely has some dCHF (rvsp 41mmhg).
   - plan for HD vs CVVH in AM.
   - reintroduce ace/[**Last Name (un) **] as tolerated by ARF.
   - repeat TTE in AM.
   .
   # ARF/CRI - currently in oliguric renal failure, requiring HD, etiology
   unclear, CRI s/p cardiac cath [**2127**] requiring HD, never returned to
   [**Location 848**], upon admission [**12-7**] (bl 1.6-1.8), creatinine ~1.7->2.8->1.3,
   then worsening steadily cause remains unclear (ddx ""hemodynamic stress""
   (documented BPs 80/30s) vs AIN from multiple abx vs possible contrast
   (none documented) vs pulmonary-renal syndromes (no documented sediments
   on OSH records, renal usn shows no hydro).  currently making some
   urine.
   - on aranesp 150mcg q4wks, last dose [**2129-12-1**].
   - renal consult.
   - plan for HD [**1-30**], though may need CVVH if still on pressors.
   - repeat UA to check for active sediment (QNS first sample)
   - renally dose meds.
   - check urine eos.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] neutraphos for low phos.
   #DM2 - was on NPH 20 QAM, 5U QPM, then increased to levamir 30U Q12H on
   [**12-9**] after started on decadron for reactive airways, most recently
   receiving 8U levamir QAM, with humalog SSI, with reasonably good FSBS
   recently (has had some hypoglycemic episodes).
   - will place on 8U glargine QAM, and cover with HISS, adjust as needed,
   will check FSBS q2hr for now given steroids.
   # HEME/ONC - anemia [**12-24**] CKD. plt droped from 280s to 20s per OSH notes,
   though felt likely [**12-24**] infection, currently 100s.  HITT negative at
   OSH.  feel more likley [**12-24**] infection vs medication.
   - check hemolysis and DIC labs, peripheral smear.
   - t&s in place.
   - guaic stools, follow pulmonary secretions.
   - holding asa/plavix for now.
   .
   # hypothyroid - not currently on home dose synthroid, unclear why not.
   - tsh 11 here, will add ft4, total t4.
   - restart home dose of synthroid (dose unclear, 1 note with 100mcg po
   qdaily -> will use 50mcg iv qdaily for now.
   # RA - no evidence of inflammatory joints presently, per family, not on
   any RA medications.
   .
   # gout - no evidence of joint involvement presently, per family, not on
   any gout medications, though single note from OSH mentions allopurinol.
   .
   # SKIN - multiple areas of skin breakdown, though no frank ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of asthma, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and recent pneumonia (pna) complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with rvr), acute renal failure (ARF) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and pulmonary edema. She was admitted to the ICU for further management.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced ongoing fevers, probable pulmonary source (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP), and possible adrenal insufficiency given recent steroid dosing versus cardiogenic shock (+trop, but CK flat, EKG without ischemic changes) vs hypovolemic shock (though volume up, hct stable, potential GI and pulmonary losses).
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to CHF with underlying PNA, and possibly bloody clots on bronch concerning for pulmonary-renal syndromes (per report, anca, [Doctor First Name] negative, no renal biopsy, no evidence of nephritic syndrome).
3. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding in [2127] per OSH records, with hct down to 24 at OSH, no obvious source, though currently with coffee grounds from OGT, only on sucralfate at OSH. Etiology of elevated liver function tests (LFTs) unclear, alkaline phosphatase (AP) elevated, total bilirubin (tbill) within normal limits, feel biliary process unlikely.
4. Ischemia: The patient is s/p MI [2127] with stent placement, ASA and Plavix held in setting of pulmonary hemorrhage. No evidence of ischemia on EKG, +trop likely [12-24] ARF.
5. Rhythm: The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation during OSH admission in setting of pulmonary processes, rate relatively well-controlled at present, 90-100s without medication, had been on diltiazem gtt at transfer, though discontinued given ongoing hypotension. Now on levo gtt likely contributing somewhat.
6. Pump dysfunction: Clinically grossly volume overloaded, ejection fraction (EF) 60-65% [2130-1-2], likely has some dCHF (right ventricular systolic pressure 41mmHg). Plan for HD vs CVVH in AM.
7. Acute Renal Failure (ARF)/Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRI): The patient is currently in oliguric renal failure, requiring HD, etiology unclear, CRI s/p cardiac cath [2127] requiring HD, never returned to [Location 848], upon admission [12-7] (blood urea nitrogen 1"

   # Hypotension
 Etiology most likely [**12-24**] sepsis with multiple
   infectious sources, elev WBC ct & bandemia.  Cardiogenic less likely &
   hypovolemic possible, but did not respond to fluid challenge.  Other
   etiologies include: abd compartment syndrome, adrenal insufficiency &
   hypothyroidism.  Infectious sources include RIJ, VAP, skin ulcers &
   gastritis/GI bleed, sinusitis.  Will get CT Head/Chest/Abd/Pelv to
   evaluate for infectious source given prolonged hospital stay & long
   term intubation.  Transaminitis & Alk phos may be due to invasive
   fungal infection.  Will d/w radiology regarding measuremt for abd

   # Hypoxia - Etiology of prolonged hypoxia likely due to PNA & massive
   volume overload, pt may now have additional VAP complicating pulm
   process.  Pt has h/o bloody clots on bronch concerning for
   pulmonary-renal syndromes (per report, anca, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, no renal
   biopsy, no evidence of nephritic syndrome).  pt also with h/o asthma,
   admission CT CHEST from OSH showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrate, s/p
   multiple course of antibiotics, intubated [**1-15**] for hypoxic respiratory
   failure, s/p multiple bronch's showing [**Female First Name (un) 188**] and diffuse blood clots,
   most recently concerning for VAP in setting of prolonged intubation.
   ABGs improved on PEEP of 10 & FiO2 60%
   - continue nebs prn for reactive airways ( no need for addl steroids)
   - consulting renal for HD &  plan for aggressive volume removal as BP
   will tolerate (may need CVVH)
   - continue broad spectrum abx for presumed VAP- f/u ID recs
   - f/u induced sputum cx with fungal and pcp cx here.
   - f/u chest CT to better evaluate lung fields (consider bronch in

   # GI - h/o GIB in [**2127**] per OSH records.  Pt currently has e/o coffee
   grounds from OGT, only on sucralfate at OSH while receiving high dose
   steroids for >4wks. Etiology of elevated LFTs unclear, AP elevated, but
   T. Bili is WNL.   Transaminitis & Alk phos may be due to invasive
   fungal infection.    Concern for GI bleed, holding TF for now.
   -  f/u Abd CT, consider GI consult in am
   - start PPI iv bid now.
   - continue sucralfate.
   - follow HCT [**Hospital1 **], maintain active T& S
   - consider EGD in AM to evaluate for gastritis/ulcer.
   - trend LFTdaily, f/u ggt
   # ARF/CRI - currently in oliguric renal failure, requiring HD, etiology
   unclear, CRI s/p cardiac cath [**2127**] requiring HD, never returned to
   [**Location 848**], upon admission [**12-7**] (bl 1.6-1.8), creatinine ~1.7->2.8->1.3,
   then worsening steadily cause remains unclear (ddx ""hemodynamic stress""
   (documented BPs 80/30s) vs AIN from multiple abx vs possible contrast
   (none documented) vs pulmonary-renal syndromes (no documented urinary
   sediments on OSH records, renal u/s shows no e/o hydronephrosis).
   - on aranesp 150mcg q4wks, last dose [**2129-12-1**].
   - renal consult,  plan for HD [**1-30**], though may need CVVH if still on
   pressors.
   - repeat UA & urine eos, evaluate for active sediment
   - renally dose meds.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] neutraphos for low phos.

   ## CV: Pt with CAD s/p stenting in [**2127**].  Asa and plavix held in
   setting of pulmonary hemhorrage. There was no evidence of ischemia on
   EKG, +trop likely [**12-24**] ARF. Pt developed afib during OSH adm in setting
   of pulmonary processes, rate relatively well controlled at present,
   90-100s without medication, had been on diltiazem gtt at transfer,
   though d/c'd given ongoing hypotension.   Pt massively volume
   overloaded, thought recent TTE from OSH showed elev LVEF, likely
   diastolic CHF.
   - consulting renal, needs dialysis for fluid removal
   - monitor HR, can use BB once tolerated by BPs given h/o CAD.
   - holding ASA & plavix for now, monitor hct [**Hospital1 **] given possible GI bleed
   - avoiding anticoagulation for now given pulmonary hemorrhage &
   possible GI bleed
   - f/u TTE today
   #DM2
 Pt was on NPH 20 QAM, 5U QPM, then increased to levamir 30U Q12H
   on [**12-9**] after started on decadron for reactive airways, most recently
   receiving 8U levamir QAM, with humalog SSI, with reasonably good FSBS
   recently (has had some hypoglycemic episodes).
   - 8U glargine QAM, and cover with HISS, adjust as needed
   - check FSBS q2hr for now given steroids.
   # HEME/ONC
 Pt with anemia [**12-24**] CKD. Thrombocytopenia noted on OSH
   records with a nadir of 20 000. Etiology unclear but attributed to
   infection.  HITT negative at OSH.  Plts stable in 100s now,
   fibrinogen/LDH/haptoglobin elevated making hemolysis & DIC unlikely.
   Low plts was likely [**12-24**] medication toxicity
   - f/u peripheral smear.
   - t&s in place.
   - guaic stools, follow pulmonary secretions.
   - holding asa/plavix for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of asthma, diastolic congestive heart failure, and pneumonia who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple infections, including respiratory, urinary, and skin infections. She also has acute kidney injury, likely secondary to volume overload and the use of nephrotoxic medications. Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, lactate, and lactic acid levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and albumin levels. Imaging studies reveal bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient has also had multiple positive blood cultures.

   Assessment and Plan
   Long admission at [**Hospital1 **], 79F h/o asthma, dCHF, [**Hospital 1483**]
   transferred from OSH after admission for pna c/b hypoxic respiratory
   failure, afib with rvr, ARF requiring HD, pulmonary edema.
   Presented with SOB, cough. Bronch revealed blood clots while on
   coumadin for HIT ab. Increasing O2 requirements, question of CHF,
   diuresed. Tx with broad spectrum Abx. Rectus sheath hematoma with INR
   3.8. Baseline renal insufficiency with acute on CRF. With increased
   diuresis, became oliguric and started on CVVH on [**1-15**]. + cdiff tx with
   course of flagyl. Was treated with steroids x ~ 4 weeks. C albicans
   grew from bronch- tx with voriconazole. Alk phos rise with no obvious
   source. Platelets decreased, question due to voriconazole.
   1. Hypotension: agree this is multifactorial. Unclear if new septic
   process (line concerning, skin breakdown, ? new VAP, etc.) vs adrenal
   insufficiency (did not respond on [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim but seemed to respond to
   steroids). In setting of low albumin and 25 kg positive balance, very
   likely intravascular vol depletion d/t third spacing. Currently CVP up
   so unlikely. Also possible is [**Last Name (un) 499**] compartment syndrome - will
   transduce bladder pressure.
   F/u on cultures. Continue Vanc/Cef/Flagyl - reasonable to consult ID.
   2. Respiratory failure: volume overload and mental status are barriers
   to extubation. Will avoid sedation and wean as tolerated.
   3. Acute renal failure on HD - oliguric with volume overload, baseline
   creat was ~ 1.6
   4. Question of pulmonary hemorrhage - work up for vasculitis negative.
   5: ID: fever, leukocytosis with multiple possible sources. Dialysis
   catheter has purulent drainage and erythema at site (will need to be
   d/c'd), ? VAP, ulcers, etc. F/u cultures. On broad coverage.
   6. AFib -  on dilt drip
   7. Anemia with ? GI Bleed - f/u hct. Hx of GI bleed in [**2127**], coffee
   grounds in OGT. Hold tube feeds for now.
   8. Lines - will need to change dialysis catheter and PICC. Will send
   tips for culture.
   9. cardiac - no evidence of ischemia presently, agree that positive
   trop likely [**12-24**] ARF. Pt is s/p MI [**2127**] with stent placement. EF=60-65%
   [**2130-1-2**], likely has some dCHF (rvsp 41mmhg).
   10. DM2 - on glargine insulin and SS. Follow FS closely while on
   steroids
   11. Thrombocytopenia - resolving, question of voriconazole as cause, hx
   of HIT but no documented heparin at OSH
   12. hypothyroid - not currently on home dose synthroid, unclear why
   not. TSH 11 with low fT4. Levothyroxine IV restarted.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with multiple comorbidities including asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of acute renal failure (ARF). She was admitted to the hospital due to pneumonia (pna) with hypoxic respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with rvr). The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to various reasons such as septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, or intravascular volume depletion. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and has a low oxygen saturation level. This could be attributed to fluid overload and mental status barriers to extubation. Weaning off sedation and monitoring the patient's response is recommended.

3. Acute renal failure on hemodialysis (HD): The patient's renal function has deteriorated further, and she is currently on HD. However, she is oliguric with volume overload, indicating that her kidneys are not producing enough urine despite the presence of excess fluid in her body.

4. Question of pulmonary hemorrhage: There is suspicion of pulmonary hemorrhage, but the workup for vasculitis has been negative. Further evaluation is necessary to confirm or rule out this condition.

5. Infectious disease (ID): The patient presents with fever, leukocyt"

   79F h/o asthma, diastolic CHF, [**Hospital 1483**] transferred from OSH after
   admission for pna c/b hypoxic respiratory failure, afib with rvr, ARF
   requiring HD, pulmonary edema.
   # Hypotension
 weaned off pressors, etiology most likely [**12-24**] sepsis
   with multiple infectious sources, GPCs in blood/urine, sensi pending.
   Hypothyroidism less likely.  Infectious sources include VAP, skin
   ulcers & gastritis/GI bleed, sinusitis, rectus sheath hematoma.
   Transaminitis & Alk phos may be due to disseminated candidal infection
   infiltrating liver.
   - continue broad spectrum ABx with now Day 2 Linezolid, Meropenem,
   Caspofungin & Flagyl, f/u ID recs
   - f/u culture tips
   - f/u urine, blood, sputum cultures, f/u glucan/galactomannan
   - hydrocortizone 100mg TID given prolonged steroid course.
   - repeat TTE pending
   - TSH elev, free T4 & T3 low, continue Levothyroxine 50mcg IV
   # Hypoxia - Etiology of prolonged hypoxia likely due to PNA & massive
   volume overload, pt may now have additional VAP complicating pulm
   process.  Pt has h/o bloody clots on bronch concerning for
   pulmonary-renal syndromes (per report, anca, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, no renal
   biopsy, no evidence of nephritic syndrome).  pt also with h/o asthma,
   admission CT CHEST from OSH showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrate, s/p
   multiple course of antibiotics, intubated [**1-15**] for hypoxic respiratory
   failure, s/p multiple bronch's showing [**Female First Name (un) 188**] and diffuse blood clots,
   most recently concerning for VAP in setting of prolonged intubation.
   Having difficulty with oxygenation, ? ETT placement & volume vs
   worsening infection ARDS?
   - continue HD &  plan for aggressive volume removal as BP will tolerate
   - continue broad spectrum abx for presumed VAP- f/u ID recs
   - f/u induced sputum cx with fungal and pcp cx here.
   - f/u chest CT to better evaluate lung fields (consider bronch in
   future)
   - ongoing discussion with family regarding trach placement
   - f/u osh hsv culture from bronch (s/p course acyclovir).
   .
   # GI - h/o GIB in [**2127**] per OSH records.  Pt currently has e/o coffee
   grounds from OGT, only on sucralfate at OSH while receiving high dose
   steroids for >4wks. Etiology of elevated LFTs unclear, AP elevated, but
   T. Bili is WNL.   Transaminitis & Alk phos may be due to invasive
   fungal infection.    HCT eesentially stable around 33, continue [**Hospital1 **]
   hcts
   - start PPI iv bid now.
   - continue sucralfate.
   - maintain active T& S
   - consider EGD in AM to evaluate for gastritis/ulcer.
   - LFTs suggest diffuse liver process
   # ARF/CRI - currently in oliguric renal failure, requiring HD, etiology
   unclear, CRI s/p cardiac cath [**2127**] requiring HD, never returned to
   [**Location 848**], upon admission [**12-7**] (bl 1.6-1.8), creatinine ~1.7->2.8->1.3,
   then worsening steadily cause remains unclear (ddx ""hemodynamic stress""
   (documented BPs 80/30s) vs AIN from multiple abx vs possible contrast
   (none documented) vs pulmonary-renal syndromes (no documented urinary
   sediments on OSH records, renal u/s shows no e/o hydronephrosis).
   - on aranesp 150mcg q4wks, last dose [**2129-12-1**].
   - renal consult,  for HD
   - Urine eose negative
   - renally dose meds.
   .
   ## CV: Pt with CAD s/p stenting in [**2127**].  Asa and plavix held in
   setting of pulmonary hemhorrage. There was no evidence of ischemia on
   EKG, +trop likely [**12-24**] ARF. Pt developed afib during OSH adm in setting
   of pulmonary processes, rate relatively well controlled at present,
   90-100s without medication, had been on diltiazem gtt at transfer,
   though d/c'd given ongoing hypotension.   Pt massively volume
   overloaded, thought recent TTE from OSH showed elev LVEF, likely
   diastolic CHF.
   - consulting renal, needs dialysis for fluid removal
   - monitor HR, can use BB once tolerated by BPs given h/o CAD.
   - holding ASA & plavix for now, monitor hct [**Hospital1 **] given possible GI bleed
   - avoiding anticoagulation for now given pulmonary hemorrhage &
   possible GI bleed
   - f/u TTE today
   #DM2
 Pt was on NPH 20 QAM, 5U QPM, then increased to levamir 30U Q12H
   on [**12-9**] after started on decadron for reactive airways, most recently
   receiving 8U levamir QAM, with humalog SSI, with reasonably good FSBS
   recently (has had some hypoglycemic episodes).
   - 8U glargine QAM, and cover with HISS, adjust as needed
   - check FSBS q2hr for now given steroids.
   # HEME/ONC
 Pt with anemia [**12-24**] CKD. Thrombocytopenia noted on OSH
   records with a nadir of 20 000. Etiology unclear but attributed to
   infection.  HITT negative at OSH.  Plts stable in 100s now,
   fibrinogen/LDH/haptoglobin elevated making hemolysis & DIC unlikely.
   Low plts was likely [**12-24**] medication toxicity
   - smear shows only occais schistocytes
   - type & screen active
   - guaic stools, follow pulmonary secretions.
   - holding asa/plavix for now.

   # hypothyroid
 Pt was not continued on home synthroid dose at OSH &
   TSH now elevated, T3/T4 low.
   - starting Synthroid 50mcg iv qdaily for now
   # SKIN - multiple areas of skin breakdown, though no frank ulcers.
   - wound care consult

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of asthma, diastolic congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, hypoxia, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis with multiple infectious sources.

The patient's current medications include linezolid, meropenem, caspofungin, Flagyl, hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, and an anemia medication. She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, but she has low levels of calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Her arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals anasarca, generalized edema, and diffuse abdominal edema. She has end-expiratory wheezes and bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. Her abdominal ultrasound shows a right rectus sheath hematoma and small amount of perihepatic and right paracolic ascites.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing hemodialysis, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and aggressive fluid removal."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is an unknown allergy to heparin agents and succinylcholine. The patient underwent a procedure yesterday, during which a PICC line was placed but forgotten to be cultured. Hemodialysis (HD) was performed last night, removing 2.4 liters of fluid. The patient also had a radial internal jugular (RIJ) catheter removed and sent for culture. 

The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics including linezolid, caspofungin, meropenem, and flagyl, while previously being on cefepime and vancomycin. The patient is also receiving medications such as pantoprazole, midazolam, and flowsheet data including vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on insulin gtt but not ordered due to concerns about fluid status. The patient's weight is 113.2 kg, and height is 66 inches. The patient's blood pressure is 132/64 mmHg, heart rate is 109 bpm, respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 92%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 0 mmHg, bladder pressure is 18 mmHg, and fluid intake/output balance shows a total in of 2,627 mL and a total out of 40 mL. 

Radiology findings include no acute intracranial pathology, right rectus sheath hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema compatible with congestive failure, atrophic left kidney, small amount of perihepatic and right paracolic ascites, fluid-filled colon may represent colitis, soft tissue swelling, and endotracheal tube positioned at the carina oriented towards the right main stem bronchus.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, decreased sodium, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated creatinine, elevated troponin-T, decreased calcium, decreased magnesium, decreased albumin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), decreased phosphate, and other abnormalities.

The patient's medical conditions include right rectus sheath hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema compatible with congestive failure, atrophic left kidney, small amount of perihepatic and right paracolic ascites, fluid-filled colon may represent colitis, soft tissue swelling, and endotracheal tube positioned at the carina oriented towards the right main stem bronchus.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include but are not limited to:

1. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. The cultures from the PICC line and RIJ catheter need to be monitored for any signs of infection.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has a high fluid intake/output balance and evidence of pulmonary edema, indicating a risk of fluid overload.
3. Renal impairment: The patient has an atrophic left kidney and elevated BUN and creatinine levels, suggesting renal impairment.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and there are signs of pulmonary edema, indicating a risk of respiratory distress.
5. Thrombosis: The patient has an unknown allergy to heparin agents, which increases the risk of thrombosis.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The presence of fluid-filled colon may represent colitis, indicating potential gastrointestinal issues.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency. She was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She also has anemia of chronic disease and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fever, hypoxia, and sepsis with growth of gram-positive cocci from blood and urine cultures. She has a right rectus sheath hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and ascites. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, lactate, and liver enzymes. Renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including linezolid, meropenem, caspofungin, and Flagyl. She is also on hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, and insulin for glycemic control. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and new infiltrates on chest X-ray could indicate this condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), and massive volume overload. The patient has multiple infectious sources including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), skin ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), urinary tract infection (UTI), and colitis. She also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple infectious sources, and her vital signs indicate hypotension and fever, which could suggest sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of prolonged intubation, and her chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema, which are consistent with VAP.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), and her renal function is worsening.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB and is currently experiencing coffee grounds emesis.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not mentioned explicitly, the patient's history of diabetes mellitus (DM2) and elevated blood glucose levels may predispose her to DKA.

   Assessment and Plan
    1. Enterococcal sepsis / ID issues: likely from urine source. On
   Linezolid, Meropenem, and caspofungin.  Line infection still possible.
   All old lines removed. Skin breakdown but unlikely source of infection.
   Treated with stress dose steroids despite neg [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim. BP improved.
   In setting of low albumin and 25 kg positive balance, this is
   distributive shock. [**Last Name (un) **] compartment syndrome ruled out with bladder
   pressure. Increase in wbc today but afeb. F/u on all cultures.
   2. Respiratory failure: volume overload and mental status are barriers
   to extubation. Will avoid sedation and wean as tolerated. Question of
   pulmonary hemorrhage - unlikely, negative serologies...
   3. Acute renal failure on HD - oliguric with severe volume overload and
   increasing FiO2 requirements. Baseline creat was ~ 1.6. Dialysed and
   ultrafiltrated yesterday. Plan is to hold on inserting new dialysis
   catheter for 2-3 days due to bacteremia. In meantime, will try to
   diurese with high dose lasix.
   4. AFib -  on dilt drip
   5. Anemia with ? GI Bleed - f/u hct. Hx of GI bleed in [**2127**], coffee
   grounds in OGT. Hold tube feeds for now.
   6. Lines - f/u on line tip culture (dialysis catheter tip sent). New
   PICC [**1-30**].
   7. Elevated troponins
 likely all demand ischemia. Pt is s/p MI [**2127**]
   with stent placement. EF=60-65% [**2130-1-2**], likely has some dCHF (rvsp
   41mmhg). Will start beta blocker. Not candidate for ASA yet.
   8. DM2 - on glargine insulin and SS. Follow FS closely while on
   steroids
   9. Thrombocytopenia - resolving, question of voriconazole as cause, hx
   of HIT but no documented heparin at OSH
   10. hypothyroid -  TSH 11 with low fT4. Levothyroxine IV started.
   11. Hx of RA, gout - no evidence of inflammatory joints presently, per
   family, not on any RA or gout medications.
   12. Skin breakdown - skin care
   13. Bilat pleural effusions - left effusion appears loculated
   14. Alk phos elvation - possible acalculous chole. RUQ ultrasound will
   be ordered

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of asthma, congestive heart failure, and previous hospitalization for pneumonia complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and pulmonary edema. The patient presented with shortness of breath, cough, and blood clots while on coumadin for HIT antibodies. She has been diagnosed with enterococcal sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, anemia with possible gastrointestinal bleed, lines, elevated troponins indicating myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, skin breakdown, and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Enterococcal sepsis: The patient is currently being treated with linezolid, meropenem, and caspofungin due to suspected enterococcal sepsis. However, there is still a possibility of line infection as old lines have been removed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing volume overload and mental status issues, making extubation difficult. There is also a question of pulmonary hemorrhage, but serologies are negative.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient"

   Labs / Radiology:
   ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
   ([**11-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: hyperdynamic, hypertrophic left ventricle with small cavity
   dimension; atrial fibrillation
   CXR from [**1-31**]
   FINDINGS:  The ETT has been exchanged and is seen to terminate in the t
   rachea
   in unaltered position with a distance to the carina of about 4 cm.  No
   pneumothorax has developed.  The NG tube remains in place reaching far
   below
   the diaphragm.  The on the preceding study identified multiple nodular
   and
   confluent densities persist.  They may even have increased further.  [**Hospital1 **]
   lateral
   basal densities partially obliterating the lateral pleural sinuses are
   suggestive of coexisting pleural effusions.  Within the heart shadow, a
   semicircular density suggests calcification in the mitral valve ring.
   IMPRESSION:  Appropriate ETT position after repositioning.  Advanced [**Hospital1 **]
   lateral
   pulmonary densities remain.  No pneumothorax developed.

   # Hypotension
recurred this am, likely due to versed vs missing Abx
   dose and ongoing sepsis. Original etiology most likely [**12-24**] sepsis with
   GPCs growing from blood & urine, primary source unclear. Infectious
   sources include VAP, skin ulcers & GI bleed, UTI, colitis, rectus
   sheath hematoma. Pt with mild transaminitis, alk phos, LDH elevation
   may be due to CMV viremia infiltrating liver vs occult malignancy.
   - continue broad spectrum ABx with now Day 3 Linezolid, Meropenem,
   Caspofungin & Flagyl, f/u ID recs
   - f/u culture tips, urine, blood, sputum cultures (GPCs from blood are
   VRE, sensitivity to linezolid & dapto pending)
   - f/u glucan/galactomannan
   - weaning hydrocortizone to 25mg TID today
   - starting Gancyclovir dosed for CVVH today
   - TSH elev, free T4 & T3 low, continue Levothyroxine 100mcg po
   # Hypoxia - Etiology of prolonged hypoxia likely due to PNA & massive
   volume overload, pt may now have additional VAP complicating pulm
   process.  Pt has h/o bloody clots on bronch concerning for
   pulmonary-renal syndromes  but ANCA/[**Doctor First Name 1205**] negative, anti GBM pending. Pt
   having difficulty oxygenating o/n, barriers are massive volume overload
   and possible VAP.  Will f/u am ABG after increasing FiO2.
   - f/u ABG & monitor sats, will continue to increase FiO2 if necessary
   - d/w renal today, will need HD for aggressive volume removal (this is
   most correctable barrier to oxygenation)
   - continue broad spectrum abx for presumed VAP- f/u ID recs
   - f/u induced sputum cx (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**])
   - surgery consulted for trach placement, waiting for pt to be less PEEP
   dependant
   .
   # GI - h/o GIB in [**2127**] & pt p/w coffee grounds in OGT, only on
   sucralfate at OSH while receiving high dose steroids for >4wks. High
   suspician of gastritis vs ulcer.  Today, OGT residuals have been clear.
   Etiology of elevated LFTs unclear, AP & LDH elevated, but T. Bili is
   WNL.  Transaminitis & Alk phos may be due to CMV virus, but unusual
   presentation.  Given new CMV viremia, will begin occult malignancy work
   up & HIV screen when consentable. HCT continues to be stable.
   - continue PPI iv bid & sucralfate.
   - maintain active T& S
   - f/u RUQ U/S today to r/o acalculous cholecyst.
   - LFTs suggest diffuse liver process, unclear if this is due to CMV
   viremia, will discuss Rx with ID
   - continue TF & monitor residuals
   .
   # ARF/CRI - currently in oliguric renal failure, requiring HD.
   Etiology unclear, baseline creatinine ~1.2 to 1.7 and suffered an
   insult during OSH course resulting in oliguric RF.  Differential
   includes ATN vs drug toxicity.  Pt with massive volume overload likely
   biggest correctable barrier to oxygenation.
   - renal consult,  for HD having issues with hypotension during
   dialysis, will likely need CVVH
   - f/u urine sediment with renal
   - Urine eos negative
   - renally dose meds.
   .
   # CV: Pt with CAD s/p stenting in [**2127**], ASA & Plavix held in setting of
   ?pulm hemorrhage. There was no evidence of ischemia on EKG, +trop
   likely [**12-24**] ARF. Pt developed afib during OSH adm in setting of
   pulmonary processes, rate relatively well controlled at present,
   90-110s but spikes up to 140s intermittently.  Pt massively volume
   overloaded, ECHO shows hyperdynamic LVEF of 70-80% & small cavity size,
   2+ TR & MR.
   - consulting renal, will likely need CVVH for fluid removal
   - monitor HR, continue Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ASA 81mg, continue to monitor hct [**Hospital1 **] given possible GI
   bleed
   #DM2
 At OSH, pt was on NPH 20 QAM, 5U QPM, then increased to levamir
   30U Q12H on [**12-9**] after started on decadron for reactive airways, most
   recently receiving 8U levamir QAM, with humalog SSI, with reasonably
   good FSBS recently (has had some hypoglycemic episodes).
   - 8U glargine QAM, and cover with HISS (BS running in 150 range)
   - check FSBS q2hr for now given steroids.
   - avoiding insulin gtt due large volume fluid load due to high insulin
   requiremts
   - f/u endocrine recs
   # HEME/ONC
 Pt with anemia thought [**12-24**] to CKD & profound
   thrombocytopenia noted on OSH with nadir of 20 000. Etiology unclear
   but attributed to infection vs med toxicity.  HITT negative at OSH.
   Plts stable in 100s.  Fibrinogen/LDH & haptoglobin elevated making
   hemolysis & DIC unlikely.  Elev LDH, CMV viremia concerning for lymph
   malignancy or other immunocomprom Dz.  Plan to review CT with radiology
   ?lymphadenopathy.  Will consent for HIV screen when alert.
   - f/u IgG panel, SPEP, UPEP, Flow cytometry
   - repeating HIT Ab
   - smear shows only occais schistocytes
   - type & screen active, continue ASA 81mg daily
   - guaic all stools

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension this morning, which may be due to Versed (midazolam) versus missing antibiotic doses and ongoing sepsis.

2. Hypoxia: The etiology of prolonged hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia (PNA) and massive volume overload. The patient also has a history of bloody clots on bronch, which could indicate pulmonary-renal syndromes. However, ANCA tests were negative, and anti GBM pending. The patient's difficulty in oxygenating overnight is attributed to massive volume overload and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

3. GI: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in December and presented with coffee grounds in OGT. The patient was on sucralfate at OSH while receiving high-dose steroids for over four weeks. High suspicion of gastritis versus ulcer. Today's OGT residuals have been clear. The elevated liver function tests (LFTs) may be due to CMV viremia infiltrating the liver or occult malignancy.

4. ARF/CRI: The patient is currently in oliguric renal failure, requiring hemodialysis"

   Assessment and Plan
    1. VRE sepsis / CMV viremia / other ID issues: likely from urine
   source. On Linezolid, Meropenem, and caspofungin. Now CMV viremia.
   Line infection still possible. All old lines removed. Skin breakdown
   but unlikely source of infection. Treated with stress dose steroids
   despite neg [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim. BP fluctuates possible sepsis vs volume shifts.
   In setting of low albumin and 25 kg positive balance, this is
   distributive shock. [**Last Name (un) **] compartment syndrome ruled out with bladder
   pressure. Increase in wbc today but continues to be afeb though on
   steroids. F/u on all cultures. F/u with ID recs.
   2. Respiratory failure: not ready to wean. Will avoid sedation and wean
   vent as tolerated. Question of pulmonary hemorrhage but unlikely,
   negative serologies...
   3. Acute renal failure on HD - oliguric with severe volume overload and
   increasing FiO2 requirements. Baseline creat was ~ 1.6. Dialysed and
   ultrafiltrated yesterday. Plan is to hold on inserting new dialysis
   catheter for 2-3 days due to bacteremia. Will d/w renal about starting
   CVVH.
   4. AFib -  off dilt drip
   5. Anemia with ? GI Bleed - hct are stable. Hx of GI bleed in [**2127**],
   coffee grounds in OGT. Start tube feeds and watch hct.
   6. Lines - f/u on line tip culture (dialysis catheter tip sent). New
   PICC [**1-30**].
   7. Elevated troponins
 likely all demand ischemia. Pt is s/p MI [**2127**]
   with stent placement. EF=60-65% [**2130-1-2**], likely has some dCHF (rvsp
   41mmhg). Will start beta blocker. Not candidate for ASA yet.
   8. DM2 - on glargine insulin and SS. Follow FS closely while on
   steroids
   9. Thrombocytopenia - resolving, question of voriconazole as cause, hx
   of HIT but negative [**2130-1-27**]. no documented heparin at OSH, citrate with
   dialysis.
   10. hypothyroid -  TSH 11 with low fT4. Levothyroxine IV. Endocrine's
   input appreciated.
   11. Hx of RA, gout - no evidence of inflammatory joints presently, per
   family, not on any RA or gout medications.
   12. Skin breakdown - skin care
   13. Bilat pleural effusions - left effusion appears loculated
   14. Alk phos elvation - possible acalculous chole. RUQ ultrasound today

   # Hypotension
recurred this am, continues to require levo
   intermittently, etiology intravasc volume depletion s/p HD & sepsis
   with GPCs growing from blood & urine, primary source unclear.
   Infectious sources include VAP, skin ulcers & GI bleed, UTI, colitis,
   rectus sheath hematoma. Pt with mild transaminitis rising alk phos &
   LDH ? may be due to CMV viremia infiltrating liver vs occult
   malignancy.
   - continue broad spectrum ABx with now Day 4 Linezolid, Meropenem,
   Caspofungin & Flagyl, f/u ID recs
   - f/u culture tips, urine, blood, sputum cultures (GPCs from blood are
   VRE, sensitivity to linezolid & dapto pending)
   - f/u glucan/galactomannan
   - weaning hydrocortizone to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   - starting Gancyclovir dosed for CVVH today
   - TSH elev, free T4 & T3 low, continue Levothyroxine 100mcg po
   - RUQ u/s no evidence of cholecystitis
   # Hypoxia - Etiology of prolonged hypoxia likely due to PNA & massive
   volume overload, pt may now have additional VAP complicating pulm
   process.  Pt has h/o bloody clots on bronch concerning for
   pulmonary-renal syndromes  but ANCA/[**Doctor First Name 1205**] negative, anti GBM pending. Pt
   having difficulty oxygenating o/n, barriers are massive volume overload
   and possible VAP.  Will f/u am ABG after increasing FiO2.
   - f/u ABG & monitor sats, will continue to increase FiO2 if necessary
   - plan for CVVH today (this is most correctable barrier to oxygenation)
   - continue broad spectrum abx for presumed VAP- f/u ID recs
   - f/u induced sputum cx (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**])
   - surgery consulted for trach placement, waiting for pt to be less PEEP
   dependant
   .
   # GI - h/o GIB in [**2127**] & pt p/w coffee grounds in OGT, only on
   sucralfate at OSH while receiving high dose steroids for >4wks. High
   suspician of gastritis vs ulcer.  Today, OGT residuals have been clear.
   Etiology of elevated LFTs unclear, AP & LDH elevated, but T. Bili is
   WNL.  Transaminitis & Alk phos may be due to CMV virus, but unusual
   presentation.  Given new CMV viremia, will begin occult malignancy work
   up & HIV screen when consentable. HCT continues to be stable.
   - continue PPI iv bid & sucralfate.
   - maintain active T& S
   - RUQ U/S negative for acalculous cholecyst.
   - LFTs suggest diffuse liver process, unclear if this is due to CMV
   viremia, started on Gangcyclovir [**2-1**]
   - continue TF & monitor residuals
   .
   # ARF/CRI - currently in oliguric renal failure, requiring HD.
   Etiology unclear, baseline creatinine ~1.2 to 1.7 and suffered an
   insult during OSH course resulting in oliguric RF.  Differential
   includes ATN vs drug toxicity.  Pt with massive volume overload likely
   biggest correctable barrier to oxygenation.
   - renal consult,  for HD having issues with hypotension during
   dialysis, will likely need CVVH
   - f/u urine sediment with renal
   - Urine eos negative
   - renally dose meds.
   .
   # CV: Pt with CAD s/p stenting in [**2127**], ASA & Plavix held in setting of
   ?pulm hemorrhage. There was no evidence of ischemia on EKG, +trop
   likely [**12-24**] ARF. Pt developed afib during OSH adm in setting of
   pulmonary processes, rate relatively well controlled at present,
   90-110s but spikes up to 140s intermittently.  Pt massively volume
   overloaded, ECHO shows hyperdynamic LVEF of 70-80% & small cavity size,
   2+ TR & MR.
   - consulting renal, will likely need CVVH for fluid removal
   - monitor HR, continue Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ASA 81mg, continue to monitor hct [**Hospital1 **] given possible GI
   bleed
   #DM2
 At OSH, pt was on NPH 20 QAM, 5U QPM, then increased to levamir
   30U Q12H on [**12-9**] after started on decadron for reactive airways, most
   recently receiving 8U levamir QAM, with humalog SSI, with reasonably
   good FSBS recently (has had some hypoglycemic episodes).
   - 8U glargine QAM, and cover with HISS (BS running in 150 range)
   - check FSBS q2hr for now given steroids.
   - avoiding insulin gtt due large volume fluid load due to high insulin
   requiremts

   # HEME/ONC
 Pt with anemia thought [**12-24**] to CKD & profound
   thrombocytopenia noted on OSH with nadir of 20 000. Etiology unclear
   but attributed to infection vs med toxicity.  HITT negative at OSH.
   Plts stable in 100s.  Fibrinogen/LDH & haptoglobin elevated making
   hemolysis & DIC unlikely.  Elev LDH, CMV viremia concerning for lymph
   malignancy or other immunocomprom Dz.  Plan to review CT with radiology
   ?lymphadenopathy.  Will consent for HIV screen when alert.
   - f/u IgG panel, SPEP, UPEP, Flow cytometry
   - repeating HIT Ab
   - smear shows only occais schistocytes
   - type & screen active, continue ASA 81mg daily
   - guaic all stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric renal failure, now presenting with massive volume overload, VRE bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has recurrent hypotension requiring levo, unclear etiology, and ongoing broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. She also has an elevated TSH, free T4 & T3 low, and is on levothyroxine. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple conditions including pneumonia, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, coronary artery disease, and possible pulmonary-renal syndromes. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation, CVVH planned, and requires further evaluation for occult malignancy and HIV status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's recurrent hypotension may be due to intravascular volume depletion secondary to HD and sepsis with GPCs growing from blood and urine. It is crucial to monitor and manage her fluid balance carefully.
2. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. Treatment with linezolid and meropenem is ongoing. Close monitoring of her blood cultures and sensitivity patterns is necessary to adjust the antibiotic regimen if needed.
3. CMV Viremia: The patient has CMV viremia, for which she has been started on ganciclovir. Monitoring viral load and"

   79F h/o F transferred here after prolonged adm for hypoxic respiratory
   failure & oliguric renal failure, now with massive volume overload, VRE
   bacteremia & CMV viremia.
   # Hypotension
 pt has been intermittently hypotension over last 24hrs
   and has been requiring levo intermittently, etiology likely due to
   intravasc volume depletion s/p HD volume removal & sepsis with GPCs
   growing from blood, urine & RIJ cath tip, possibly the primary source.
    Other infectious sources include VAP, skin ulcers, UTI, colitis or
   rectus sheath hematoma. Pt with mild transaminitis and rising alk
   phos/LDH of unknown etiology.  AP/LDH elevation may also be due to CMV
   viremia infiltrating liver vs occult malignancy.  Pt getting CVVH for
   volume removal today.
   - continue broad spectrum ABx with now Day 4 Linezolid, Meropenem,
   Caspofungin & Flagyl, f/u ID recs

   # Hypoxia - Etiology of prolonged hypoxia likely due to PNA & massive
   volume overload, pt may now have additional VAP complicating pulm
   process.  Pt has h/o bloody clots on bronch concerning for
   pulmonary-renal syndromes  but ANCA/[**Doctor First Name 1205**] negative, anti GBM pending. Pt
   having difficulty oxygenating o/n, barriers are massive volume overload
   and possible VAP.  Will attempt to wean PEEP today after volume removal
   at CVVH.
   - f/u ABG & monitor sats, attempt to wean PEEP today
   - plan for CVVH today ( most correctable barrier to oxygenation)
   - continue broad spectrum abx for presumed VAP- f/u ID recs
   - f/u induced sputum cx (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**])
   - surgery consulted for trach placement, waiting for pt to be less PEEP
   dependant
   .
   # GI - h/o GIB in [**2127**] & pt p/w coffee grounds in OGT, only on
   sucralfate at OSH while receiving high dose steroids for >4wks. High
   suspician of gastritis vs ulcer. Tolerating TFs now on PPI [**Hospital1 **].
   Etiology of elev AP & LDH unclear but T. Bili is WNL.  Transaminitis &
   Alk phos may be due to CMV virus, but unusual presentation.  Given new
   CMV viremia, will begin occult malignancy work up, getting an AFP
   today. HIV screen when consentable. HCT continues to be stable.
   - continue PPI iv bid & sucralfate.
   - maintain active T& S, guaic all stools
   - RUQ U/S negative for cholecystitis
   - LFTs suggest diffuse liver process, unclear if this is due to CMV
   viremia, started on Gangcyclovir [**2-1**]
   - continue TF & monitor residuals
   - f/u AFP
   .
   # ARF/CRI - currently in oliguric renal failure, requiring HD.
   Etiology unclear, baseline creatinine ~1.2 to 1.7 and suffered an
   insult during OSH course resulting in oliguric RF.  Differential
   includes ATN vs drug toxicity.  Pt with massive volume overload likely
   biggest correctable barrier to oxygenation.
   - renal consult,  plan for CVVH
   - f/u urine sediment with renal
   - will review meds today and adjust for CVVH
   .
   # HEME/ONC
 Pt with anemia thought [**12-24**] to CKD & profound
   thrombocytopenia noted on OSH with nadir of 20 000. Etiology unclear
   but attributed to infection vs med toxicity.  HITT negative at OSH.
   Plts stable in 100s now. Fibrinogen trended down throughout yesterday.
   Elev LDH, CMV viremia concerning for lymph malignancy or other
   immunocomprom disease. Will consent for HIV screen when alert.  No
   lymphadenopathy seen on CT & IgM mildly elevated, otherwise IgG panel
   WNL
   - f/u SPEP, Flow cytometry & AFP
   - smear shows only occais schistocytes
   - type & screen active, continue ASA 81mg daily
   # CV: Pt with CAD s/p stenting in [**2127**], ASA & Plavix held in setting of
   pulm hemorrhage. There was no evidence of ischemia on EKG, +trop likely
   [**12-24**] ARF. Pt developed Afib during OSH adm in setting of pulmonary
   processes, currently  massively volume overloaded, ECHO shows
   hyperdynamic LVEF of 70-80% & small cavity size, 2+ TR & MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 1569**]
   BB currently due to intermittent hypotension and pressor requirement.
   Will start back BB for HR control once BP stabilized.
   - CVVH for fluid removal
   - monitor HR, start Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] when BP can tolerate
   - continue ASA 81mg, continue to monitor hct [**Hospital1 **] given possible GI
   bleed
   #DM2
 Decent BS control on current regimen
   - continue 8U glargine QAM, and cover with HISS (BS running in 150
   range)
   - check FSBS q2hr for now given recent steroid use

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric renal failure. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, requiring intermittent administration of levothyroxine. The patient also has a VRE bacteremia and CMV viremia.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by hypoxia, which is likely due to pneumonia and massive volume overload. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well. The patient has difficulty oxygenating and has been placed on non-invasive ventilation support.

The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) system is showing signs of gastritis or ulcer, possibly due to high-dose steroids and sucralfate. The patient is tolerating tube feedings and has been started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The patient's renal function is impaired, with oliguric renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The etiology of the renal failure is unclear, but it could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or drug toxicity. The patient has massive volume overload, which is likely the biggest correctable barrier to oxygenation.

The patient's hematological profile shows anemia and thrombocytopenia, but these have stabilized in the past few days. There is a concern for lymph malignancy or other immunocompromised diseases, especially with the presence of CMV viremia. A"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yr old woman VRE sepsis, CMV viremia
   1. VRE sepsis / CMV viremia / other ID issues: likely from line vs
   urinary source, line tip and urine growing VRE.
   On Linezolid, Meropenem, and caspofungin, gancyclovir. Now CMV
   viremia.  Old lines removed.
   Skin breakdown but unlikely source of infection. Treated with stress
   dose steroids despite neg [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim.
   Hypotension: improved.  BP fluctuates possible sepsis vs volume shifts.
   In setting of low albumin and 25 kg positive balance, this is likley
   distributive shock. [**Last Name (un) **] compartment syndrome ruled out with bladder
   pressure. Increase in wbc today but continues to be afeb though on
   steroids. F/u on all cultures. F/u with ID recs. Taper steroids.
   2. Respiratory failure: not ready to wean. Now being sedated for
   apparent vent dyssynchrony. Lighten up sedation and wean as tolerated
   once more negative.
   3. Acute renal failure, anuria - severe volume overload and increasing
   FiO2 requirements, will likely benefit from CVVH. Baseline creat was ~
   1.6. Dialysed and ultrafiltrated to negative balance. Appreciate
   renal's input. CVVH to be started today.
   4. AFib -  off dilt drip
   5. Anemia with ? GI Bleed - hct are stable. Hx of GI bleed in [**2127**],
   coffee grounds in OGT. Start tube feeds and watch hct.
   6. Lines - f/u on line tip culture (dialysis catheter tip sent). New
   PICC [**1-30**].
   7. Elevated troponins
 likely all demand ischemia. Pt is s/p MI [**2127**]
   with stent placement. EF=60-65% [**2130-1-2**], likely has some dCHF (rvsp
   41mmhg). Will start beta blocker. Not candidate for ASA yet.
   8. DM2 - on glargine insulin and SS. Follow FS closely while on
   steroids
   9. Thrombocytopenia - improved, question of voriconazole as cause, hx
   of HIT but negative [**2130-1-27**]. no documented heparin at OSH, citrate with
   dialysis.
   10. hypothyroid -  TSH 11 with low fT4. Levothyroxine IV. Endocrine's
   input appreciated.
   11. Hx of RA, gout - no evidence of inflammatory joints presently, per
   family, not on any RA or gout medications.
   12. Skin breakdown - skin care
   13. Bilat pleural effusions - left effusion appears loculated
   14. Alk phos elvation - possible acalculous chole. RUQ ultrasound today

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of multiple medical conditions, including VRE sepsis, CMV viremia, acute renal failure, anemia, AFib, lines, elevated troponins, diabetes mellitus type 2, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, RA, gout, skin breakdown, and bilateral pleural effusions. She is currently critically ill and on various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VRE sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with VRE (Vancomycin-resistant enterococci) sepsis. This condition can lead to further infection and systemic complications if not properly managed.
2. CMV viremia: The patient is experiencing CMV (Cytomegalovirus) viremia, indicating an active viral infection. If left untreated, it can progress to CMV disease, which can be severe and life-threatening.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, which may worsen if not promptly addressed. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored, especially considering the history of GI bleed. Further investigation and management are required to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
5. AFib: The patient has AFib (Atrial Fibrillation), which increases the risk of clot formation and potential complications such as stroke. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.
6. Lines: The presence of multiple lines increases the risk of infection. Regular monitoring and appropriate management of line-associated complications are crucial.
7. Elevated troponins: The elevated troponin levels suggest possible cardiac ischemia or damage. Further evaluation and management are required to assess the extent of cardiac involvement and provide appropriate treatment.
8. DM2: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 needs to be closely managed, particularly during the period of critical illness and steroid use, which can affect glucose control.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count should be monitored, and the cause needs to be identified and treated accordingly.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism requires treatment with levothyroxine, and close monitoring of thyroid function is essential.
11. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown needs to be managed appropriately to prevent further complications such as infection.
12. Bilateral pleural effusions: The presence of bilateral pleural effusions requires evaluation and management to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, ARDS, oliguric renal failure, massive volume overload, [Month/Year] bacteremia & CMV viremia. She is currently experiencing hypoxia due to ARDS and volume overload, and there may be an additional risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), although the chest X-ray does not show any new infiltrates. The patient has been on CVVH for volume removal and broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Linezolid, Meropenem, Caspofungin, and Flagyl. She also has gastritis, which was confirmed by EGD, and her liver enzymes are elevated, with transaminitis and alkaline phosphatase. There is a suspicion of diffuse liver process, possibly due to CMV virus, but further investigation is needed. The patient is in oliguric renal failure and requires CVVH. The cause of renal failure is unclear, with possibilities including acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or drug toxicity. The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a positive HITT antibody, suggesting a possible diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's cardiovascular status includes a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with stenting in 2006, and she is currently in atrial fibrillation with ongoing hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric renal failure. She was admitted to the ICU for massive volume overload, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. The patient continues to be intermittently hypotensive and requires vasoactive support. She also experiences hypoxia, likely due to pneumonia and massive volume overload. The patient has gastritis without acute bleeding and has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding in the past. Her alkaline phosphatase and LDH levels are elevated, but the cause is unclear. She is in oliguric renal failure and requires hemodialysis. The patient has a history of cancer, but the current status is unclear. She has thrombocytopenia, which is now stable. The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and is in atrial fibrillation. Her blood glucose levels are being monitored closely due to recent steroid use. She also has hypothyroidism. The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown. Her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's intermittent hypotension may be due to intravascular volume depletion and sepsis. Other potential sources of infection include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), skin ulcers, urinary tract infection (UTI), colitis, or rectus sheath hematoma.

2. Hypoxia: The patient"

   Sepsis/ hypotension: improving but still requiring low dose levophed.
   Sedation and CVVH playing some role. Leukocytosis somewhat improved,
   afebrile. F/u on all cultures. Appreciate ID recs. Can d/c
   hydrocortisone.
   2. Respiratory failure: not ready to wean. Being sedated for apparent
   vent dyssynchrony. Wean as tolerated once more negative.
   3. Acute renal failure, anuria - severe volume overload and increased
   FiO2 requirements, on CVVH. Baseline creat was ~ 1.6. Dialysed and
   ultrafiltrated. Appreciate renal's input.
   4. AFib -  off dilt drip
   5. Anemia with ? GI Bleed - hct are stable. Hx of GI bleed in [**2127**],
   coffee grounds in OGT. Start tube feeds and watch hct. On PPI and
   sucralfate.
   6. Lines - Old [**Year (4 digits) 1591**] infected line is out. New PICC [**1-30**].
   Other issues
    Elevated troponins
 likely all demand ischemia. Pt is s/p MI [**2127**]
   with stent placement. EF=60-65% [**2130-1-2**], likely has some dCHF (rvsp
   41mmhg). Will start beta blocker. Not candidate for ASA yet.
    DM2 - on glargine insulin and SS. Follow FS closely while on steroids
    Thrombocytopenia - improved, question of voriconazole as cause, hx of
   HIT but negative [**2130-1-27**]. no documented heparin at OSH, citrate with
   dialysis.
    hypothyroid -  TSH 11 with low fT4. Levothyroxine IV. Endocrine's
   input appreciated.
    Hx of RA, gout - no evidence of inflammatory joints presently, per
   family, not on any RA or gout medications.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Sepsis/CMV viremia: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis and CMV viremia. These conditions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is not ready to wean off the ventilator due to apparent vent dyssynchrony. This indicates that the patient's respiratory function is compromised and may require further intervention.

3. Acute renal failure, anuria: The patient has severe volume overload and increased FiO2 requirements, indicating renal dysfunction. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated to manage this condition.

4. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has an irregular heart rhythm, which can increase the risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular complications.

5. Anemia with possible GI bleed: The patient's Hct levels are stable, but there is a history of GI bleed. Monitoring the patient's hct levels and providing appropriate treatment for any ongoing bleeding is important.

6. Lines - infected line removal: An infected line has been removed, and a new PICC line has been inserted. Monitoring for any signs of infection at the new line site is necessary.

7. Elevated troponins: The patient has elevated troponin levels, suggesting possible myocardial ischemia or injury. Further evaluation and management of cardiac"

   No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are complex, nonmobile
   (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets and chorda tendinae are mildly thickened with a
   characteristic rheumatic deformity of the valve. The posterior mitral
   leaflet is thickened and largely immobilized. There is, however, no
   mitral stenosis. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
   Mild-to-moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no vegetation of the
   tricuspid valve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, massive volume overload, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She is currently in the ICU with ongoing hypoxia, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated alkaline phosphatase and LDH levels, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and skin breakdown. She is on multiple medications and has various lines and catheters in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing prolonged hypoxia due to ARDS and volume overload. Additional barriers to oxygenation include massive volume overload and underlying ARDS.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be intermittently hypotensive, requiring only minimal amounts of levo. The etiology is more likely due to intravascular volume depletion with CVVH.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and confirmed gastritis during an EGD, but no acute bleed is currently observed.
4. Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase and LDH: The etiology of elevated AP and LDH is unclear, but transaminitis and LDH may be due to CMV virus. Occult malignancy workup has been negative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure/ARDS, oliguric renal failure, massive volume overload, and bacteremia & CMV viremia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 14 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax 36.9°C, Tcurrent 36.8°C, HR 106 bpm (84-116 bpm), BP 100/43 mmHg (60-132/70-88 mmHg), RR 24 inspirations per minute (6-27), and SpO2 100%. She has a history of atrial fibrillation.

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has a history of respiratory failure and ARDS, which is contributing to her prolonged hypoxia. The current etiology of hypoxia includes massive volume overload and underlying ARDS. There are no new infiltrates on chest X-ray, and sputum cultures are negative.
2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient is in oliguric renal failure, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for volume removal. The etiology of renal failure is unclear, with differentials including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), drug toxicity, and renal papillary necrosis.

   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are complex, nonmobile
   (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets and chorda tendinae are mildly thickened with a
   characteristic rheumatic deformity of the valve. The posterior mitral
   leaflet is thickened and largely immobilized. There is, however, no
   mitral stenosis. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
   Mild-to-moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no vegetation of the
   tricuspid valve.
   IMPRESSION: No endocarditis. Mild rheumatic valvular disease. Complex
   and extensive aortic atheroma.
   [**2-3**] Portable:
   The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  The right PICC line tip is

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure. She has had a long hospital course, including intubation, multiple infectious complications, and sepsis caused by an enterococcal line infection. The patient now presents with possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), CMV bacteremia, and is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). She requires intermittent use of levophed while on CVVH. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. She is on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 224, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) value of 10.3 L/min. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and an elevated white blood cell count. Laboratory results show renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has a DNR code status and is critically ill.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), admitted to the hospital 1.5 months ago. She presented with respiratory failure and has had a long hospital course characterized by intubation, multiple infectious complications, septicemia from an enterococcal line infection, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with new right lower lobe consolidation and gram-positive cocci in sputum, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) bacteremia. She is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and requiring intermittent use of levophed.

24-hour events include a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing no evidence of vegetation, discontinuation of steroids, and intermittent requirement of levophed while on CVVH.

The patient has multiple allergies to heparin agents, succinylcholine, and unknown substances. She has received various antibiotics and antiviral medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and other assessments not documented.

Lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose, prothrombin time/international normalized"

She is currently in the ICU for hypoxia, which is resolving but still requires oxygenation support. The etiology of her prolonged hypoxia is thought to be ARDS and volume overload. Despite previous antibiotic treatment, sputum cultures have not grown any organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is still requiring oxygenation support, indicating that her hypoxia is not completely resolved. This may be due to ongoing ARDS and volume overload.
2. Skin Breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which can lead to pressure ulcers and infections.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is in oliguric renal failure, requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) for volume removal and support of her kidneys.
4. Infection: The patient has bacteremia and CMV viremia, indicating an ongoing infection. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Linezolid, Meropenem, Caspofungin, Flagyl) and antiviral medication (Gancyclovir).
5. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient continues to be intermittently hypotensive, requiring minimal amounts of levothyroxine. The etiology of her hypotension is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, massive volume overload, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has been in the ICU for several days and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Linezolid, PO Vancomycin, and Meropenem. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still requiring some support with norepinephrine for blood pressure maintenance. She has been weaned off some ventilator settings and is oxygenating well.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive, requiring only minimal amounts of levothyroxine. The etiology of the hypotension is more likely due to intravascular volume depletion with CVVH.
2. GI issues: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and gastritis. She is producing bloody oral secretions and guaiac-positive stools. Her hematocrit dropped overnight, and she is being monitored for any signs of significant blood loss.
3. Renal failure: The patient is currently in oliguric renal failure and requires CVVH for fluid removal. The etiology of the renal failure is unclear, with differentials including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), drug toxicity, and renal papillary necrosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, massive volume overload, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia resolving, ARDS, skin breakdown on the tongue, and potential need for tracheostomy. She is also experiencing hypotension, possible drug-induced liver injury, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Other issues include gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated liver enzymes, acute renal failure, and potential endocrine disorders. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and ARDS puts her at risk for continued respiratory distress and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure requires ongoing management, including CVVH for fluid removal and addressing the underlying causes of renal dysfunction.
3. Massive Volume Overload: The patient's massive volume overload is a significant concern and may contribute to ongoing hypoxia and respiratory difficulties. Continued efforts to remove excess fluid through CVVH and diuresis are necessary.
4. Bacteremia and CMV Viremia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with extended respiratory failure, renal failure on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), VRE bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has been sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been weaned to a PEEP of 8 and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 123/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has a history of allergies to heparin agents and succinylcholine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. A sputum culture is pending to confirm the presence of a new infection.
2. Infectious complications: The patient has VRE bacteremia and CMV viremia. These infections require ongoing treatment with appropriate antibiotics and antiviral medications.
3. Renal failure: The patient is on CVVH for renal failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate if she develops further complications or if her underlying condition worsens.
5. Bloodstream infection: The presence of bloody oral secret"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with extended respiratory failure, renal failure on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) bacteremia, and CMV (cytomegalovirus) viremia. She is currently sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has been weaned to a PEEP of 8 and is on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 123/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is unresponsive and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for new infiltrates on chest X-ray and implement appropriate infection control measures.
2. Line-associated bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, PICC line, and dialysis catheter. Regular monitoring for signs of infection and prompt removal of unnecessary lines are crucial to prevent line-associated bloodstream infections.
3. Catheter-related urinary tract infection: Given the duration of urinary catheterization, there is a risk of developing a catheter-related urinary tract infection. Daily assessment of urinary symptoms and urinalysis should be performed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure/ARDS, oliguric renal failure, massive volume overload, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. The patient's current medical complications include hypoxia, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated alkaline phosphatase and LDH levels, acute renal failure with ongoing oliguria, and potential hematological abnormalities.

The patient's hypoxia is resolving, with a recent weaning to PEEP of 8. The etiology of the prolonged hypoxia is thought to be due to ARDS and volume overload. Sputum cultures have been negative despite bacteremia. The patient's hypotension is intermittent and likely due to intravascular volume depletion with CVVH. Cultures have been negative since January 31st.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding in December 2027 and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on February 1st confirmed gastritis. The patient is producing bloody oral secretions and has guaiac-positive stools. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped overnight, but there is no acute indication for transfusion.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase and LDH levels are of unclear etiology, but may be due to CMV virus or renal papillary necrosis. The patient's peripheral smear shows many immature cells, and flow cytometry is pending. The patient is currently in oliguric renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with extended respiratory failure, renal failure on CVVH, VRE bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has leukocytosis and remains pressor dependent intermittently. There is a suspicion of empyema due to small but complicated appearing pleural effusions. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for new infiltrates on chest X-ray and sputum cultures will be important to detect early signs of infection.
2. Renal failure: The patient is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) to manage renal failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and urine output is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment.
3. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. There is a risk of progression to sepsis, so ongoing surveillance and prompt treatment are essential.
4. Empyema: The presence of small but complicated appearing pleural effusions raises concern for empyema"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). She is currently in the ICU (intensive care unit) and has been diagnosed with oliguric renal failure, requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) for volume removal. The patient also has a history of bacteremia and CMV (cytomegalovirus) viremia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support. The patient is also experiencing intermittent hypotension requiring minimal amounts of levothyroxine.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos). The patient's blood cultures have been negative since January 31st, and her sputum culture is also negative. Imaging studies reveal widespread ground-glass opacities with dependent consolidation consistent with ARDS, as well as septal thickening and pleural effusions suggestive of superimposed hydrostatic edema.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxia, hypotension, gastrointestinal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure/ARDS, oliguric renal failure on CVVH for volume removal, bacteremia & CMV viremia. She has been weaned off mechanical ventilation and is now on low levels of PEEP. The patient remains pressor-dependent and continues to undergo CVVH for volume removal. Her cultures have been negative since January 31st, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has hypotension, which is thought to be due to intravascular volume depletion with CVVH. She has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and gastritis, and her electrolyte levels are abnormal. The patient is in oliguric renal failure and requires CVVH. There are concerns about possible malignancy, and further investigations are needed. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has widespread ground-glass opacities with dependent consolidation, consistent with ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia, and despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a risk of ongoing sepsis. Sepsis can cause hypotension, organ dysfunction, and multiple organ failure.
3. Renal Failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure and ARDS, oliguric renal failure, bacteremia and CMV viremia. She has been on CVVH for volume removal and remains pressor-dependent. The patient's hypoxia is resolving, but she still requires a PEEP of 5. She has been weaned off some of the ventilator support. 

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and gastritis, and her oral secretions have improved. She is planned for a tracheostomy placement today. Her HCT is stable, and she has been transfused to maintain a goal HCT of >23. 

The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase levels. The cause of these abnormalities is unclear. She also has an elevated AFP, which may indicate occult malignancy. 

The patient is in oliguric renal failure and requires CVVH. The etiology of her renal failure is unknown, with possible causes including ATN, drug toxicity, and renal papillary necrosis. 

The patient has a history of cancer and is showing signs of immature cells on her peripheral smear, suggesting possible MDS. Flow cytometry shows lymphoid predominance, and there are no signs of B-cell lymphoma. 

The patient's cardiovascular status includes a history of CAD and atrial fibrillation. She requires low-dose levothyroid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, ARDS, oliguric renal failure, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on CVVH for volume removal and pressor dependent due to hypotension. The patient's hypoxia is resolving, and she has been weaned off PEEP. Imaging shows widespread ground-glass opacities and dependent consolidation consistent with ARDS. The patient has a history of GIB and confirmed gastritis. She is producing bloody oral secretions, and her hct is stable. The patient has an elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase, with an unclear etiology. She also has evidence of renal papillary necrosis and peripheral smear showing many immature cells. The patient is in oliguric renal failure, requiring CVVH, and the etiology is unclear. She has a history of HIT Ab+ from OSH, and her peripheral smear shows many immature cells, possible c/w MDS. The patient's cardiovascular system includes CAD s/p stenting in 06, ASA held in setting of pulmonary hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with hypotension requiring low-dose levophed with CVVH. The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, though no frank ulcers. She has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and is being treated with insulin, glargine, and levothyroxine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's imaging shows widespread ground-glass opacities and dependent consolidation consistent with ARDS. This can lead to severe respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) exacerbation.

2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient is in oliguric renal failure, requiring CVVH for volume removal. This condition can progress to anuria or severe oliguria, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

3. CMV Viremia: The patient has a history of CMV viremia and is currently on gancyclovir treatment. If the infection persists or worsens, it can lead to further immunosuppression and increased risk of other infections.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and confirmed gastritis. She is producing bloody oral secretions, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to anemia, hypotension, and increased risk of infection.

5. MDS/Leukemia: The patient's peripheral smear shows many immature cells, which may indicate myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the exact diagnosis and potential complications.

6. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive requiring low-dose lev"

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with extended respiratory failure, renal failure on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) bacteremia, and CMV (cytomegalovirus) viremia. The patient has acute respiratory failure with ongoing volume overload but is tolerating CVVH with negative daily balances. There are bibasilar infiltrates with small effusions on CT, and oxygenation (PEEP and FiO2) is improving with CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, and bacteremia secondary to line sepsis. She has been on CVVH for volume removal and remains pressor-dependent. The patient has been weaned off PEEP and is tolerating it well. Imaging shows ground glass opacities and dependent consolidation consistent with ARDS. She underwent tracheostomy without complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient had sputum cultures positive for VAP. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for improvement.
2. Line sepsis: The patient had bacteremia believed to be secondary to line sepsis. Cultures from NG tube were negative since January 31st, and she is currently on Linezolid.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is oliguric and requires CVVH for volume removal. The etiology of AKI is unclear but may include ATN, drug toxicity, or renal papillary necrosis.
4. Colitis: CT scan showed colitis, which could be a result of Clostridioides difficile infection (C. diff), especially considering the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and negative C. diff tests.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has been on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with extended respiratory failure, renal failure on CVVH,
   VRE bacteremia, CMV viremia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure s/p trach [**2-7**]: significant improvement,
   now on trach collar. Ongoing volume overload, tolerating CVVH with
   negative balances. Bibasilar infiltrates with small effusions on CT.
   Continues on linezolid/flagyl. Off meropenem.
   2. Leukocytosis - remains pressor dependent intermittently. c diff neg
   x4, empirically being treated - off PO vanc and meropenem. CMV and VRE
   bacteremia, on treatment. Complicated appearing pleural effusions,
   possibility of empyema but small and likely due to volume overload in
   setting of hypoalbuminemia.
   3. Sepsis / VRE bacteremia: Cont linezolid ([**7-6**])
   4. CMV viremia: cont ganciclovir - no evidence of immunocompromise
   5. Leukocytosis but slightly improved. [**2-6**] diff showed 20% bands and
   immature cells.
   6. Afib with RVR - on amio, suboptimal rate control
   7. Oliguric renal failure: cont CVVH.
   8. Elevated alk phos:  no clear etiology
   9. Possible hematologic malignancy vs MDS - will involve hematology for
   BM bx though not urgent.
   10. Hypothyroidism: on IV levothyroxine

- The patient was intubated on 02/07 and tracheostomy performed on 02/08.
- The patient has been weaned off pressors and is now maintaining stable blood pressure.
- The patient's hypoxia is resolving, but there is a concern for lung derecruitment.
- The patient's WBC count has been rising since stopping PO Vanc, so a C. diff test will be sent.
- The patient's renal function is improving, and CVVH will continue for volume removal.
- The patient's CMV viral load is decreasing, but she remains on Gancyclovir.
- The patient's line cultures have been negative since 01/31, and she will continue on Day 9 of Abx Linezolid.
- The patient's ARF/CRI is oliguric renal failure, with unclear etiology, possibly ATN or drug toxicity.
- The patient's GI symptoms include gastritis and possible GIB in 06. She has a planned peg placement.
- The patient's elevated Alk Phos/LDH levels are unclear, possibly due to CMV or occult malignancy.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure/ARDS, oliguric renal failure on CVVH, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but experienced prolonged hypoxia, which resolved after being weaned to CPAP. The etiology of the prolonged hypoxia was thought to be ARDS and volume overload. A CT scan showed ground glass opacities and dependent consolidation consistent with ARDS. The patient continues to tolerate CPAP well and is being weaned progressively with ongoing volume removal.

The patient has been positive for bacteremia due to [Month/Year (2) 1591], believed to be secondary to line sepsis. She underwent tracheostomy on [2-7] and has shown improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxemia, hypotension, heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic), and renal failure (acute). The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but was successfully weaned off tracheostomy collar with the help of CPAP and showed improved ABG. The patient has a history of unknown allergies to heparin agents and succinylcholine. He has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, gancyclovir, and linezolid.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 120 bpm (with a range of 107-129 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 128/54 mmHg to 155/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (with a range of 18-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 7,506 mL and a total output of 10,733 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,227 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 645 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of"

   didn't tolerate TC yesterday but this will problably improve with
   ongoing volume removal.
   Bibasilar infiltrates with small effusions on CT.
   2. Leukocytosis - remains pressor dependent intermittently. c diff neg
   x4, empirically being treated - off PO vanc and meropenem. CMV and VRE
   bacteremia, on treatment. Complicated appearing pleural effusions,
   possibility of empyema but small and likely due to volume overload in
   setting of hypoalbuminemia.
   3. Sepsis / VRE bacteremia: Cont linezolid ([**8-6**])
   4. CMV viremia: cont ganciclovir - no evidence of immunocompromise.
   Recheck viral load
   5. Leukocytosis: [**2-6**] diff showed 20% bands and immature cells.
   6. Afib with RVR - on amio, suboptimal rate control on amio 400mg TID
   7. Anuric renal failure: Tolerating CVVH with negative balances but
   agree with renal's plan to transition back to HD.
   8. Elevated alk phos:  no clear etiology
   9. Possible hematologic malignancy vs MDS - will involve hematology
   with this question.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with extended respiratory failure, renal failure on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) bacteremia, and CMV (cytomegalovirus) viremia. She has been treated with antibiotics for both infections. The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis, sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anuria renal failure, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and possible hematologic malignancy or myelodysplastic syndrome. She is being treated with multiple medications, including antivirals, antibiotics, and medications for other conditions such as hypothyroidism and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is not able to tolerate tracheostomy or if there is a recurrence of desaturation episodes.
2. VRE bacteremia: There is a risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic resistance with ongoing VRE infection.
3. CMV viremia: The patient's CMV infection may progress despite antiviral therapy.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If left untreated, it could lead to further complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient's septic condition could deteriorate if the current treatment"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, ARDS, oliguric renal failure, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on CVVH for volume removal. She has been treated with antibiotics for line sepsis and is now on Day 11 of abx with negative cultures since January 31st. Her hypotension is resolving, and she is off pressors. The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, and her Hct has trended down to 23.5. Her electrolytes are imbalanced, with low calcium and phosphate levels. She has a history of CAD, atrial fibrillation, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. Her CVVH will continue for fluid removal, and she will likely transition to HD over the weekend. Other issues include an elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase, possible occult malignancy, and anemia. The patient's current medications include lopressor, linezolid, gancyclovir, levothyroxine, and insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure and ARDS, which can lead to hypoxia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Renal failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function."

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status, with successful weaning from the ventilator and tolerance of a tracheostomy collar for over 24 hours. However, she still requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for volume removal and is planned to be transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) over the weekend.

The patient's blood cultures from January 29th have grown bacteria sensitive to Linezolid, and she has been on antibiotic therapy for 11 days. Her WBC count remains elevated, but all infectious workup has been negative since January 31st. A CT scan showed continued colitis, and she is negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is off pressors for over 48 hours. Blood cultures from January 29th have grown bacteria sensitive to Linezolid, and she has been on antibiotic therapy for 11 days. Her blood pressure is now well-controlled, and she is off pressors. The etiology of her acute kidney injury (AKI) is unclear, with differential diagnoses including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), drug toxicity, and renal papillary necrosis. She will continue CVVH for now,"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with extended hospital stay at OSH transferred for ongoing
   respiratory failure, renal failure, volume overload, VRE bacteremia,
   CMV viremia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure s/p trach [**2-7**], significant improvement:
   tolerating TC. Bibasilar infiltrates with small effusions on CT.
   2. Leukocytosis - c diff neg x 4, off PO vanc. Off meropenem. CMV and
   VRE bacteremia, on treatment.
   Complicated appearing pleural effusions but small and likely due to
   volume overload in setting of hypoalbuminemia.
   3. Sepsis / VRE bacteremia: cont linezolid ([**10-6**])
   4. CMV viremia: cont ganciclovir - no apparent evidence of
   immunocompromise. Recheck viral load. Heme consult appreciated. Likely
   a 3 wk course. Day 9
   5. Leukocytosis: [**2-6**] diff showed 20% bands and immature cells.
   6. Afib with RVR - on amio, better rate control with addition of
   metoprolol and reducing fluid removal. Agree, we can d/c amio and
   titrate up the beta blocker.
   7. Anuric renal failure: Tolerating CVVH with negative balances but
   agree with renal's plan to transition back to HD on Monday.
   8. Elevated alk phos:  no clear etiology
   9. Possible hematologic malignancy vs MDS - will involve hematology
   with this question.
   10. Hypothyroidism: on IV levothyroxine
   11. FEN - PEG to be placed early next week

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. She has been admitted to the ICU for ongoing respiratory failure, renal failure, volume overload, VRE bacteremia, and CMV viremia. 

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient had a tracheostomy (trach) and is showing significant improvement, tolerating tube feeding. There are bibasilar infiltrates with small effusions on the CT scan, which could be due to volume overload in the setting of hypoalbuminemia.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, but Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been negative four times. She is off PO vancomycin and meropenem. The patient is being treated for CMV and VRE bacteremia.

3. Sepsis/VRE bacteremia: The patient is continuing with linezolid, an antibiotic.

4. CMV viremia: The patient is continuing with ganciclovir treatment. There is no apparent evidence of immunocompromise, and it is suggested to recheck the viral load. A heme consult is appreciated, and it is likely a 3-week course.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's differential showed 20% bands and immature cells.

6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR): The patient is on amiodarone"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has undergone various interventions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 113/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy collar. The patient is still on mechanical ventilation but has been successfully weaned to the tracheostomy collar for over 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as decreased platelet count, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient also has elevated levels of liver enzymes (ALT/AST), amylase, lipase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The patient's medical complications include hypoxia, which is resolving due to ARDS and volume overload. The patient has been successfully weaned off the ventilator and is tolerating the tracheostomy collar well. There is a concern for line sepsis, and blood and sputum cultures have been sent.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is resolving. Blood cultures have been negative since January"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has undergone tracheostomy and is currently tolerating the tracheostomy collar well. The patient's hypoxia is resolving, and she has been successfully weaned off the ventilator. Her blood cultures are negative, indicating no current infection.

The patient's hypotension is also resolving, and she has been taken off the pressors for over 48 hours. Her renal function is improving, with improved blood pressures and decreased reliance on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) for fluid removal. However, the etiology of her oliguric renal failure remains unclear.

The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and chronic disease. She has been started on epoetin for anemia management. Her electrolyte imbalances, particularly low calcium and phosphorus levels, need to be aggressively corrected. The patient's cardiac condition includes atrial fibrillation with better control after adding low-dose beta-blockers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Despite negative blood cultures, there is a possibility of developing a new infection due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive lines.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further if the underlying cause of oliguric renal failure is not identified"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo woman with extended hospital stay at OSH transferred for ongoing
   respiratory failure, renal failure, volume overload, VRE bacteremia,
   CMV viremia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure s/p trach on [**2-7**] with significant
   improvement: now tolerating TC but ongoing O2 needs.
   Bibasilar infiltrates with small effusions on CT.  [**Month (only) 60**] need trach
   change to cuffless, fenestrated to allow for PMV, etc.
   2. Leukocytosis - improving.
   Other ID issues: c diff neg x 4, off PO vanc. Off meropenem. CMV and
   VRE bacteremia, on treatment.
   Complicated appearing pleural effusions but small and likely due to
   volume overload in setting of hypoalbuminemia.
   3. Sepsis / VRE bacteremia: cont linezolid (day [**11-5**])
   4. CMV viremia: cont ganciclovir - no apparent evidence of
   immunocompromise. Recheck viral load. Heme consult appreciated. Likely
   a 3 wk course. Day [**9-12**]
   5. Afib with RVR - suboptimal rate control on metoprolol and reducing
   fluid removal. Off amio.
   6. Anuric renal failure: Tolerating CVVH with negative balances but
   agree with renal's plan to transition back to HD on Monday.
   7. Elevated alk phos:  no clear etiology
   8. Possible hematologic malignancy vs MDS - appreciate hematology
   consult. LAP pending. [**Month (only) 60**] been bone marrow bx.
   9. Hypothyroidism: on IV levothyroxine, will switch to PO
   10. FEN - PEG to be placed early next week
   11. Anemia - likely due to chronic disease, phlebotomies, mild
   gastritis. Agree with transfusion to keep Hct >21

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure - the patient's ongoing need for supplemental oxygen indicates ongoing respiratory compromise.
2. Renal failure - the patient is anuric (not producing urine) and requires hemodialysis.
3. Volume overload - the patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating potential fluid overload.
4. VRE bacteremia - the patient has an ongoing infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
5. CMV viremia - the patient has an ongoing infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV).
6. Complicated pleural effusions - the patient has effusions that appear complicated and may require further evaluation and management.
7. Anemia - the patient has anemia that is likely due to chronic disease, phlebotomies, and mild gastritis.
8. Possible hematologic malignancy -"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypoxia, oliguric renal failure, and bacteremia. She is currently on tracheostomy collar and has been successfully weaned for over 48 hours. Her fluid overload has been managed with CVVH, but it will not be restarted. The plan is to transition to hemodialysis (HD) on Monday.

The patient's blood cultures from January 29th grew [First Name9 (NamePattern2) 1591] [Last Name (un) **] to Linezolid, but repeat cultures are negative since January 31st. She continues to have low-grade temperature and increased thick secretions. Her CT scan showed continued colitis, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is negative. She has also had a positive CMV viremia.

The patient's hypotension is resolving, and she has been off pressors for 72 hours. Her blood cultures from January 29th grew [First Name9 (NamePattern2) 1591] [Last Name (un) **] to Linezolid, but repeat cultures are negative since January 31st. Her CT scan showed continued colitis, and C. diff is negative. She has also had a positive CMV viremia.

   day 12 of Abx and repeat cultures negative since [**1-31**]. CT scan showed
   continued colitis. Cdiff neg x 5 now, WBC ct trended down.  No notable
   temperature.  Had restarted low dose levo.
   - will continue on levo, with goal for today to taper off.  Imagine as
   fluid collects w/o CVVH will not be as necessary
   - will reassess  ability to tolerate HD tomorrow.
   - unclear reason for new hypotension, no evidence of new infection
   - would change out PICC line if recurrent fever

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of femoral neck fracture and respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for volume removal due to oliguric renal failure and bacteremia caused by [**Month/Year (2) 1591**] bacteremia believed [**12-24**] to line sepsis. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure is resolving, and she has been successfully weaned to a tracheostomy collar for over 48 hours. However, there may be ongoing issues with thick secretions.

2. Hypotension: The patient had been off pressors for 72 hours but had to restart them in the morning. Blood cultures from [**1-29**] have grown [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 1591**] [**Last Name (un) **] to Linezolid, but repeat cultures have been negative since [**1-31**]. A CT scan showed continued colitis, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been negative for five days. The white blood cell count (WBC) has trended down, and there is no notable temperature.

   respiratory failure, renal failure, volume overload, VRE bacteremia,
   CMV viremia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure s/p trach on [**2-7**] with significant
   improvement: now tolerating TC but ongoing O2 needs.
   Bibasilar infiltrates with small effusions on CT.  Will benefit from
   trach downsize to cuffless to allow for PMV. To be done next week.
   2. Leukocytosis - stable at ~ 27.
   Other ID issues: c diff neg x 4, off PO vanc. Off meropenem. CMV and
   VRE bacteremia, on treatment.
   Complicated appearing pleural effusions but small and likely due to
   volume overload in setting of hypoalbuminemia.
   3. Sepsis / VRE bacteremia: cont linezolid (day 13/14)
   4. CMV viremia: cont ganciclovir - question of malignancy. Recheck
   viral load. Heme consult appreciated. Likely a 3 wk course. Day [**10-13**]
   5. Afib with RVR - suboptimal rate control on metoprolol and reducing
   fluid removal. Off amio.
   6. Anuric renal failure: tolerated CVVH with negative balances. To
   transition to HD Monday.
   7. Elevated alk phos:  no clear etiology
   8. Possible hematologic malignancy vs MDS - appreciate hematology
   consult. LAP pending. [**Month (only) 60**] been bone marrow bx.
   9. Hypothyroidism: on IV levothyroxine, will switch to PO
   10. FEN - PEG to be placed next week

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of fever, respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for over 72 hours. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/42 to 134/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheostomy collar. She has been successfully weaned off the ventilator and is tolerating the tracheostomy collar well.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. Her blood cultures from January 29th grew bacteria sensitive to linezolid, but subsequent cultures have been negative since January 31st. Her C. difficile test is negative. She has continued to have episodes of hypotension, requiring the restart of norepinephrine infusion this morning. Her creatinine levels are increasing, indicating possible worsening renal function.

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old woman with a complicated recent history transferred here
   for ongoing respiratory failure, renal failure, volume overload, VRE
   bacteremia, CMV viremia.  She has made some progress following
   tracheostomy and is now tolerating trach collar.  Although we had hoped
   to transition to hemodialysis, her current obligate ins and
   intermittent need for vasopressors has caused renal to recommend CVVH.
   Acute respiratory failure
   - s/p trach on [**2-7**]
   - now tolerating trach collar
   - resumed CVVH for volume removal today
   - may be reasonable to change trach to permit possible PMV, although
   this is not feasible until a week or two after trach placement.
   Hypotension
   - etiology uncertain; at present she is off pressors
   - repeat echocardiogram
   Leukocytosis - stable at ~ 28
   - follow up hematology consult recommendations
   - given myelophthisic picture of [**Last Name (LF) 1774**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require bone marrow
   biopsy if peripheral studies are non-diagnostic.
   CMV viremia
   - cont ganciclovir (Likely a 3 wk course. Day XX/21)
   - question of malignancy. Recheck viral load.
   - Heme consult appreciated.
   Sepsis / VRE bacteremia: cont linezolid (day XX/14)
   Other ID issues: c diff neg x 4, off PO vanc. Off meropenem. CMV and
   VRE bacteremia, on treatment.
   Complicated appearing pleural effusions but small and likely due to
   volume overload in setting of hypoalbuminemia.
   5. Afib with RVR - suboptimal rate control on metoprolol and reducing
   fluid removal. Off amio.
   6. Anuric renal failure: tolerated CVVH with negative balances. To
   transition to HD Monday.
   7. Elevated alk phos:  no clear etiology
   8. Possible hematologic malignancy vs MDS - appreciate hematology
   consult. LAP pending. [**Month (only) 60**] been bone marrow bx.
   9. Hypothyroidism: on IV levothyroxine, will switch to PO
   10. FEN - PEG to be placed next week
   11. Anemia - likely due to chronic disease, phlebotomies, mild
   gastritis. Agree with transfusion to keep Hct >21. Last transfusion
   [**2-11**].
   12. Code status - full but should be readdressed with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure and shock. The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent medical history, including ongoing respiratory failure, renal failure, volume overload, VRE bacteremia, and CMV viremia. 

The patient has made progress following a tracheostomy and is now tolerating the trach collar. However, she still requires intermittent need for vasopressors and has obligate ins. The plan is to resume CVVH for volume removal today. It may be reasonable to change the trach to permit possible PMV, although this is not feasible until a week or two after trach placement.

The patient's hypotension etiology is uncertain, and she is currently off pressors. A repeat echocardiogram is recommended. The patient also has leukocytosis, stable at approximately 28, and is being monitored with follow-up hematology consult recommendations. A bone marrow biopsy may be required if peripheral studies are non-diagnostic due to myelophthisic picture.

The patient is being treated for CMV viremia with ganciclovir and has ongoing sepsis/VRE bacteremia. Other ID issues, such as c diff neg x 4, are being addressed, and the patient is off PO vanc and meropenem. The patient has small appearing pleural effusions likely due to volume overload in the setting of hypoalbuminemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent medical history. The main concerns and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation support and has undergone a tracheostomy. There may be a need to change the tracheostomy tube to allow for possible peripheral venous (PV) access in the future.

2. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's low blood pressure is uncertain, and she is currently off from vasopressor medications. Further evaluation, including another echocardiogram, is recommended.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated and stable at around 28. Hematology consult recommendations should be followed, and a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary if peripheral studies are non-diagnostic.

4. CMV viremia: The patient is currently receiving ganciclovir treatment for CMV infection, which will likely continue for another three weeks. A hematology consult is appreciated due to the perplexing lack of known immunosuppression.

5. Sepsis/VRE bacteremia: The patient is being treated with linezolid for a 14-day course to address VRE bacteremia.

6. Pleural effusions: These effusions appear complicated but are small and likely due to volume overload in the setting of hypoalbuminemia.

7. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F h/o F with resolving respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure on
   CVVH for volume removal, VRE bacteremia & CMV viremia.
   # Hypoxia
 Pt is s/p trach on [**2-7**], tolerating trach collar well.
   Resolving, etiology of prolonged hypoxia thought due to ARDS & volume
   overload, pt has been  successfully weaned to trach collar for several
   days now with progressive volume removal; however, recent CXR was
   concerning for increased pulmonary edema in the setting of stopping
   CVVH.
   - CVVH reinitiated yesterday, fluid balance approx even since yesterday
   morning
   - will likely need to aim for net 1L negative today
   - Completed Linezolid [**2-13**]
   - f/u blood & sputum Cx
 no new growth today
   - will follow-up with surgery regarding trach resizing for Wednesday or
   Thursday and whether this can be accomplished with PEG tube
   # Hypotension : Off pressors since 8am [**2-13**], initiated CVVH. SBP
   maintaining >120. Echo performed showed nl LV size and wall motion with
   LVEF >55% (no pericardial effusion) and mild-mod MR and 2+TR
   - follow-up cultures to r/o persistent or new infection
 no new growth
   to date
   - will reassess for possible transition to HD tomorrow
   - would change out PICC line if recurrent fever
   - Completed Linezolid [**2-13**]
   - continue Gancyclovir for CMV viremia  Day 13 (touch base with ID
   regarding length of course)
   - recheck CMV viral load on [**2-15**]
   - continue levothyroxine 150mg PO daily + insulin gtt
   # ARF/CRI
Etiology of oliguric renal failure unclear,  differential
   includes ATN, drug toxicity. Now on CVVH
   - If BP stable off pressors, would retry HD possibly tomorrow
   - profoundly low Ca & Phos, will continue aggressive replacement scales
   - appreciate renal recs
   # CV: CAD s/p stenting in
06, currently in A.Fib.
   - continue ASA 81mg & Metoprolol 25mg TID with hold parameters
   # ANEMIA
 Pt with anemia of chronic dz started on epoeitin per renal,
   +h/o GIB in 06 & EGD [**2-1**] confirmed gastritis. Transfused 1u pRBCs on
   [**2-13**] for HCT of 20
   - maintain hct with goal >23
   - continue Epo 10,000u 3x/wk per renal
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
    # Elev Alk Phos/LDH: Etiology unclear.  Occult malignancy w/u neg to
   date, AFP of 3. CMV possible etiology, thought atypical presentation.
   Would perform HIV screen if pt consentable to evaluate why
   immunosupressed for CMV. Peripheral smear shows many immature cells,
   hem onc consulted and feel this is likely c/w infectious response
   - f/u Hem/Onc recs, LAP pending
   - continue Gangcyclovir for CMV viremia, f/u VL from [**2-9**]
   #DM2
Pt having low BS, started insulin gtt per endocrine
   - continue per endocrine
   - recheck T4 and THBR (T3 uptake) approx [**2-21**]
   # Hypothyroid
 switch to po Levothyroxine 150mg po daily
   - continue per endocrine
   # Wounds: multiple areas of sacral & facial skin breakdown, apprec
   wound care recs
   # Afib with RVR: Patient  afib with RVR improved on amiodarone but has
   not tolerated beta blocker.
   - continue amiodarone
   - beta blocker as tolerated
   - may need to decrease output to improve volume status and improve
   heart rate

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old woman with a complicated recent history transferred here
   for ongoing respiratory failure, renal failure, volume overload, VRE
   bacteremia, CMV viremia.  She has made some progress following
   tracheostomy and is now tolerating trach collar.  Although we had hoped
   to transition to hemodialysis, her current obligate ins and
   intermittent need for vasopressors has caused renal to recommend CVVH.
   Acute respiratory failure
   s/p trach on [**2-7**]
   now tolerating trach collar
   resumed CVVH for volume removal yesterday
   may be reasonable to change trach to permit possible PMV, although this
   is not feasible until a week or two after trach placement.
   wean FiO2
   Hypotension
   - etiology uncertain; at present she is off pressors
   Leukocytosis - stable at ~ 28
   - follow up hematology consult recommendations
   - given myelophthisic picture of [**Last Name (LF) 1774**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require bone marrow
   biopsy if peripheral studies are non-diagnostic.
   CMV viremia
   - cont ganciclovir (Likely a 3 wk course)
   - Heme consult appreciated given perplexing lack of known
   immunosuppression
   Sepsis / VRE bacteremia
   - cont linezolid for 14d course
   Complicated appearing pleural effusions
   - are small and (per prior notes) felt likely due to volume overload in
   setting of hypoalbuminemia.
    Afib with RVR
   - rate control adequate
   Anuric renal failure
   - on CVVH per renal
   - try to transition to HD
   Possible hematologic malignancy vs MDS
    - appreciate hematology consult. LAP pending. [**Month (only) 60**] require bone marrow
   bx.
   Hypothyroidism
   - on levothyroxine
   Diabetes
   - discuss with endo.  Favor considering transition to SQ, although may
   wait for HD to do so.
   FEN
    - likely PEG soon
   Anemia
   - Transfusion to keep Hct >21. Last transfusion [**2-11**].

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent history, including respiratory failure, renal failure, volume overload, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. She has undergone a tracheostomy and is now tolerating the trach collar. However, she continues to require CVVH for volume removal and intermittent vasopressors.

The patient's current medical complications include acute respiratory failure, hypotension of unknown etiology, leukocytosis, CMV viremia, VRE bacteremia, complicated pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anuric renal failure, and possible hematologic malignancy vs myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). She also has hypothyroidism, diabetes, and anemia.

The patient's plan includes continuing ganciclovir for CMV viremia, linezolid for VRE bacteremia, CVVH for anuric renal failure, and hemodialysis (HD) transition. She will also be evaluated by a hematology consult for possible hematologic malignancy or MDS. Other ongoing ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resusc"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F h/o F with resolving respiratory failure (ARDS [**12-24**] PNA), oliguric
   renal failure (had been on CVVH for volume removal), VRE bacteremia &
   CMV viremia, on trach collar/off vent.
   # Hypoxia
 Pt is s/p trach on [**2-7**], tolerating trach collar well.
   Resolving, etiology of prolonged hypoxia thought due to ARDS & volume
   overload, pt has been successfully weaned to trach collar for several
   days now with progressive volume removal; however, recent CXR was
   concerning for increased pulmonary edema [**2-13**] after stopping CVVH. Has
   been on 50% FiO2 since trach collar placed.
   - CVVH reinitiated yesterday, fluid balance approx even since yesterday
   morning
   - will likely need to aim for net 1L negative today
   - Completed Linezolid [**2-13**]
   - f/u blood & sputum Cx
 no new growth today
   - will follow-up with surgery regarding trach resizing for Wednesday or
   Thursday and whether this can be accomplished with PEG tube
   - decrease FiO2 to 40%, recheck ABG
   # Hypotension : Off pressors since 8am [**2-13**], initiated CVVH. SBP
   maintaining >120. Echo performed showed nl LV size and wall motion with
   LVEF >55% (no pericardial effusion) and mild-mod MR and 2+TR
   - follow-up cultures to r/o persistent or new infection
 no new growth
   to date
   - will reassess for possible transition to HD tomorrow
   - would change out PICC line if recurrent fever
   - Completed Linezolid [**2-13**]
   - continue Gancyclovir for CMV viremia  Day 14 (touch base with ID
   regarding length of course)
   - recheck CMV viral load on [**2-15**] (viral load [**2-9**]
 not detectable)
   - continue levothyroxine 150mg PO daily
   # ARF/CRI
Etiology of oliguric renal failure unclear, differential
   includes ATN, drug toxicity. Now on CVVH
   - If BP stable off pressors, would retry HD possibly tomorrow
   - profoundly low Ca & Phos, will continue aggressive replacement scales
   - appreciate renal recs
   # CV: CAD s/p stenting in
06, currently in A.Fib.
   - continue ASA 81mg & Metoprolol 25mg TID with hold parameters
 would
   not increase dose to leave room in BP for potential HD
   # ANEMIA
 Pt with anemia of chronic dz started on epoeitin per renal,

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of femoral hernia, currently in the ICU for resolving respiratory failure (ARDS), oliguric renal failure, VRE bacteremia, and CMV viremia. She has been on a tracheostomy collar, tolerating it well, and has been weaned off the ventilator. Her fluid balance is approximately even, and she has been initiated on CVVH. She is also on Gancyclovir for CMV viremia. The patient's blood pressure is stable without the need for pressors, and her heart function is normal with an ejection fraction >55%. She has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. Her electrolytes are low, and she requires aggressive replacement. The patient has anemia of chronic disease and was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells. She is also being treated for possible CMV-related anemia. Her alkaline phosphatase and LDH levels are elevated, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown and requires wound care. She is being treated for atrial fibrillation with a heart rate goal of <110. She has multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypothyroidism. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's recent chest X-ray showed increased pulmonary edema, which could indicate a worsening respiratory condition, such as pneumonia.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, and her kidney function needs to be closely monitored to prevent further deterioration.
3. Infection: The patient has VRE bacteremia and CMV viremia, indicating an ongoing infection that requires prompt treatment and monitoring.
4. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, there is a risk of hypotension due to the use of CVVH and other factors.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, and her heart rhythm needs to be monitored to maintain a controlled heart rate.
6. Wound Infection: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, which increases the risk of wound infection and requires appropriate wound care.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She is currently on hemodialysis and has a tracheostomy collar in place. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 99/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a tracheostomy mask. She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

24-hour events include a change in metoprolol dosage due to correlation with decreased blood pressure, initiation of hemodialysis, and the recommendation to discontinue ganciclovir if the CMV viral load is negative. The patient's insulin regimen has been started with NPH and will transition to regular insulin. PEG placement is pending, and the patient's oncology recommendations are to hold bone marrow studies due to elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for fever, leukocytosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Her fluid balance shows a total input of 1,893 mL and a total output of 2,000 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -107 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female who has a history of ARDS, pneumonia, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She is currently in the ICU and is on dialysis, tracheostomy collar, and awaiting PEG placement. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 99/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may indicate a risk of hypoxia. This could be due to her ARDS or volume overload. The medical team should continue managing her volume status with hemodialysis and monitor ABG levels to adjust FiO2 accordingly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she has been off pressors since 8 am on 2/13. It is important to monitor her closely and consider adjusting her fluid input, especially since she is on hemodialysis.
3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and low-grade fever. This could indicate an ongoing infection. Cultures should be followed to rule out persistent or new infections, and possible sources like PICC lines or temporary dialysis lines should be evaluated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female who is currently in the ICU with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She has completed linezolid treatment for VRE bacteremia and is currently on ganciclovir for CMV viremia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 99/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy collar in place.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal potassium levels. Her liver enzymes are within normal limits, and her electrolyte levels are mostly within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever/leukocytosis/tachypnea/tachycardia: The patient's fever curve is flat, and she has an increased white blood cell count. Continue ganciclovir for CMV viremia, and follow-up with surveillance blood cultures, urine cultures, C. difficile stool test, and chest X-ray. Consider removing and re-siting arterial lines and temporary dialysis line, and change the temporary HD line on Friday. Leave the PICC line in place pending rehab needs.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia (PNA), CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD), wearing a tracheostomy collar, and awaiting refitting and PEG placement.

24-hour events include:
- The patient minimally responsive but seems to understand, as indicated by nodding her head when addressed by a Portuguese translator.
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE), which came back negative.
- The patient experienced tachycardia and tachypnea, leading to concerns about fluid overload. She was placed on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5, but this resulted in a significant drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP). After repositioning, the patient became hypotensive, desaturated, and experienced a drop in SBP from the 150s to 80s, indicating possible hypovolemia or derecruitment atelectasis. The patient received albumin and normal saline (NS), and recruitment maneuvers were attempted, including increasing PEEP to 20 to recruit more lung. However, the SBP decreased again despite fluids. The ventilator mode was changed to pressure control initially with PEEP 10, then decreased to PEEP 8 with a driving pressure of 28.
- The patient's temperature is 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit (axillary), and she failed respiratory system compliance (RSBI).
- Allergies include heparin agents, succinylcholine, and unknown.
- The last dose of antibiotics (ganciclovir) was given on [**2130-2-15**] at 06:00 PM.
- The patient is currently on various ICU medications, including ganciclovir, linezolid, metoprolol, and others.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Vital signs and flow sheet data as of [**2130-2-17**] 07:11 AM show:
- Maximum temperature (Tmax): 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.2 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Current temperature (Tcurrent): 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.2 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Heart rate (HR): 107 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 100-125 bpm
- Blood pressure (BP): 129/58 mmHg (with a previous reading of 80/38 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate (RR): 29 breaths per minute (inspiration), with a normal range of 16-46 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 100%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation (AF"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Portuguese translator: Pt minimally responsive but seems to
   understand, nods head
   - CTA to r/o PE: Negative for PE
   - To r/o fluid overload as etiology of tachycardia/tachypnea, placed on
   PS 5 /PEEP 5, but dropped SBP by 50 pts, raising concern for PE, but
   CTA negative, although demonstrated L B pleural effusions.  After
   repositioning s/p CTA, became tachycardic, desatting, SBP dropping from
   150s to 80s quickly, leading to concern for (1) hypovolemia, and (2)
   derecruitment [**12-24**] atelectasis.  Received albumin and 500cc NS (hct
   stable, no hemorrhagic shock).  Recruitment manuevers: PEEP increased
   to 20 to recruit more lung briefly, but SBP decreased again even after
   fluids.  Changed to pressure control initially with PEEP 10, then
   decreased to PEEP 8 with driving pressure 28.
   - T 100.2 axillary, failed RSBI
   - Vent management: A/C now as pressure control lead to gradually

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, PNA, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She is currently on HD and awaiting refitting and PEG placement. The patient's 24-hour events include a negative CTA ruling out PE, concern for PE with subsequent hypotension and tachycardia after repositioning, and a positive RSBI indicating possible infection. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.2°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/58 mmHg to 162/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume of 400 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an RSBI of 163. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi, soft NT ND BS+, and 2+ pitting edema at the lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 23.6-27.3 thousand/mm3, Hct of 24.3-25.1%, Plt of 130-151 thousand/mm3, Cr of 0.6-1."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Portuguese translator: Pt minimally responsive but seems to
   understand, nods head
   - CTA to r/o PE: Negative for PE
   - To r/o fluid overload as etiology of tachycardia/tachypnea, placed on
   PS 5 /PEEP 5, but dropped SBP by 50 pts, raising concern for PE, but
   CTA negative, although demonstrated L B pleural effusions.  After
   repositioning s/p CTA, became tachycardic, desatting, SBP dropping from
   150s to 80s quickly, leading to concern for (1) hypovolemia, and (2)
   derecruitment [**12-24**] atelectasis.  Received albumin and 500cc NS (hct
   stable, no hemorrhagic shock).  Recruitment manuevers: PEEP increased
   to 20 to recruit more lung briefly, but SBP decreased again even after
   fluids.  Changed to pressure control initially with PEEP 10, then
   decreased to PEEP 8 with driving pressure 28.
   - T 100.2 axillary, failed RSBI
   - Vent management: A/C now as pressure control lead to gradually

   Assessment and Plan
   79F h/o ARDS [**12-24**] PNA, oliguric renal failure (on CVVH, transitioning to
   HD), finished linezolid for VRE bacteremia, continuing on ganciclovir
   for CMV viremia (awaiting CMV viral load), on trach collar/off vent.
   # Hypoxia:  Original etiology [**12-24**] ARDS [**12-24**] PNA & volume overload.
   Recent hypoxia likely [**12-24**] derecruitment related to atelectasis worsened
   with repositioning and B effusions per CT scan (no PE); also concern
   for pulmonary infection given copious thick secretions
   -          Attempt to move off AC back to PS/PEEP today, wean down
   FiO2.  Pending IP re: resizing trach, PEG placement
   -          Supportive care: Nebs, suction
   # Hypotension:  Rapid drops in SBP likely [**12-24**] hypovolemia given recent
   aggressive diuresis and HD (hct stable but no bump in setting of fluid
   administration), but also possible contribution from infection.
   Initial concern also for anaphylaxis [**12-24**] IV contrast but SBP responded
   to fluid and albumin.
   -          Continue metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
   -          Trend hct to r/o hemorrhage given hemoccult positive
   -          HD today; may need CVVH.  Goal even fluid balance.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/tachypnea/tachycardia: WBC 26, fever curve
   increasing.  Continuing gancyclovir for CMV viremia (day 13/14),
   pending d/c if CMV viral load returns as negative.
   -          ?Infection: Possible source may be lines (PICC, art,
   temporary dialysis line); remove/resite arterial line today, leave PICC
   pending rehab needs, consider changing temporary HD catheter over
   wire.  Follow surveillance blood cx, urine cx, Cdiff stool, CXR; send
   sputum for cx.
   -          Abx: Start ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin (double coverage for
   gram negatives), vancomycin (for HAP)
   # CV: CAD s/p stenting in

   - Rhythm: Afib with RVR.  Rate controlled on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **];
   consider decreasing dose if SBP drops again
   - Risk: ASA 81mg

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has developed tachypnea and tachycardia, with an inability to provide their own medical history due to a language barrier. The patient has allergies to heparin agents and succinylcholine. They were last administered antibiotics on February 15th at 06:00 PM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/58 mmHg to 161/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and weighs 113 kg. Fluid balance reveals a total intake of 3,150 mL with 925 mL given through the PO route, 1,608 mL through IV fluids, and 102 mL of blood products. The total output is 0 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 163, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 27 cmH2O, and plateau pressure is 23 cmH2O. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   79F h/o ARDS secondary to pneumonia, oliguric renal failure (now
   transitioned to HD), VRE bacteremia (off linezolid [**2-13**]) & CMV
   viremia.  The major recent event is her decompensation yesterday; she
   had substantial signs of intravascular volume depletion but other
   things are certainly in the differential.
   # Hypoxia:  Original etiology [**12-24**] ARDS [**12-24**] PNA, volume overload.  Now
   s/p trach on [**2-7**].  Volume management with HD starting [**2-15**].  Daily
   goal net 1L negative, wean FiO2 as tolerated (monitor ABG).  Sputum cx
   [**2-11**] demonstrated sparse yeast growth, likely contaminant.
   -          Pending surgery rec re: resizing trach
   -          Pending surgery rec re: PEG placement
   -          Volume status: Manage with HD, decrease IVF input, decrease
   NS input, change as many meds to PO as possible
   # Hypotension: Off pressors since 8am [**2-13**], volume managed via CVVH and
   now HD.  LVEF >55%, no pericardial effusion, no WMA, mild-mod MR and
   2+TR.  On [**2-15**], dropped pressure to 79, responded to 500cc ND bolus
   without pressors.  Question whether BP drop 2/2 metoprolol
   administration v. new infectious process.
   -          Follow cultures to r/o persistent or new infection:  NGTD
   from [**2-11**].
   -          Monitor to assess if BB dropping pressure
   # Fever/leukocytosis: WBC 23.6, roughly stable, down from high of
   37.7.  Low-grade fever to 100.  Completed linezolid [**2-13**] for VRE
   bacteremia, still on gancyclovir for CMV viremia (day [**11-5**]).
   - Possible source: PICC, art, temporary dialysis line; hold on resiting
   unless persistently febrile or decompensates clinically
   - Continue gancyclovir dosed for HD 1.25 mg/kg post HD 3xweekly until
   CMV viral load negative
   # Elevated alk phos/LDH v. elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase:
   Question occult malignancy v. inflammation (low leukocyte alkaline
   phosphatase would be more specific for CML, MDS in setting of elevated
   alk phos/LDH).
   -          Consider obtaining HCP consent for HIV
   -          Heme/onc consult to assess need for further occult
   malignancy w/u
   # ARF/CRI: Etiology ATN v drug toxicity.  Starting HD today.  Review
   renal recs, place tunneled HD catheter later this week.
   # CV: CAD s/p stenting in

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to pneumonia, which has led to respiratory failure. They are currently on mechanical ventilation.

2. Oliguric renal failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, which means their kidneys are not producing enough urine. They are transitioning to hemodialysis (HD).

3. VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) bacteremia: The patient previously had VRE bacteremia, for which they completed linezolid therapy. They are still on ganciclovir for CMV (cytomegalovirus) viremia.

4. Hypotension: The patient has been off pressors since February 13th and is being volume managed via continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and now HD. They responded to a 500cc normal saline bolus without the need for pressors.

5. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and low-grade fever. They completed linezolid for VRE bacteremia and are still on ganciclovir for CMV viremia.

6. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and LDH: The patient's alkaline phosphatase and LDH levels are elevated. This could be due to inflammation or an underlying malignancy"

   decompensated substantially.
   Acute respiratory failure
   s/p trach on [**2-7**]
   CT is adequate to exclude large PE, but her combination of low-grade
   fever, increased sputum, and respiratory decompensation yesterday
   suggests a possible new HCAP.  Sputum GNR on gram stain are worrisome
   as well:
   -          vanco

   Hypotension
   -          she responded with hypotension to PEEP and improved with
   volume
   -          no clear evidence for septic shock at this point, but it is
   concerning that this may develop
   CMV viremia
   - cont ganciclovir (three week course)
   - Heme consult appreciated given perplexing lack of known
   immunosuppression
   Sepsis / VRE bacteremia

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She had been improving but yesterday decompensated substantially. The patient's current conditions include acute respiratory failure, hypotension, CMV viremia, sepsis/VRE bacteremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anuric renal failure, possible hematologic malignancy vs MDS, hypothyroidism, diabetes, FEN, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of respiratory failure and the presence of ARDS indicate a potential complication related to her respiratory system.
2. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The combination of low-grade fever, increased sputum, and respiratory decompensation suggests the possibility of a new healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).
3. Hypotension: The patient's response to positive pressure with hypotension indicates a potential cardiovascular complication that needs to be closely monitored.
4. CMV viremia: The patient is already receiving treatment for CMV viremia with ganciclovir, but it is essential to continue monitoring her viral load and clinical response.
5. Sepsis/VRE bacteremia: The patient has completed a course of linezolid for VRE bacteremia, but follow-up cultures are necessary to ensure clearance of the infection. Recurrent"

   gallbladder is overall similar to that seen on the ultrasound of
   [**2130-2-1**] and
   the CT of [**2130-1-30**].  A small amount of fluid is seen around the
   gallbladder,
   consistent with the ascites that was seen on the CT.  The common duct

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, oliguric renal failure, and multiple comorbidities. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with VAP. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she continues to have fevers, leukocytosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Her WBC count is elevated at 26.0. Imaging shows sludge within a distended gallbladder without wall thickening, and there is a small amount of fluid around the gallbladder consistent with ascites. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and she is on multiple medications including ganciclovir for CMV viremia, antibiotics for suspected infection, and metoprolol for heart rate control. The patient has a DNR code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may worsen due to atelectasis, pulmonary infection, or derecruitment.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections, particularly in her lines, urinary tract, and respiratory tract. Close surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, requiring adjustments in fluid balance and possibly transitioning to continuous renal replacement therapy.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient may develop hepatic dysfunction due to sepsis, medications, or underlying"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, oliguric renal failure, and previous linezolid use for VRE bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with CMV viremia and is currently on ganciclovir treatment. The patient is also on a tracheostomy collar and off the ventilator. She is experiencing hypoxia and respiratory failure due to VAP, which is suspected to be caused by Gram-negative rods. 

The patient's medical history includes CAD with stenting, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She has a current diagnosis of DM2 and is being treated with NPH and regular insulin. 

The patient's current laboratory values show elevated WBC count, Hct, and Plt. Imaging reveals sludge within a distended gallbladder without wall thickening. The common bile duct measures 9 mm. There is also a small amount of fluid around the gallbladder consistent with ascites.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing with antibiotics for VAP, considering discontinuation of ganciclovir since the viral load is undetectable, holding off on vent changes, and considering weaning FiO2 and PEEP later today or tomorrow. The patient is also scheduled for hemodialysis today with a goal of 1 L.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with hypoxia. They have been receiving various treatments and interventions, including mechanical ventilation, antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), dialysis, and heart failure management. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/63 mmHg to 147/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already being treated for VAP, so close monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or respiratory decline is essential.
2. Heart failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. Continuous monitoring of fluid balance, cardiac function, and symptoms such as shortness of breath or edema is necessary.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels is required.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although DVT prophylaxis has been initiated, regular assessment for signs of DVT, such as swelling or pain in the extremities, is crucial.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent medical history, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She has been admitted to the ICU and has been improving but experienced a decompensation yesterday due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 117/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and possible hematologic malignancy vs myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics for suspected gram-negative bacterial infection, antiviral medication for CMV viremia, and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal sludge and a distended gallbladder, small amount of ascites, and evolving right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes acute respiratory failure, CMV viremia, sepsis/VRE bacteremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anuric renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), CMV (cytomegalovirus) viremia, and VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) bacteremia. She was initially improving but experienced a decompensation due to VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) yesterday. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, tracheostomy, fever, increased sputum production, and respiratory decompensation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent decompensation suggests the possibility of new hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has been placed on antibiotics to cover Gram-negative rods.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's previous history of ARDS may contribute to her current respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and appropriate ventilation support are necessary.
3. CMV viremia: The patient is on a three-week course of ganciclovir for CMV viremia. Regular monitoring of viral load is essential.
4. Anuric renal failure: The patient is currently on hemodialysis due to anuric renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte balance is crucial.
5. Sepsis/VRE bacteremia: Although the patient completed a 14-day course of linezolid, follow-up cultures should be conducted as recent decompensation could represent"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent medical history. She has been diagnosed with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), CMV viremia (cytomegalovirus infection), and VRE bacteremia (vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection). The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, fever, increased sputum production, and decompensation of her respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent decompensation and worsening respiratory status suggest a possible new healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and the presence of GNR (gram-negative rods) in the sputum culture raises concern for VAP. The current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics covering for VAP.

2. Recurrence of VRE bacteremia: Although the patient has completed a course of linezolid, there is a concern for recrudescence of the VRE bacteremia. It is important to follow cultures to monitor for any signs of bacterial recurrence.

3. CMV viremia: The patient is already on ganciclovir for CMV viremia, but ongoing monitoring and completion of the three-week course of treatment will be necessary.

4. Anuric renal failure: The patient is now on hemodialysis (HD) due to anuric renal failure. Close monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications, including hypoxemia, hypotension, heart failure, and renal failure.

24-hour events include starting hemodialysis, changing antibiotics to oral, increasing insulin dosage, and resolving hypotension with fluid administration. The patient also has an arterial line, PICC line, and dialysis catheter in place. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), indicating that they do not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory status, further deterioration of renal function, development of infections due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines, and potential cardiac events given the presence of atrial fibrillation and heart failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She had been improving but decompensated yesterday due to VAP. The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory decompensation, suggesting new hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). Gram-negative bacilli (GNR) on gram stain are worrisome, and a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray indicates possible infection. Treatment involves vancomycin, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. Ventilator settings will be continued, and non-invasive ventilation will be attempted.

2. CMV viremia: The patient is currently on a three-week course of ganciclovir for CMV viremia. Since the most recent viral load is negative, the ganciclovir can be discontinued.

3. Sepsis/VRE bacteremia: The patient completed a 14-day course of linezolid for VRE bacteremia. Cultures should be followed since her recent decompensation could represent a recurrence.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Rate control is adequate at present.

5. Anuric renal failure: The patient is now on hemodialysis. A discussion with the dialysis team tomorrow"

   Total time spent: 40
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints are respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), renal failure, and volume overload. 

The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She was improving but decompensated due to VAP yesterday. There is a new hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) suggested by fever, increased sputum production, and respiratory decompensation. The sputum gram stain shows GNR, which is worrisome, and there is a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, ganciclovir, and levothyroxine. She also has a central line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place. 

The assessment and plan include treating the new HCAP with cefepime and azithromycin, continuing current ventilator settings, monitoring for CMV viremia, completing the linezolid course, following cultures, and discussing plans for a tunneled line with the renal team. The patient is also being evaluated for possible hematologic malignancy or myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as ongoing management of diabetes, hypothyroidism, and anemia. 

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires continued ICU care."

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and previous infections including VRE bacteremia and CMV viremia. She is currently on treatment for Pseudomonas VAP with ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an irregular heart rhythm. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. Her laboratory results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and other electrolyte levels. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending. The patient has multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, hypotension, cardiovascular disease, acute renal failure, diabetes, mental status changes, hypothyroidism, and potential occult malignancy. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure with antibiotics and ventilation adjustments, close monitoring of fluid balance, continuation of hemodialysis, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas VAP and underlying ARDS.
2. Hypotension and possible septic shock from ongoing infection.
3. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal function due to ATN or drug toxicity.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), renal failure on hemodialysis (HD), and now has Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in her sputum. The patient is currently on ceftazidime for antibiotic treatment. She also has other medical conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD) with a stent, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), and chronic kidney injury (CKI).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in her sputum, indicating a possible VAP. This is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period of time.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has shown episodes of hypotension, which may be due to sepsis secondary to the Pseudomonas infection or her underlying CKI. Close monitoring and prompt management of blood pressure are necessary.
3. Wound complications: The patient has stable wounds, but there is a risk of developing wound infections or other complications due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged bed rest.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which could indicate hepatic involvement or biliary obstruction."

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, renal failure on HD, and now has Pseudomonas in her sputum. She is currently on ceftazidime for antibiotic treatment. She has respiratory failure due to ARDS and volume overload, with a recent diagnosis of Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her blood pressure is sensitive to volume, and she requires fluid management during hemodialysis (HD) sessions. She also has a history of CAD with a stent and experiences episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), for which she is being treated with metoprolol. She is also on HD due to acute renal failure of uncertain etiology. Her mental status is stable, but she does not respond well to the healthcare team. She has hypothyroidism being treated with levothyroxine, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels raising suspicion for acalculous cholecystitis, and anemia being managed with erythropoietin and transfusions. She has several wounds that require ongoing wound care. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed Pseudomonas VAP, which is a serious infection commonly seen in patients with mechanical ventilation. It can lead to worsening respiratory failure and potentially progress to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent course, including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), CMV viremia (cytomegalovirus infection), and VRE bacteremia (vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection). She had been improving but last week decompensated due to VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. Her blood pressure is low at 90/36 mmHg, heart rate is elevated at 98-130 bpm, and she has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and requires hemodialysis. She also has diabetes, anemia, and obesity.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's current dependence on mechanical ventilation puts her at risk for complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to high airway pressures.
2. Infection: Given her previous episodes of CMV viremia and VRE bacteremia, there is a possibility of new infections developing, especially with prolonged hospitalization and exposure to invasive devices.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). She is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone a stent placement. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is being treated with metoprolol. Her glucose levels need to be controlled, and she is on insulin therapy. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF)/chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), mental status changes, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels (suggesting possible acalculous cholecystitis), occult malignancy, hypothyroidism, anemia, and wounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas VAP is a significant concern. The infection may worsen her lung function and lead to further complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be attributed to fluid shifts during HD or medication effects. Maintaining adequate blood pressure is crucial to ensure proper organ perfusion.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF)/Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRI): The patient's ARF/CRI requires close monitoring of renal function and continued"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pneumonia, and renal failure on hemodialysis. She is currently infected with Pseudomonas and is being treated with ceftazidime. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 123 beats per minute, blood pressure of 141/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has atrial fibrillation as her heart rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 112.9 kg.

The patient has not received hemodialysis today and therefore did not undergo a ventilator pressure support trial. Her insulin dosage has been increased to 8 units every 6 hours. The placement of a tunneled hemodialysis line was attempted.

The patient has allergies to heparin agents and succinylcholine. The last doses of antibiotics she received were ciprofloxacin on February 18th at 2:13 PM, vancomycin on February 19th at 5:02 PM, and ceftazidime on February 20th at 8:42 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). She now has Pseudomonas infection in her sputum and is being treated with ceftazidime. The patient had a tunneled HD line placed and did not receive HD today, so a ventilator pressure support trial was not attempted. Insulin dosage was increased to regular 8 units every 6 hours. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) update indicates that general surgery will defer until discharge, and they will check with other services. The patient has allergies to heparin agents and succinylcholine. Her last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 02/18/18 at 02:13 PM, vancomycin on 02/19/18 at 05:02 PM, and ceftazidime on 02/20/18 at 08:42 AM. The patient is currently on various ICU medications and other medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, PNA, renal failure on HD, now with Pseudomonas in sputum. She is currently on ceftazidime. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, which has been controlled with metoprolol. She also has a history of CAD with a stent, and her glucose levels need to be closely monitored. The patient is on hemodialysis and has a tunneled HD catheter in place. She has stable mental status but is selective in her responses. There are concerns about elevated alk phos levels, possible occult malignancy, hypothyroidism, anemia, and wounds. The patient's respiratory support is on CMV/ASSIST mode with a set Vt of 400 mL, RR of 16, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and RSBI of 96. Physical examination reveals healing herpetic lesions, irregular heart rhythm, diffuse mildly coarse breath sounds bilaterally, and 1+ edema in both lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The presence of Pseudomonas in the sputum suggests a potential bacterial infection, which can lead to VAP. This condition requires prompt management with appropriate antibiotics and consideration for weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent medical history. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement followed by decompensation.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Acute respiratory failure due to tracheostomy and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to ceftazidime. The plan is to continue with the current ventilation settings and start PSV (pressure support ventilation) after hemodialysis (HD).

2. Sepsis and VRE bacteremia. The patient has completed a 14-day course of linezolid. Follow-up cultures are planned to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's heart rate is currently well-controlled, but further management will depend on ongoing monitoring.

4. Anuric renal failure. The patient is now on hemodialysis and has had a tunneled dialysis catheter placed.

5. Diabetes. The patient is on a subcutaneous insulin regimen and is being worked up by the endocrine team to optimize glycemic control.

6. FEN (feeding) has been held due"

","The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She had been improving but last week decompensated due to VAP. She has acute respiratory failure, sepsis/VRE bacteremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anuric renal failure, diabetes, and possible CMV colitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Prolonged or recurrent infections: The patient has a history of CMV viremia, VRE bacteremia, and VAP, indicating a weakened immune system and increased susceptibility to infections.
2. Kidney damage or failure: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to anuric renal failure, which suggests impaired kidney function.
3. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.
4. Poor glycemic control: The patient has diabetes and is on a subcutaneous insulin regimen, indicating a need for close monitoring of blood sugar levels to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, suggesting a risk of malnutrition and the need for proper nutritional support.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is on prophylaxis, there is still a risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, and renal failure on hemodialysis. She is currently being treated for Pseudomonas pneumonia with ceftazidime. The patient tolerated pressure support of 30% last night and is now set to decrease pressure support while maintaining PEEP. The patient has a history of CAD and is on metoprolol for atrial fibrillation. She also has controlled diabetes and is on insulin therapy. The patient's mental status is stable, but she selectively does not respond to the hospital team. She has stable anemia, hypothyroidism, elevated alk phos levels, and a stable wound. The patient is on hemodialysis and has an arterial line and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to her history of ARDS and current Pseudomonas VAP. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the pressure support is decreased too quickly or if there is a resistance to weaning from the ventilator.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored as she is on hemodialysis. Any changes in her renal parameters or fluid balance could indicate worsening renal failure or complications related to dialysis.
3. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient has a history of CAD and is on medication for atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have a history of obesity, atrial fibrillation, and unknown allergies to heparin agents and succinylcholine. The patient has been on various medications including ASA, levothyroxine, PPI, ceftazidime, metoprolol, oxycodone, CHG, nebs, Reglan, xoponex, and epo. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/33 mmHg to 113/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1654 mL, with outputs including 1002 mL through TF, 381 mL through IVF, and 0 mL through blood products. This results in a negative fluid balance of 346 mL.

Respiratory support indicates that the patient is on CPAP/PSV with a pressure support of 10 cmH2O, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and an RSBI of 109. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 310.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the respiratory system and trace edema in both lower extremities"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). The patient also has pseudomonas pneumonia, for which she is being treated with ceftazidime. 

The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, with initial ARDS and subsequent development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The goal is to wean off the ventilator and consider a tracheostomy if necessary. 

The patient's cardiovascular system shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), likely related to her medical condition. Metoprolol has been adjusted to manage her heart rate. 

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which may be due to fluid shifts from hemodialysis, pain medications, sedation, and beta-blockers. 

Regarding glucose control, the patient is receiving Humulin and NPH insulin. 

The patient's renal function is stable, and she is on hemodialysis with a tunneled catheter in place. 

Mental status is stable, but there is some inconsistency in response to different personnel. 

There are ongoing assessments and plans for potential complications such as elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, occult malignancy, hypothyroidism, anemia, and wound care. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through a renal formula, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, renal failure, and pseudomonas pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and is receiving hemodialysis. Her vital signs are stable, but she has an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, as well as abnormalities in electrolytes and liver function tests. There are also signs of infection with a positive culture for pseudomonas and elevated inflammatory markers. The patient's mental status is described as stable, and she has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): Given the multiple lines and catheters in place, there is a risk of developing a CRBSI. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory results, and signs of infection is important.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to pre-existing renal failure. Adjustments in hemodialysis frequency and medication dosages may be necessary.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and other risk factors increase the"

s note
   today reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that she tolerated her

","The patient, Ms. [**Known lastname**], is being closely monitored in the ICU. The critical care staff has provided her with appropriate medical care. The patient tolerated the PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) procedure without any complications. However, there was some hypotension observed around the time of metoprolol dosing, so the dosing of metoprolol was adjusted based on the number of dialysis days. Overall, the patient's examination is stable, except for the PEG site, which appears fine.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Infection at the PEG site: There is a risk of infection at the site where the PEG tube is inserted. Symptoms of infection may include redness, swelling, drainage, or fever.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension during metoprolol dosing. This could be due to various factors such as medication interactions or changes in fluid balance. Close monitoring of blood pressure is important to prevent further episodes of hypotension.

3. Cardiac complications: Metoprolol is a medication used to control heart rate and blood pressure. Adjustments to the dosing of metoprolol may be necessary due to the patient's dialysis schedule. It is essential to monitor the patient's heart function and adjust medication accordingly to avoid any potential cardiac complications.

4. Dialysis-related complications: As the patient is undergoing dialysis, there is a risk of complications related to this procedure. These can include low blood pressure, muscle cramps, dizziness, or electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring the patient's vital signs and electrolyte levels during dialysis is crucial to minimize these risks.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She tolerated her PEG without complications and had some hypotension around metoprolol dosing, which was adjusted based on dialysis days. Her exam is stable, except for the PEG site, which looks fine.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a history of ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can cause low oxygen levels in the blood and can be life-threatening.

2. Pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia: She acquired a hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas bacteria, which is known for its resistance to multiple antibiotics. This infection can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and sepsis.

3. Sepsis/VRE bacteremia/CMV viremia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had sepsis caused by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. These infections can spread throughout the body and cause organ dysfunction, leading to septic shock.

4. Anuric renal failure: She is experiencing anuric renal failure, meaning her kidneys are not producing urine. This can be a complication of sepsis or may have other underlying causes. Renal failure can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the body and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): Ms. [**Known lastname **] has atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder characterized by rapid and irregular beating. The rapid ventricular response indicates that her heart rate is controlled but still elevated.

6. Diabetes: She has diabetes, which is managed with subcutaneous insulin regimen. Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to complications such as infections, kidney damage, and cardiovascular disease.

7. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Given her anuric renal failure, Ms. [**Known lastname **] may have CKD, a long-term condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function. CKD can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.

8. PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy): Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a PEG tube placement, which is a procedure used to provide nutrition when swallowing is difficult. Complications of PEG include infection, bleeding, and leakage of feeding solution.

9. Anemia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has stable anemia, which can be caused by various factors such as chronic disease, blood loss, or bone marrow disorders. Anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath."

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, PNA, renal failure on HD, and now with Pseudomonas PNA on ceftazidime. She has respiratory failure due to ARDS and Pseudomonas VAP. She also has CAD with a stent, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, glucose control issues, acute renal failure, mental status changes, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, possible occult malignancy, hypothyroidism, anemia, and chronic wounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with Pseudomonas PNA and is currently on ceftazidime. She requires appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the infection and prevent further complications.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with appropriate medication and rate control measures.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to fluid shifts from hemodialysis, pain medications, sedation, and beta-blockers. Close monitoring of fluid balance and adjustment of medications are necessary.
4. Glucose control: The patient has fluctuating blood glucose levels that need to be maintained within a target range to avoid complications.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is stable on hemodialysis, but ongoing monitoring and adjustment of treatment are required.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, PNA, renal failure on HD, and now with Pseudomonas VAP. She is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV, with a FiO2 of 30%. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 140s, blood pressure ranging from 116/49 to 152/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypothyroidism. She is on antibiotics for Pseudomonas VAP and undergoing hemodialysis. Her mental status is stable, but there are concerns about her response to healthcare providers. The patient has several medical complications, including ARF/CRI, elevated alk phos levels, occult malignancy, anemia, and wounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as she is on mechanical ventilation with a high FiO2 requirement. There is also evidence of crackles in her chest, indicating possible pneumonia or worsening lung condition.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Her blood pressure readings show wide fluctuations, which could be due to fluid shifts during hemodialysis or other cardiovascular issues.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill, obese male with a history of respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and a recent infection with two strains of Clostridium difficile. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU and has been diagnosed with acute-on-chronic heart failure and acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the risk of developing pneumonia is increased.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic renal failure and recent infection increases the risk of acquiring new infections.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and acute-on-chronic heart failure may predispose him to further cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Worsening renal function: The patient's acute renal failure could progress, leading to further deterioration in renal function.
6. Hypotension and shock: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate ongoing hypotension, which, if not managed appropriately, could lead to shock.

These are some of the potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. It is important to closely monitor the patient and implement appropriate interventions to prevent and manage these"

   79 year old woman with complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV
   viremia, and VRE bacteremia.  She had been improving but decompensated
   last week attributable to Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumnonia.
   Acute respiratory failure
     * s/p trach on [**2-7**]; had been on trach collar but back on vent about
       [**2-16**] due to pneumonia
     * Pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia (acquired while off ventilator)
       sensitive to ceftaz, started on [**2-17**].  Finished eight-day course
       today.   Maintain vigilance for recrudescence.
     * Try TC after dialysis today.
   Sepsis / VRE bacteremia / CMV viremia

   -          rate control remains suboptimal.
   -          She has had substantial trouble with post-metoprolol
   hypotension.  We will try gentle diltiazem today.  If unable to get
   better control, may need to look at other pharmacologic therapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent medical history, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She had been improving but decompensated last week due to Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has sepsis with VRE bacteremia and CMV viremia. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anuric renal failure, diabetes, and a feeding tube in place. The main issue limiting her potential transfer to rehabilitation is stable AFib control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recrudescence of Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient had previously had an episode of Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumonia, which is a type of hospital-acquired lung infection. Although she completed an eight-day course of ceftazidime, there is still a risk for the infection to recur or worsen.
2. Complications related to atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which means her heart rhythm is abnormal and her heart rate is elevated. This can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, or fainting. Rate control remains suboptimal, and she has had trouble with post-metoprolol hypotension. Gentle diltiazem will be tried today, and if not effective, other pharmacologic therapies may be considered.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, PNA, renal failure on HD, and s/p Pseudomonas VAP. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and PNA, which has led to respiratory failure. She is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode and requires suctioning for thick tan sputum. Her RSBI is 104, indicating a need for continued respiratory support.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely due to HD-related fluid shifts, pain medications/sedation, and metoprolol. Her blood pressure ranges from 137/54 mmHg to 163/75 mmHg.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with an irregular heartbeat. She is on diltiazem 60mg QID and will be monitored for rhythm control.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and is on HD. Her Hct levels are within normal range, indicating stable renal function.

5. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is stable, but she responds better to staff in the ICU. Language barriers should be addressed with interpreter sessions.

6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in her electrolytes, including elevated TCO2 and Cr levels. These imbalances need to be corrected and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, renal failure on HD, and now presenting with Pseudomonas pneumonia. She is currently on ceftazidime for the infection. The patient has been experiencing some respiratory issues and is not tolerating weaning to tracheal collar, leading to tachypnea in the 40s.

Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with Pseudomonas pneumonia and is currently being treated with ceftazidime. Pseudomonas infections can be challenging to treat due to antibiotic resistance.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, and she is experiencing difficulty tolerating weaning from mechanical ventilation. This may indicate ongoing respiratory failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be related to fluid shifts during HD, pain medications/sedation, and beta-blockers.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She is currently on metoprolol for rate control, but her heart rhythm needs to be closely monitored.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia and is receiving erythropoietin during HD. Her hemoglobin levels need to be monitored regularly.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated for hypothyroidism with le"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD), currently being treated for Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, hypotension, glucose control issues, acute kidney injury, mental status changes, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, possible occult malignancy, hypothyroidism, anemia, and non-healing wounds. The patient is on multiple medications, including diltiazem for heart rate control, lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and various other medications for her conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/54 to 163/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 41 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV, and an ECG showing atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance is within normal limits, with an intake of 1,429 mL and output of 329 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, and glucose levels, while other parameters are within normal range. Radiology and microbiology reports are pending. The patient's plan includes continuing hemodialysis, attempting tracheal collar weaning post-dialysis, managing cardiovascular and glucose control issues, monitoring renal function, addressing mental status changes, and managing other medical conditions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and previous Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and receiving ceftazidime for Pseudomonas infection. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/54 to 163/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 41 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature of 36.9°C. The patient is experiencing tachypnea and has not tolerated weaning to tracheostomy collar, with an RSBI of 104. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for anxiety. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS, previous pneumonia, and ongoing ventilator dependence. The inability to tolerate weaning from the tracheostomy collar indicates ongoing respiratory distress, which could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for reintubation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and is on maintenance hemodialysis. Complications related to renal failure may include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
3. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a st"

   79 year old woman with complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV
   viremia, and VRE bacteremia.  She had been improving but decompensated
   last week attributable to Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumnonia. Her main
   issue currently is the A-fib with inadequate rate control as well as
   vent-dependent respiratory failure, requiring continued adjusting
   Acute respiratory failure
   s/p trach on [**2-7**]; had been on trach collar but back on vent about [**2-16**]
   due to pneumonia
   Pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia (acquired while off ventilator)
   sensitive to ceftaz, started on [**2-17**].  Finished eight-day course [**2-24**].
   Maintain vigilance for recrudescence.

   then  add Digoxin possibly dosing QOD with level checks). The concern
   remains for tachy induced CM.
   -          She has had substantial trouble with post-metoprolol
   hypotension (now off metop) and BP OK.

The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She has been improving but recently experienced a decompensation due to Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumonia. The main issues currently are atrial fibrillation with inadequate rate control and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recrudescence of Pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Suboptimal rate control in atrial fibrillation, which may lead to tachyarrhythmias.
3. Potential development of congestive heart failure due to inadequate rate control.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy for glycemic control.
7. Anemia and its complications.
8. Renal failure requiring ongoing dialysis.
9. Anxiety and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Please note that this summary and list of potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment and management plan for the patient."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year old woman with complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV
   viremia, and VRE bacteremia.  She had been improving but decompensated
   last week attributable to Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumnonia. Her main
   issue currently is the A-fib with inadequate rate control
   Acute respiratory failure
   s/p trach on [**2-7**]; had been on trach collar but back on vent about [**2-16**]
   due to pneumonia
   Pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia (acquired while off ventilator)
   sensitive to ceftaz, started on [**2-17**].  Finished eight-day course [**2-24**].
   Maintain vigilance for recrudescence.
   Need to get her seated upright and re-trial TC daily (while optimizing
   vol status with HD)
   Sepsis / VRE bacteremia / CMV viremia
   -          completed linezolid 14d course
   -          completed course of  ganciclovir, and repeat CMV viral load
   was negative
   -          susbequet cultures have been neg
    Afib with RVR
   -          rate control remains suboptimal, now on diltiazem with now
   on 60 mg PO qid (will max dilt to 90 mg qid for goal rate ~ 90/min and
   then  add Digoxin possibly dosing QOD with level checks). The concern
   remains for tachy induced CM.
   -          She has had substantial trouble with post-metoprolol
   hypotension (now off metop) and BP OK.
   Anuric renal failure
   -          now on HD via tunneled line
   - Renal OK with digoxin if we need to use it.
   Diabetes
   - on SQ regimen
   FEN
   -          s/p PEG
   -          tube feeds
   Anemia
   -          stable
   Anxiety
   low dose lorazepam prn
   Main issue limiting potential transfer to rehab at present is stable
   Afib control.  If she continues on her present course, should be ready
   for rehab screening in next few days.

","The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She had been improving but decompensated last week due to Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumonia. Her main issue currently is A-fib with inadequate rate control.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/60 mmHg to 163/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 395 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 104, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 16 cmH2O, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal range.

The patient has a history of diabetes, anemia, and renal failure. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) via a tunneled line and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for feeding. The patient also has anxiety, for which she is given low-dose lorazepam as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, renal failure on HD, and s/p Pseudomonas VAP. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to ARDS and volume overload, as well as other comorbidities such as CAD, anxiety, and hypothyroidism. The patient has been on HD and has a tunneled HD catheter in place. Her mental status has improved slightly, and she is responding better to staff. She requires better anxiety control, and there have been concerns about potential medical complications like hypernatremia, atelectasis, and pressure ulcers. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her labs are generally within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anxiety: The patient continues to experience anxiety and requires better control. Lorazepam has been given, but the patient remains very anxious and pulling at her PEG tube.
2. Atelectasis: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for signs of atelectasis, which can occur due to prolonged bed rest and sedation.
3. Pressure Ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility. Regular turning and proper skin assessment are essential.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications like seizures or neurological damage.
5. Fluid Management: The patient's fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently in the ICU and has been on dialysis. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, glucose control issues, hypothyroidism, acute renal failure, mental status changes, liver function test abnormalities, and anemia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.2 C, heart rate 103 bpm, blood pressure 142/98 mmHg, respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 340 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 118.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of VAP: The patient has a history of pseudomonas VAP and is at risk for recurrence due to the presence of increased sputum production. Close monitoring of respiratory status and prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive balance of 1,533 mL since midnight. This could lead to worsening respiratory failure and hypoxia. Careful monitoring and adjustment of fluid intake and output"

   79 year old woman with complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV
   viremia, and VRE bacteremia.  She had been improving but decompensated
   last week attributable to Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumnonia. Her main
   issue currently is the A-fib with inadequate rate control as well as
   vent-dependent respiratory failure, requiring continued adjusting
   Respiratory failure
   s/p trach on [**2-7**]; had been on trach collar but back on vent about [**2-16**]
   due to pneumonia, has been a slow wean since that time.
   Pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia (acquired while off ventilator)
   sensitive to ceftaz, started on [**2-17**].  Finished eight-day course [**2-24**].
   Maintain vigilance for recrudescence. Had some increased sputum
   yesterday (will send ET aspirate today).
   Hold TC today (vol overloaded and not getting HD today)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent course, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She had been improving but decompensated last week due to Pseudomonal nosocomial pneumonia. Her main issues currently are atrial fibrillation with inadequate rate control and vent-dependent respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recrudescence of Pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia: The patient had completed an eight-day course of ceftazidime for the pneumonia, and there was some increased sputum yesterday. It is important to maintain vigilance for any signs of recrudescence.

2. Hypotension: The patient had trouble with post-metoprolol hypotension and is now off metoprolol. The blood pressure is currently okay, but close monitoring is necessary.

3. Anuric renal failure: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) via a tunneled line. HD was held on Saturday for tachycardia, and it will be resumed on Monday. It is important to monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rate control: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) that remains suboptimal. She is currently on diltiazem and digoxin, which seem to have improved her condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a complicated recent medical history, including ARDS, CMV viremia, and VRE bacteremia. She was improving but decompensated last week due to pseudomonal nosocomial pneumonia. Currently, her main issues include atrial fibrillation with inadequate rate control and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation since February 16th and has been slowly weaned. She has completed a course of antibiotics for the pneumonia and is now on maintenance therapy. Her sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and CMV viremia have resolved. She is also experiencing anuric renal failure and is on hemodialysis. Her anxiety has improved with low-dose benzodiazepines. The patient's current medications include diltiazem, digoxin, and regular insulin. She is expected to remain in the ICU for further management and rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum culture will be necessary to detect any potential infection.
2. Recurrence of Pseudomonal Nosocomial Pneumonia: Although the patient has completed a course of antibiotics for the initial pneumonia, there is still a risk of recurrence. Regular assessment of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic management will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS and renal failure on dialysis, who has been treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with ceftazidime. The patient's respiratory failure is likely exacerbated by fluid balance issues. There are signs of potential recurrence of VAP, with the presence of GNR bacteria in sputum and rising white blood cell count. The patient's cardiovascular status includes a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. There are ongoing concerns regarding endocrine control, including glucose management and hypothyroidism. Renal function is stable, but there are ongoing issues with anemia and wound care. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status and requires continued ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) recurrence: The presence of GNR bacteria in sputum and rising white blood cell count suggests a potential recurrence of VAP. Immediate intervention with appropriate antibiotics, such as restarting ceftazidime, is necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's respiratory failure is likely exacerbated by fluid balance issues. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output, along with diuretic therapy if needed, is necessary to prevent further fluid overload.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR): The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure, and coronary artery disease. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to ARDS and pneumonia, as well as fluid overload. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 143/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on diltiazem and low-dose digoxin for rhythm control. She is also on insulin for glucose control and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. The patient's renal function is stable, with ongoing hemodialysis. Her mental status is somewhat somnolent but improving with decreased sedation. The patient has elevated liver enzymes and is being monitored for liver function abnormalities. There are no significant changes in the patient's other systems, and she remains stable overall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of VAP: The patient's sputum culture shows 1+ GNR (Gram-negative rods), indicating a possible recurrence of VAP. Further evaluation and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating ongoing fluid overload. This can contribute"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, and renal failure on hemodialysis. She has been treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with ceftazidime. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there are concerns about fluid overload and the possibility of recurrent VAP. The tracheostomy collar may be weaned today if hemodynamic stability is maintained during hemodialysis.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease with a stent placement and is on medication to control atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Her endocrine status includes stable hypothyroidism and glucose control managed with insulin. She has acute renal failure (ARF) due to either acute tubular necrosis or drug toxicity, for which she is on maintenance hemodialysis.

The patient's mental status is somewhat somnolent, possibly related to sedation medications, and ativan will be decreased to 0.5 mg prn. There are also some liver function test abnormalities that are trending down, and an occult malignancy workup has been held due to a nonspecific elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LAP) level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent VAP: The patient's sputum culture showed 1+ GNR (Gram-negative rods), indicating a possible recurrence of VAP. It is crucial to monitor the patient's respiratory status and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pneumonia (PNA), renal failure on hemodialysis (HD), and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently in the ICU and is alert but nonverbal. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 143/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is on digoxin. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels. A sputum gram stain revealed the presence of gram-negative rods, indicating a possible recurrence of VAP. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is on medication for it. She also has hypothyroidism and is taking levothyroxine. The patient's anemia and liver function tests are stable. She is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has a PICC line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place. She has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum gram stain showed the presence of gram-negative rods, suggesting a possible recurrence of VAP. This is a potential complication that needs to be addressed promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 79F h/o ARDS [**12-24**] PNA, renal failure on HD, s/p
   Pseudomonas VAP (ceftazidime) treated now with GNR in sputum.
   #Respiratory failure:
   Originally [**12-24**] ARDS [**12-24**] PNA + volume overload, s/p Pseudomonas VAP
   treated w/ ceftazadime with 8 day course. Resp failure likely
   exacerbated by fluid balance. HD performed yesterday with >3L removed.
   Also improved w/ HR and BP control (ativan prn).  Now with 1+ GNR in
   sputum from [**2-26**], rising WBC, restarted on Ceftaz yesterday for ? VAP
   recurrence given increased sputum and short course of antibiotics for
   prior pseudomonas.
   - Continue Ceftaz as likely recurrence of VAP, ceftaz-sensitive in the
   past.  Will give 8 day course of therapy
   - F/u sputum cx
   - Trach collar wean when volume status improved and VAP resolves
   - ABG this am showing increased PaCO2 with no change in pH, likely [**12-24**]
   atelectasis. Will get patient OOB to chair today. No need for routine
   ABGs unless clinically indicated.
   #Anemia: Decreasing over last several days, down to 21 today.  ACD,
   guaiac pos stool, history of chronic GIB s/p EGD early in this
   admission just showing gastritis. Epoeitin at HD, transufse for hct
   >23.
   - Will transfuse one unit prbcs today.
   - Given some mild abdominal pain, will image abdomen if no appropriate
   bump in Hct with tx.
   # Abdominal Pain: Unclear cause. PEG site c/d/i. No exudate. Nontender
   around site.
   - Patient has only had minimal BM for several days which may be
   contributing. No clear indication that PEG is source
   - Small guaiac pos stool today prior to SSE being given, will continue
   to monitor, not grossly bloody
   - Pain control
   #CV:  History of CAD s/p stent [**2127**].  Also with afib with RVR.
   - Rhythm: Afib/RVR. Diltiazem 90mg QID, dig dc
d as ativan controlling
   rate
   - Risk: ASA 81mg
   #ENDOCRINE
   **Glucose control: On ISS per endocrine
   - Review endo recs
   **HYPOTHYROID
   STABLE.  Levothyroxine 150mg PO daily. TFTs rechecked, will follow endo
   recs.  Will continue to check weekly.
   #ARF/CRI:
   STABLE.  Etiology [**12-24**] ATN v. drug toxicity.  On HD. Has been
   incontinent of small amount of urine (was anuric prior).
   - Tunneled HD catheter in place
   - Review renal recs, will place foley for 24 hours to quantify urine,
   20cc out over the day yesterday.
   - Continue HD as per renal.
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved. - Hypernatremia resolved, decreased free
   water to 100cc q6H
   # Mental status: Was more somnolent after initiation of ativan.
   Decreased dose to 0.5 mg with improvement in level of alertness.
   - Attempt QOD sessions with interpreter for orientation
   #LFT abnormalities
   Elevated alk phos, LFTs trending down.  Reimage abdomen/gallbladder if
   clinical change.
   ?Occult malignancy:
   STABLE.  Per heme/onc, hold further w/u given nonspecific elevated LAP.
   #Wounds: STABLE.  Continue wound care recs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, anemia, abdominal pain, cardiovascular issues, endocrine disorders, acute renal failure/chronic renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and possible occult malignancy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS and previous pseudomonas VAP. There is a risk of recurrent VAP due to the presence of GNR in sputum and short course of antibiotics. Weaning off the tracheostomy collar may be challenging until VAP resolves.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has been decreasing over the past few days. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this drop, and appropriate transfusions should be considered.
3. Abdominal pain: The cause of the abdominal pain is unclear, and imaging may be necessary to identify any potential sources, such as the PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) site.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of CAD (coronary artery disease) with a stent placement and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, PNA, renal failure on HD, and s/p Pseudomonas VAP. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, CV issues related to CAD and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, endocrine abnormalities including glucose control and hypothyroidism, ARF/CRI with ongoing HD, hypernatremia, mental status changes, LFT abnormalities, and anemia. Additionally, there is a mention of possible occult malignancy and wounds that require care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrence of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) due to the presence of GNR in sputum and a short course of antibiotics for prior Pseudomonas infection.
2. Fluid overload or imbalance due to the patient's respiratory failure and ongoing fluid administration.
3. Hypotension and tachycardia due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
4. Hypothyroidism requiring monitoring and management.
5. Anemia and possible need for transfusion support.
6. Elevated liver function tests, which may indicate hepatic dysfunction.
7. Hypernatremia requiring careful management of fluid balance.
8. Potential occult malignancy that needs further evaluation.
9. Wound care management to prevent infections or complications.

   Pseudomonas VAP (ceftazidime) treated now with GNR in sputum on Ceftaz
   for repeat course for presumed pseudomonas VAP.
   #Respiratory failure:
   Originally [**12-24**] ARDS [**12-24**] PNA + volume overload, s/p Pseudomonas VAP
   treated w/ ceftazadime with 8 day course. Resp failure likely
   exacerbated by fluid balance. HD performed yesterday with >3.5L
   removed.  Also improved w/ HR and BP control (ativan prn).  Now with 1+
   GNR in sputum from [**2-26**], rising WBC, restarted on Ceftaz yesterday for ?
   VAP recurrence given increased sputum and short course of antibiotics
   for prior pseudomonas.
   - Continue Ceftaz as likely recurrence of VAP, ceftaz-sensitive in the
   past.  Will give 15 day course of therapy given concern for recurrence
   - F/u sputum cx for speciation and sensitivies as may have resistant
   pathogen after 8 day abx therapy
   - Trach collar wean, has leak in tracheostomy, IP to evaluate and
   repair.  Will attempt trach mask today.
   - Continue OOB as tolerated daily to improve atelectasis
   #Anemia: Decreasing over last several days, down to 21 yesterday,
   increased to 26 with 1uprbcs.   ACD, guaiac pos stool, history of
   chronic GIB s/p EGD early in this admission just showing gastritis.

   - Given some mild abdominal pain, will image abdomen if HCT continues
   to fall
   # Abdominal Pain: Unclear cause. PEG site c/d/i. No exudate. Nontender
   around site.
   - Patient has only had minimal BM for several days which may be
   contributing. No clear indication that PEG is source
   - Small guaiac pos stool yesterday prior to SSE being given, will

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and previous pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) that was treated with ceftazidime for 8 days. She is currently experiencing a recurrence of suspected pseudomonas VAP, as indicated by the presence of GNR (gram-negative rods) in her sputum. The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, anemia, abdominal pain, cardiovascular issues, endocrine problems, acute renal failure/chronic renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, altered mental status, liver function test abnormalities, and wounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a concern for recurrent VAP due to the presence of GNR in her sputum. She is currently on ceftazidime therapy for presumed VAP recurrence.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing over the past few days. She received a blood transfusion with appropriate improvement in her hematocrit (Hct) levels. Further monitoring and management of her anemia are needed.
3. Abdominal Pain: The cause of the patient's abdominal pain is unclear. She has a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is on sucralfate and lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophyl"

The patient's cardiovascular system includes a history of CAD with stenting and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently on rate control medications. The endocrine system shows stable hypothyroidism. The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN or drug toxicity, and is on HD. There is resolution of hypernatremia. The patient's mental status has improved after reducing the dose of ativan. The liver function tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase, but are trending down. There is a possibility of an occult malignancy, and wound care is ongoing. The patient is on a DNR (do not resuscitate) order and is currently in the ICU."

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and previous pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently on ceftazidime for a presumed recurrence of pseudomonas VAP. 

The patient's 24-hour events include the use of a Portuguese interpreter, removal of an arterial line, sitting out of bed in a chair, transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells, positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding, and a leak in her tracheostomy cuff. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/61 mmHg to 92/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilatory support. 

The patient is alert and interactive but unable to speak due to her tracheostomy. She is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.9 thousand/mm3, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 21.4 g"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). She previously had Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treated with ceftazidime for 8 days. Now, she has developed GNR (gram-negative rod) infection in her sputum, and it is presumed to be a recurrence of VAP. The patient is currently on ceftazidime again for a 15-day course of therapy.

The patient is unable to speak due to a tracheostomy and requires a Portuguese interpreter. Her tracheostomy cuff has a leak, and she will be evaluated by interventional pulmonary (IP) to repair it. She also has bilateral lower extremity edema and pneumoboots in place.

Her vital signs show atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), and her blood pressure is controlled with ativan prn. Her respiratory rate is increased, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 40%.

Her labs show elevated leukocyte count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate levels. Imaging shows no new findings, and microbiology reports GNR in sputum culture on 2/26.

Plan:
1. Continue ceftazidime for presumed recurrence of VAP.
2. Follow-up sputum culture for"

   to fall
   # Abdominal Pain: Unclear cause. PEG site c/d/i. No exudate. Nontender
   around site.
   - Patient has only had minimal BM for several days which may be
   contributing. No clear indication that PEG is source
   - Small guaiac pos stool yesterday prior to SSE being given, will
   continue to monitor, not grossly bloody
   - Pain control, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been treated with ceftazidime but now has GNR (gram-negative rods) in her sputum, indicating a possible recurrence of VAP. The patient also has anemia, abdominal pain, and a history of coronary artery disease with a stent placement. She is on multiple medications, including anticoagulants, sedatives, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she has a high respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation. Fluid balance shows a net loss of 1,548 mL over 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. Imaging studies show no new findings. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and her treatment plan includes continuing ceftazidime for suspected VAP, attempting tracheostomy collar weaning, and evaluating the need for tracheostomy mask trial."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She was previously treated with ceftazidime for 8 days but now has pseudomonas again in her sputum and is presumed to have a recurrence of VAP. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been weaned off regular insulin when tube feeding (TF) is held. Renal recommendations include hemodialysis tomorrow, aiming for 4 kg as tolerated. The tracheostomy leak is to be fixed in the morning, and the patient will be on a tracheostomy mask through the night. The patient's allergies include heparin agents, unknown; succinylcholine, unknown. The last dose of antibiotics was ceftazidime on 02/28/2023 at 02:41 PM. Other medications include regular insulin and ICU medications.

   GNR in sputum from [**2-26**], rising WBC, restarted on Ceftaz yesterday for ?
   VAP recurrence given increased sputum and short course of antibiotics
   for prior pseudomonas.
   - Continue Ceftaz as likely recurrence of VAP, ceftaz-sensitive in the
   past.  Will give 15 day course of therapy given concern for recurrence
   - F/u sputum cx for speciation and sensitivies as may have resistant
   pathogen after 8 day abx therapy

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU and received invasive ventilation. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including hypothyroidism, anemia, abdominal pain, cardiovascular issues, endocrine problems, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and wound management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of ARDS and pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure. She is currently on tracheostomy ventilation support.

2. Recurrent Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient had a previous episode of VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There is a suspicion of recurrence, and she is being treated with an extended course of antibiotics.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has chronic renal failure and requires hemodialysis. Her kidney function needs close monitoring.

4. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently experiencing acute decompensation. She requires careful management of fluid balance and medication adjustments.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, including hematochezia, bradybasin, and gastritis. Close monitoring of stool output and endoscopic evaluation may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, renal failure on HD, and previous pseudomonas VAP. She is currently experiencing a recurrence of pseudomonas VAP despite being treated with ceftazidime. The patient also has hypoglycemia, low phosphate levels, and requires non-renal TF formulation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 133/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. She has been on HD and has had episodes of hypoglycemia. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's medical history includes gastrointestinal bleeding, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, pneumonia (ventilator-associated), hypoxemia, heart failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on several medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and medications for glucose control and thyroid function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has already experienced an episode of pseudomonas VAP and now shows a recurrence of pseudomonas in her sputum. This indicates that she may not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, pneumonia (ventilator-acquired), hypoxemia, hypotension, heart failure (acute on chronic), and acute renal failure. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition through a PICC line and dialysis catheter. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient has several potential medical complications. These include:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of lower gastrointestinal bleed increases the risk of further bleeding events.
2. Hypothyroidism: The patient's existing hypothyroidism may contribute to various complications such as cardiovascular issues, metabolic disturbances, and immunodeficiency.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure can lead to complications like electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, anemia, and increased susceptibility to infections.
4. Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent diagnosis of pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation indicates a risk of respiratory infections and potential worsening of lung function.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may result from underlying lung disease, pneumonia, or heart failure.
6. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure suggests inadequate perfusion to vital organs and may require careful monitoring and management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old with a history of pseudomonas pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and recurrent pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/59 to 134/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is tolerating it well. The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures indicate sensitivity to ceftazidime. The patient's medical history includes chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, COPD, coronary artery disease, obesity, and anxiety. The patient's current plan includes continuing dialysis, physical therapy, and speech/swallow evaluation once the tracheostomy is downsized. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent pseudomonas VAP and ARDS indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The presence of pseudomonas bacteria and the history of previous infections suggest a risk of further infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and previous pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treated with ceftazidime. The patient is currently on a repeat course of antibiotics for presumed VAP, as pseudomonas has been detected in her sputum. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently being weaned off. The patient also has anemia, cardiovascular disease, endocrine issues including glucose control and CKD requiring hemodialysis. Additionally, she has mental status changes, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, liver function abnormalities, abdominal pain, and wounds that require ongoing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely exacerbated by fluid balance and ongoing infection. She needs a full 2-week course of antibiotics due to failure of the initial 8-day course.
2. Anemia: The patient has chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and positive guaiac in stool, indicating ongoing blood loss. Erythropoietin and transfusions are being used to manage her anemia.
3. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). Rate control is being maintained with diltiazem, and digoxin has been discontinued.
4. Endocrine Issues: The patient"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) for renal failure. The patient has been treated with ceftazidime for pseudomonas VAP but has now developed a new sputum culture positive for pseudomonas, indicating a recurrence of VAP. 

The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with coarse breath sounds throughout, rhonchi, suctioned white secretions, and end-expiratory wheezing. She is still on a tracheostomy mask with O2 delivery and has not been extubated. The patient is also at risk for fluid overload due to her ARDS and renal failure.

The patient has a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and anemia, and her stool is guaiac positive. She is receiving epoetin at HD and transfusions for a hematocrit (Hct) level above 23.

Her cardiovascular (CV) history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) with a stent placement. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), which is controlled on diltiazem and ativan.

Endocrine issues include glucose control, as the patient has had several episodes of hypoglycemia. She is being monitored by endocrinology and following recommendations from [Last Name (un) 276].

The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) etiology unknown, and she is on hemodialysis. She recently had a tunneled HD catheter placement and a Foley catheter removal. Her urine output is minimal, and she is on a thrice-weekly hemodialysis schedule.

The patient's mental status is improving, and she is attempting to have sessions with an interpreter for orientation.

Hypernatremia has resolved, and the patient's liver function test (LFT) abnormalities have resolved as well.

Wound care is stable, and the patient continues to follow wound care recommendations.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on Nutren 2.0 nutrition support and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has a PICC line and a dialysis catheter in place. Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP precautions such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and ceftazidime antibiotics.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is being screened for long-term acute care (LTAC) placement."

The patient has a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease requiring regular dialysis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/49 mmHg to 165/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on aerosol-cool tracheal mask. The patient is also on multiple medications including ASA, PPI, epogen, tylenol, diltiazem, SSRI, and chlorhexidine.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is lying in bed, alert, and intermittently responsive to commands. There is a tracheostomy in place, and the patient has distended abdomen with a g-tube. The patient also has pneumoboots in place and is awake, responsive to voice, and trying to phonate.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated platelet count. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels are within normal range. The electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, are also within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- Chief Complaint: ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has been experiencing fatigue and respiratory distress.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an aerosol-cool tracheal mask, and their oxygen saturation is at 97%.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/49 to 165/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and atrial fibrillation as the heart rhythm.
- The patient's weight is 106.4 kg, and they are 66 inches tall.
- Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,171 mL, including 368 mL through the PO and 821 mL through TF. The total output includes 10 mL of blood products and 368 mL of urine.
- The patient is receiving various medications such as ASA, PPI, epogen, tylenol, diltiazem, SSRI, and chlorhexidine.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate levels. The platelet count (Plt) is within normal range. There are also abnormalities in kidney function tests (Cr, TCO2) and electrolyte levels (Na+, K+, Cl-, Mg++, PO4). Other lab results are within normal limits or show no significant changes.
- Microbiology tests indicate the presence of pseudomonas in the blood culture and sputum samples.
- Assessment and plan include ongoing tracheostomy care, management of pseudomonas VAP, and addressing various comorbidities such as ARDS, COPD, CAD, pleural effusions, anxiety, deconditioning, and obesity.
- The patient is tolerating tracheostomy but requires frequent suctioning due to thick secretions. They are also anemic, with a stable Hct, and have a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with diltiazem and ativan.
- The patient has positive fluid balance, and it needs to be managed through dialysis.
- The patient is out of bed as tolerated and is receiving physical therapy.
- The plan includes speech/swallow evaluation and therapy after tracheostomy downsizing.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The presence of pseudomonas in the blood culture and sputum samples indicates an ongoing infection. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and may require more aggressive treatment.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance suggests volume overload. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to congestive heart"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS [**12-24**] PNA, renal failure on HD, and s/p pseudomonas VAP treated with ceftazidime. She is currently experiencing a repeat episode of pseudomonas VAP while on ceftazidime. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and previously had a pseudomonas VAP. She is now showing signs of respiratory failure again, likely exacerbated by fluid overload.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

3. Anemia: The patient has a decreased hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. This could be due to acute blood loss, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, or other causes. Treatment with epoetin and transfusions may be necessary.

4. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's phosphate levels are low, which may be partially due to hemodialysis. Repletion with neutral phosphate is recommended.

5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Her heart rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation.

6. Endocrine Disorders: The patient has poorly controlled glucose levels and requires"

   Ceftaz for repeat course fo pseudomonas VAP (2 weeks).
   #Respiratory failure:
   Originally [**12-24**] ARDS [**12-24**] PNA + volume overload, s/p Pseudomonas VAP
   treated w/ ceftazadime with 8 day course. Resp failure likely
   exacerbated by fluid balance.
   - New sputum culture with P. aeurginosa-sensitive to ceftazidime.  Will
   need full 2 week course of antibiotics since she has failed the 8 day
   course, currently day [**6-5**]
   - HD today for volume overload yesterday, goal was 3-4L removal;
   patient only able to tolerated 2.5 L secondary to hypotension.
   - Cont trach mask- patient tolerating well, decrease Fi02, wean O2 as
   tolerated
   - PMV trial on Monday once patient fitted by S&S
   - Continue OOB as tolerated daily to improve atelectasis
   #Anemia: ACD, guaiac pos stool, history of chronic GIB s/p EGD early in
   this admission just showing gastritis. Epoeitin at HD, transufse for
   hct >23.
   - Stable, increased today
   - Continue to monitor
   # Leukocytosis: Increased WBC today. Patient is still clincially
   improving, afebrile.  Has had increased WBC throughout hospitalization.
   Has been ? of underlying malignancy given increased and decreased WBC,
   though per heme, no need to agressively pursue at this point.
   - Continuing ceftaz for 14 day course as above
   - Added on Diff this morning
   - Can consider rechecked CBC later today

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure on HD, and s/p Pseudomonas VAP. She is currently being treated for a repeat course of pseudomonas VAP with ceftazidime. The patient's respiratory failure is likely exacerbated by fluid balance. Her sputum culture showed P. aeruginosa, which is sensitive to ceftazidime. The patient is tolerating a tracheostomy mask and is being weaned off oxygen. A trial of partial mechanical ventilation (PMV) is planned for Monday once the patient is fitted with suitable settings.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely exacerbated by fluid overload. She has been treated for ARDS and pseudomonas VAP in the past and is currently on a prolonged course of antibiotics.
2. Anemia: The patient has a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and positive guaiac-positive stool. She is receiving epoetin at HD and transfusions for Hct >23.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increased WBC count throughout hospitalization. This may be due to an underlying malignancy or as a response to infection. She is being monitored closely.
4. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). Her"

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and succinylcholine, but the specific allergens are unknown. The patient was previously on ceftazidime, but the last dose was given at 07:15 PM.

24-hour events include hemodialysis (HD) with transient hypotension, resulting in not pushing further. However, the patient's respiratory status improved after HD. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/51 to 166/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight has decreased from 113.3 kg at admission to 79.1 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,152 mL and output of 2,500 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,348 mL.

The patient is receiving aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and has an ABG result of pH 7.29. Physical examination findings are not available. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including dialysis, tracheostomy, and physical therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure with VAP, recent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COPD, CAD, pleural effusions, anxiety, deconditioning, and obesity. Continuous monitoring and management of her respiratory status is crucial.
2. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has developed VAP caused by Pseudomonas bacteria. Proper antibiotic therapy needs to be continued to treat the infection effectively.
3. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, possibly due to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She is receiving erythropoietin (epo) and regular packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions. Monitoring her hemoglobin levels and addressing any potential sources of bleeding are important.
4. Hypophosphatemia: The patient may have hypophosphatemia, possibly due to over-dialysis. Aggressive repletion of phosphate is necessary, and her levels should be closely monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS, pneumonia, renal failure, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. The patient has shown improvement clinically, with stable vital signs and no fever. Her white blood cell count has increased, which is likely due to an underlying malignancy. She is being treated for a repeat course of pseudomonas VAP with ceftazidime. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake of 1,490 mL with an output of 400 mL, resulting in a net retention of 1,090 mL. Her weight has decreased from 113.3 kg at admission to 79.1 kg currently. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, but she has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on aerosol-cool, tracheal mask ventilation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, hypophosphatemia with a phosphate level of 2.2 mg/dL, and hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 8.1 mg/dL. Imaging shows bilateral effusions with probable congestive heart failure and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), pneumonia, renal failure on hemodialysis, and previous pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treated with ceftazidime. She is currently experiencing recurrent pseudomonas VAP despite being on ceftazidime and has shown no improvement. The patient also has fluid overload, atrial fibrillation, hypophosphatemia, anemia, and a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. She is on a prolonged course of antibiotics, undergoing hemodialysis, and receiving various other treatments for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has failed an 8-day course of antibiotics for pseudomonas VAP and now requires a full 14-day course. This increases the risk of treatment failure and further complications.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.
3. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's low phosphate levels may indicate a risk for muscle weakness, cardiac dysfunction, and respiratory distress.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia can contribute to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Chronic Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of further bleeding events and nutritional deficiencies.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a diagnosis of pseudomonas VAP, which is a type of lung infection commonly seen in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. This can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is described as having multifactorial respiratory failure with pseud VAP, recent ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), CAD (coronary artery disease), pleural effusions, anxiety, deconditioning, and obesity. These factors contribute to impaired oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show consistently low systolic and diastolic values, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, fluid loss, or inadequate cardiac output.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, with a stable hematocrit level. This may be attributed to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and the need for regular packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions. The patient is also taking epoetin and sucralfate.

5. Hypophosphatemia: The patient has been improving in terms of their phosphate levels, indicating that their hypophosphatemia is being managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, pneumonia (bacterial, ventilator acquired), and heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and acute renal failure. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 118/46 mmHg to 142/76 mmHg, heart rate between 83 and 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through an aerosol-cool tracheostomy mask.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, along with low potassium and sodium levels. Other lab values, such as glucose and liver enzymes, are within normal limits. The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and stage I buttock ulcers. Neurological assessment is unremarkable.

Plan:

The patient is currently receiving tracheostomy care, enteral nutrition, and appropriate antibiotics for the identified infections. Diuretics have been administered to manage fluid overload and improve heart function. Dialysis catheter placement has been done for renal support. Prophylactic measures include"
