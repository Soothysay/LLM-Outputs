   ASSESSMENT: 75 yo M hx CAD s/p NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin with 1
   day hx generalized fatigue, weakness, poor PO, decreased UOP and found
   to be hypotensive, hypoxemic, with acute on chronic renal failure and
   pancytopenia.
   .
   PLAN:
   .
   ## SIRS: Meets SIRS criteria by leukopenia, hypothermia, and increased
   RR but without obvious source of infection. Patient has acute on
   chronic renal failure, but LFTs at baseline, lactate normal and
   troponin at baseline. Altered mental status may represent end organ
   ischemia, but now improved with hydration. Received 3 L IVF and now BP
   improved on levophed. Broad spectrum antibiotics initiated without
   clear source. CXR with effusions, but no obvious consolidation. UA
   clean. No diarrhea. CNS symptoms resolved. Other possible infectious
   etiologies inclued empyema and SBP. Although Hct at baseline of low
   30s, platelets and wbc are low so DIC must be considered. Lastly,
   adrenal supression could potentially be responsible for hypothermia,
   and hypotension.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn for now as
   patient does have MRSA history
   - Send blood, urine, sputum culture
   - Repeat CXR after hydration to see if pneumonia blossoms
   - Continue levophed with goal MAP above 65
   - follow up random cortisol
   - Diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - Diagnostic/Therapeutic thoracentesis to r/o empyema
   .
   ## Hypoxia: CXR c/w fluid overload including bilateral effusions. No
   clear pneumonia. BNP elevated at 2929 but is actually lower than it was
   last month, and it should be noted patient has Chronic renal failure.
   TTE with preserved systolic function this month. Unlikely CHF given
   normal TTE, and exam without elevated JVP. ABG with supratherapeutic
   oxygen levels. CO2 low so clearly patient is not retaining. Troponin
   elevated, but at baseline and EKG is reassuring. High risk for PE given
   possible malignancy and RLE swelling, but not tachycardic and
   oxygenation improving. CTA not possible in the seting renal failure.
   - Repeat ABG in AM
   - Reduce supplemental oxygen and consider CPAP if necessary to help
   with pulmonary edema
   - Repeat Cardiac enzymes and EKG in AM
   - SQH for ppx
   - therapeutic and diagnostic thoracentesis in AM
   - LENIs given R > L edema and inability to get CTA chest
   .
   ## AMS: Unclear source but may be related to infection. No head CT
   performed in the ED. No meningeal signs on exam, and MS improved since
   arrived inthe ER. Patient also on betablocker with was recently
   increased and could be contributing. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to liver
   disease or possible renal dysfunction.
   - defer CT head for now given improved MS
   - Consider adding lactulose
   - Manage BP as noted above
   - tox screen
   - Correct renal dysfunction as noted below
   - Recheck TFTs, B12
   .
   ## Mixed acid base distrubance: Ph Normal but bicarbonate quite low.
   NAGMA likely due to acute on chronic renal failure. In addition, PaC02
   lower than predicted for metabolic acidosis, so there may be a second
   disturbance of primary repiratory alkalosis due to tachypnea from
   hypoxia.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Repeat lactate
   - UA for ketones
   - Improve oxygenation as noted above
   .
   ## Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Baselien Cr 2.7 and mildly elevated
   at 3, possible from poor po intake and lethargy.
   - Urine lytes
   - Repeat Cr post IVF resucitation
   .
   ## CAD: NSTEMI this month with medical management. No signs of ischemia
   on EKG. TTE with preserved systolic function.
   - Continue asa, statin
   - Betablocker if blood pressure improves in AM
   .
   ## Panctytopenia: Presumed secondary to infection. Not neutropenic.
   Patient does has high suspicion for malignancy, so possible marrow
   involvement.
   - Antibiotics as noted above
   - stat Hct now
   - stool guaiac
   - Repeat CBC in am with differential
   .
   ## Afib: S/p pacer and rate controlled. Anticoagulation contraindicated
   due to GI bleed.
   - Tele
   - Hold betablocker for now given hypotension
   .
   ## ESLD: Cryptogenic vs alcoholic cirrhosis. LFts at baseline. On
   nadolol, but not lactulose or rifaximin. Question whether he would be a
   candidate for these in the future.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - Consider RUQ u/s if uptrending LFTs
   - Consider hepatology c/s in AM

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is weakness. The 24-hour events indicate an increase in levophed dosage and mean arterial pressures above 70. The patient's medical history includes angiodysplasia of the stomach and duodenum with serial cauterization, previous gastrointestinal bleeding, thyroid issues, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary obstruction, prostatitis, and a history of melanoma. The patient also has allergies to certain medications and had an allergic reaction to Aranesp.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/60 to 132/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving norepinephrine at a dose of 0.35 mcg/kg/min. The physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the right base, distant heart sounds, and mild erythema at the left foot. Neurological examination shows alertness and intact cranial nerves.

The lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The blood chemistry shows elevated creatinine, BUN, bilirubin, and liver enzymes. The electrolyte levels are within normal range. The coagulation profile shows a slightly elevated fibrinogen level and D-dimer. The blood cultures, urinalysis, and imaging studies are pending.

","The patient's chief complaint is weakness, and they have a history of angiodysplasia of the stomach and duodenum, gastrointestinal bleeding, and melanoma. They also have a history of urinary obstruction, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostatitis.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple medical complications. The assessment and plan include altered mental status, hypoxemia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), cirrhosis of the liver, chronic renal failure, and pancytopenia.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachypnea. They have decreased breath sounds at the right base, distant heart sounds, and mild erythema at the left foot. Neurologic examination reveals alertness, orientation, and intact cranial nerves.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level but preserved systolic function on echocardiogram.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:
1. SIRS: The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukopenia, hypothermia, and increased respiratory rate. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated without a clear source of infection. Possible infectious etiologies include empyema and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis"

   ASSESSMENT: 75 yo M hx CAD s/p NSTEMI, a. fib not on Coumadin with 1
   day hx generalized fatigue, weakness, poor PO, decreased UOP and found
   to be hypotensive, hypoxemic, with acute on chronic renal failure and
   pancytopenia.
   .
   PLAN:
   .
   ## SIRS: Meets SIRS criteria by leukopenia, hypothermia, and increased
   RR but without obvious source of infection. Patient has acute on
   chronic renal failure, but LFTs at baseline, lactate normal and
   troponin at baseline. Altered mental status may represent end organ
   ischemia, but now improved with hydration. Received 3 L IVF and now BP
   improved on levophed. Broad spectrum antibiotics initiated without
   clear source. CXR with effusions, but no obvious consolidation. UA
   clean. No diarrhea. CNS symptoms resolved. Other possible infectious
   etiologies inclued empyema and SBP. Although Hct at baseline of low
   30s, platelets and wbc are low so DIC must be considered. Lastly,
   adrenal supression could potentially be responsible for hypothermia,
   and hypotension.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn for now as
   patient does have MRSA history
   - Send blood, urine, sputum culture
   - Repeat CXR after hydration to see if pneumonia blossoms
   - Continue levophed with goal MAP above 65
   - follow up random cortisol
   - Diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - Diagnostic/Therapeutic thoracentesis to r/o empyema
   .
   ## Hypoxia: CXR c/w fluid overload including bilateral effusions. No
   clear pneumonia. BNP elevated at 2929 but is actually lower than it was
   last month, and it should be noted patient has Chronic renal failure.
   TTE with preserved systolic function this month. Unlikely CHF given
   normal TTE, and exam without elevated JVP. ABG with supratherapeutic
   oxygen levels. CO2 low so clearly patient is not retaining. Troponin
   elevated, but at baseline and EKG is reassuring. High risk for PE given
   possible malignancy and RLE swelling, but not tachycardic and
   oxygenation improving. CTA not possible in the seting renal failure.
   - Repeat ABG in AM
   - Reduce supplemental oxygen and consider CPAP if necessary to help
   with pulmonary edema
   - Repeat Cardiac enzymes and EKG in AM
   - SQH for ppx
   - therapeutic and diagnostic thoracentesis in AM
   - LENIs given R > L edema and inability to get CTA chest

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He presents with generalized fatigue, weakness, poor oral intake, decreased urine output, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure and pancytopenia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered Mental Status (not delirium)
2. Hypoxemia
3. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)
4. Cirrhosis of the liver
5. Chronic Renal Failure
6. Hypothermia

Potential Medical Complications:

1. SIRS: The patient meets SIRS criteria due to leukopenia, hypothermia, and increased respiratory rate. Without an obvious source of infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. Other possible infectious etiologies include empyema and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

2. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to fluid overload with bilateral effusions seen on chest X-ray. There is no clear pneumonia. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, but lower than last month, and considering the patient's chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF) is unlikely. ABG results show supratherapeutic oxygen levels and low CO2 levels, indicating that the patient is not retaining carbon dioxide"

   hypovolemia initially.  Normal LVEF on recent Echo, CVP now in the
   teens, and levo requirement increased o/n.  UA neg, no clear infiltrate
   on CXR, but may be obscured by large effusion.  ?adrenal insufficiency
   given recent prednisone use.
   - add vasopressin
   - check AM cortisol; if equivocal, will consider starting dex and
   performing [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   - continue vanco/zosyn empirically
   - 2^nd set blood cultures today
   - sputum culture, influenza swab
   - RUQ US for ?localizing pocket to tap to r/out SBP
   - consider repeat TTE if rest of eval above unrevealing
   2. Neuro: altered mental status initially, then, per family, back to
   baseline yesterday, more confused this AM and has hypertonia and
   tremor, unclear if true asterixis.  Bedside US with no localizable
   pocket of ascites to tap.
   - check ammonia level, consider lactulose if more increased confusion
   - non-con head CT
   - RUQ US for ?localizing a pocket of ascites to tap
   3. Hypoxia: most likely due to pulmonary edema/overload given CXR. With
   size of effusions, may not be able to see a clear
   infiltrate, however current abx should cover PNA.  Now off NRB and on
   NC.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for now, f/up cultures at 48 hours
   - LENI

   4. Cirrhosis: holding diuretics while pt hypotensive
   - ammonia level
   - ?lactulose if MS worse
   5. CAD: recent NSTEMI with demand in a setting of AF/RVR, rates
   reasonable now.  No signs of active ischemia by ECG, trops lower than
   recent levels.
   - off beta blocker due to hypotension

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation, prior gastrointestinal bleed, right pleural effusion, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and a history of melanoma. He presented with generalized fatigue, weakness, and poor oral intake, and was found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. 

The patient has been admitted and requires fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. He has an IJ line placed in the ICU, and his respiratory support has been weaned off from nasal respiratory bypass (NRB) to 4 liters nasal cannula (NC). 

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side posteriorly, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, soft abdomen with no tenderness or distension, and hypertonia in all extremities along with intention tremor. Neurological examination shows altered mental status. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 76 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L, low potassium level of 15 mEq/L, and high magnesium level of 8.2 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with CAD, CRI, cirrhosis, presenting with malaise and found
   to be hypotensive requiring fluids and pressor support
   1. Hypotension: initial concern for sepsis/SIRS, ? mild component of
   hypovolemia initially.  Normal LVEF on recent Echo, CVP now in the
   teens, and levo requirement increased o/n.  UA neg, no clear infiltrate
   on CXR, but may be obscured by large effusion.  ?adrenal insufficiency
   given recent prednisone use.
   - add vasopressin
   - check AM cortisol; if equivocal, will consider starting dex and
   performing [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   - repeat TFTs
   - continue vanco/zosyn empirically
   - 2^nd set blood cultures today
   - sputum culture, influenza swab
   - RUQ US for ?localizing pocket to tap to r/out SBP
   - consider repeat TTE if rest of eval above unrevealing
   2. Neuro: altered mental status initially, then, per family, back to
   baseline yesterday, more confused this AM and has hypertonia and
   tremor, unclear if true asterixis.  Bedside US with no localizable
   pocket of ascites to tap.
   - check ammonia level, consider lactulose if more increased confusion
   - non-con head CT
   - RUQ US for ?localizing a pocket of ascites to tap
   3. Hypoxia: most likely due to pulmonary edema/overload given CXR. With
   size of effusions, may not be able to see a clear
   infiltrate, however current abx should cover PNA.  Now off NRB and on
   NC.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for now, f/up cultures at 48 hours
   - LENI
s due to asymmetrical legs
   4. Cirrhosis: holding diuretics while pt hypotensive
   - ammonia level
   - ?lactulose if MS worse
   5. CAD: recent NSTEMI with demand in a setting of AF/RVR, rates
   reasonable now.  No signs of active ischemia by ECG, trops lower than
   recent levels.
   - off beta blocker due to hypotension
   - cont ASA and statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation, previous gastrointestinal bleed, right pleural effusion, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and a history of melanoma. He presented with generalized fatigue, weakness, poor oral intake, and was found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for shock and requires fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial concern for sepsis/SIRS is still present, along with a possibility of mild hypovolemia. Normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on recent echocardiogram and central venous pressure (CVP) in the teens suggest adequate fluid resuscitation. However, the increased requirement of vasopressors indicates ongoing hypotension. The possibility of adrenal insufficiency is considered due to recent prednisone use. 
   - Add vasopressin.
   - Check AM cortisol; if equivocal, will consider starting dex and performing [Last Name (un)] stim.
   - Repeat thyroid function tests (TFTs).
   - Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam empirically.
   - Repeat blood cultures today.
   - Sputum culture and influenza swab.
   - Consider repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (T"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with CAD, CRI, cirrhosis, presenting with malaise and found
   to be hypotensive requiring fluids and pressor support
   1. Hypotension: initial concern for sepsis/SIRS, ? mild component of
   hypovolemia initially.  Normal LVEF on recent Echo, CVP now in the
   teens, and levo requirement increased o/n.  UA neg, no clear infiltrate
   on CXR, but may be obscured by large effusion.  ?adrenal insufficiency
   given recent prednisone use.
   - add vasopressin
   - check AM cortisol; if equivocal, will consider starting dex and
   performing [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   - repeat TFTs
   - continue vanco/zosyn empirically
   - 2^nd set blood cultures today
   - sputum culture, influenza swab
   - RUQ US for ?localizing pocket to tap to r/out SBP
   - consider repeat TTE if rest of eval above unrevealing
   2. Neuro: altered mental status initially, then, per family, back to
   baseline yesterday, more confused this AM and has hypertonia and
   tremor, unclear if true asterixis.  Bedside US with no localizable
   pocket of ascites to tap.
   - check ammonia level, consider lactulose if more increased confusion
   - non-con head CT
   - RUQ US for ?localizing a pocket of ascites to tap
   3. Hypoxia: most likely due to pulmonary edema/overload given CXR. With
   size of effusions, may not be able to see a clear
   infiltrate, however current abx should cover PNA.  Now off NRB and on
   NC.
   - continue vanco/zosyn for now, f/up cultures at 48 hours
   - LENI
s due to asymmetrical legs
   4. Cirrhosis: holding diuretics while pt hypotensive
   - ammonia level
   - ?lactulose if MS worse
   5. CAD: recent NSTEMI with demand in a setting of AF/RVR, rates
   reasonable now.  No signs of active ischemia by ECG, trops lower than
   recent levels.
   - off beta blocker due to hypotension
   - cont ASA and statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of shock. The patient has a history of NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation, prior gastrointestinal bleed, right pleural effusion, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and a history of melanoma. He was admitted with generalized fatigue, weakness, and poor oral intake, and found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic.

24-hour events include admission from the emergency department, administration of 3.5 liters of normal saline, placement of a central line, weaning off nasal high flow to 4 liters of nasal cannula, and obtaining a history from the patient.

Allergies include Levofloxacin (oral), shellfish, latex, and Darbepoetin Alfa with a known rash.

Infusions include norepinephrine at 0.35 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications are mentioned but not specified. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam on 11/21/2018 at 05:32 AM.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of altered mental status. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/60 to 132/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He is currently critically ill and requires pressor support due to persistent shock, which is presumed to be sepsis. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is experiencing myoclonus episodes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/63 to 136/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 68%. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg and requires vasopressin and levophed to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP).

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is no clear infectious source identified yet. The neurology team believes that some of the myoclonus episodes may be physiologic, but given the altered mental status (AMS) and lack of a clear infectious source, a lumbar puncture (LP) has been planned.

The patient also has moderate ascites, which was detected through an abdominal ultrasound. He has an elevated ammonia level, which suggests hepatic encephalopathy, and his NG tube has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical complications. The patient has been experiencing worsening delirium, encephalopathy, hypotension, and renal failure. The patient also has a history of liver cirrhosis and elevated ammonia levels, which may indicate hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia levels suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which is a potential complication of liver cirrhosis. This condition can cause confusion, altered mental status, and myoclonus.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukopenia raise concerns for sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal failure and non-oliguric urine output indicate a potential for acute kidney injury. This can be due to various factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or medications.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels suggest hypoxemia. This can be caused by respiratory issues or cardiac dysfunction.

5. Myoclonus: The patient's presence of myoclonus (sudden muscle"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint and HPI are not mentioned in the provided progress note. However, there are several sections that provide important information about the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Under 24-hour events, it is important to note any significant events or changes that occurred during this time period. Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications should be documented as well.

The review of systems section will provide information on any new or worsening symptoms since admission. This can help identify any potential medical complications or areas of concern.

The flowsheet data section includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings. These details are crucial in assessing the patient's current condition and any potential medical complications.

The labs/radiology section includes various test results such as WBC (white blood cell count), Hct (hematocrit), Plt (platelet count), Cr (creatinine), Troponin T, TCO2 (total carbon dioxide), Glucose (blood sugar), and ECG (electrocardiogram). These results can provide valuable information about the patient's organ function and overall health status.

Assessment and plan, ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis (such as DVT and VAP), communication, code status, and disposition are also important sections that provide information about the patient's ongoing care and treatment.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis of the liver, chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.5°C, blood pressure ranging from 115/56 to 133/70 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation but not on supplemental oxygen.

The patient underwent paracentesis and lumbar puncture, with the latter being performed due to suspected toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. The patient also had difficulty with NG tube placement due to a large blood clot, and a family meeting was held to discuss code status and end-of-life decisions. The patient's granddaughter reported that the patient's girlfriend was present and requested testing for sexually transmitted infections.

The patient has allergies to Levofloxacin, shellfish, and Darbepoetin Alfa. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, and Ampicillin.

The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating within normal range.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's inability to assess certain vital signs and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), cirrhosis, pleural effusions, fatigue, weakness, hypoxemia, hypotension, pancytopenia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient meets the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to leukopenia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) shows no consolidation but is limited by pleural effusions. Urine analysis (UA) is clean, but there is no left shift on the complete blood count (CBC). Non-infectious etiologies such as hypoadrenalism and hypothyroidism are possible causes of the patient's symptoms. Borderline [**Last Name (un)**] stim and normal free T4 levels suggest this possibility. The patient is currently on pressor support, which is being weaned as tolerated. Blood cultures have been ordered, along with stress dose steroids. 

The patient also has altered mental status (AMS), which has been stable this morning but still presents with diffuse myoclonic jerks. The patient is at risk for toxic/metabolic encephalopathy given the presence of renal failure and cirrhosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head has been performed, which was negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and cirrhosis. He presented with fatigue, weakness, and hypoxemia, and was found to have hypotension, pancytopenia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient meets SIRS criteria due to leukopenia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. No focus of infection has been identified, and cultures have been sent. Stress dose steroids have been given, and pressors are being weaned as tolerated. A paracentesis was performed, and the patient's granddaughter reported that the patient's girlfriend had been bragging about her. The patient's NG tube placement was difficult due to a large blood clot, and his history of [**Last Name (LF) 10094**], [**First Name3 (LF)**] declined further attempts. The patient's mental status has improved with lactulose. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/56 mmHg to 133/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished radial and digital pulses on the right side, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination is not assessed. Laboratory results"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, pleural effusions, fatigue, weakness, and hypoxemia. He was found to have hypotension, pancytopenia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient meets SIRS criteria due to leukopenia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. No focus of infection has been identified yet. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he is at risk for toxic/metabolic encephalopathy given his renal failure and cirrhosis. He has diffuse myoclonic jerks but a CT head is negative. The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to infection. His renal function remains stable but is worsening, with a creatinine level of 3.4. He also has chronic renal failure with mixed acid-base derangement. The patient's liver function tests are stable, and he is not on lactulose or rifaximin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient may struggle to adapt to his current medical condition and the ICU environment.
2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's fluctuating mental status and myoclonic jerks indicate a potential neurological issue.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels require close monitoring and management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, and pleural effusions. He presents with fatigue, weakness, hypoxemia, hypotension, pancytopenia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient meets SIRS criteria due to leukopenia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started. The patient is being treated with stress dose steroids and pressors have been weaned off since this morning. He has been diagnosed with AMS, likely toxic/metabolic in origin, and is at risk for toxic/metabolic encephalopathy given his renal failure and cirrhosis. The patient's pancytopenia is likely secondary to infection, which has improved. His acute on chronic renal failure is likely a component of ATN due to profound hypotension on admission. Renal dosing of medications and close monitoring of electrolytes are recommended. The patient's cirrhosis has been noted, and he is on lactulose and rifaximin. He is currently on full code status and will remain in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his hypotension, pancytopenia, and positive SIRS criteria. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), cirrhosis, and pleural effusions presenting with fatigue, weakness, and hypoxemia. The patient also has hypotension, pancytopenia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to leukopenia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. The lack of identified infection focus suggests a possible non-infectious cause, but further investigation is needed.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and presents with myoclonic jerks, which may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose has been prescribed to manage this condition.

3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's renal function has worsened, with creatinine levels remaining at 3 from baseline 2.7. This could indicate hepatorenal syndrome, especially considering the patient's cirrhosis.

4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of a large blood clot during attempted nasogastric tube placement raises concerns about an underlying upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is warranted.

5. Pneumonia: The patient's pleural effusions may be associated with pneumonia, especially considering the hypoxemia. Cult"

   75 yo M with h/o CAD, Afib, Cirrhosis, pleural effusions p/w fatigue,
   weakness and found to have hypoxemia, hypotension, pancytopenia and
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   # SIRS/Hypotension: Meets SIRS by leukopenia, hypotension and increasd
   RR. WBC now improved. CXR without consolidation but limited in the
   setting of effusions. UA clean. However, no left shift on CBC. LP
   benign except for elevated protein which is nonspecific. C diff
   negative. Crypto negative. HIV and RPR pending. Noninfectious
   etiologies could include hypoadrenalism and hypothroidism, but T4 and
   cortisol normal. Pressors off since this morning.
   - F/U cultures
 blood, urine, sputum
   - Stress Dose steroids for now
   - para to r/o SBP today
   - [**Female First Name (un) 231**] in the next few days for diagnosis/therapeutic
   # AMS: Improved this morning. CT head negative and exam nonfocal. Neuro
   thinks likely toxic/metabolic. EEG requested. At risk for
   toxic/metabolic given renal failure and cirrhosis.
   - f/u EEG
   -  lactulose
   - f/u RPR, HIV
   -  appreiciate neurology input
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely from infection given acute nature. Now improved.
   -Diff
   -Hemolysis labs
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr remains above 3 from baseline 2.7.
   Feurea 33.4, so looks mixed.  Slightly worse this am but UOP still good
   but lytes and acid base status starting to become more deranged.
   - Trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Renal C/S tomorrow if not improving
   .
   # Cirrhosis: LFTs baseline. Not on lactulose on rifaximin.
   - para to r/o SBP
   - lactulose as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, and pleural effusions. He presented with fatigue, weakness, and hypoxemia, and was found to have pancytopenia, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's SIRS criteria are met due to leukopenia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. His WBC count has improved, but he still has an elevated CRP. The patient's HIV and RPR tests are pending. He has been started on stress dose steroids and will be followed up with cultures, an EEG, and a paracentesis to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's acute mental status changes are likely due to toxic/metabolic causes. His pancytopenia is improving, but he still requires further evaluation. The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is worsening, and he is at risk for hepatorenal syndrome. His cirrhosis is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, and is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and coronary artery disease, who presented to the ICU with hypotension. His infectious workup has been negative to date, and he is currently off pressors. The patient's medical history includes a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and chronic renal failure. 

The patient attempted paracentesis but was unsuccessful, and an interventional radiology-guided paracentesis is planned. He also had a lumbar puncture due to myoclonic jerks, which showed normal glucose levels and no signs of infection. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/53 mmHg to 133/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's physical examination revealed trace lower extremity edema, and his laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can present with altered mental status.
2. Infection: Despite negative infectious workup, the patient is still at risk for developing infections due to his"

","The patient is a 73-inch male who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver, chronic renal failure, and unknown allergies. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), Aranesp injection (darbepoetin alfa), and others.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/43 to 82/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced, and central venous pressure is 13 mmHg.

The patient has received various infusions and antibiotics over the past few days. The flow sheet data shows fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. The patient is not on respiratory support, and oxygen delivery is via none.

The patient's physical examination reveals an unassessed peripheral vascular status, not assessed skin, and not assessed neurologic status. 

Laboratory results show abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, glucose, creatinine, troponin T, and others. The assessment and plan include altered mental status, hypoxemia, SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), cirrhosis of the liver, hypotension, renal failure, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and cirrhosis. He presented with fatigue, weakness, hypoxemia, hypotension, pancytopenia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's condition has been improving, but there are still concerns about potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to leukopenia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis and may be at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose has been initiated, and other measures are being taken to manage this condition.

3. Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status and myoclonus have improved, but there is still a concern for toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure and cirrhosis. An EEG has been requested, and other supportive measures are being implemented.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin are being used.

5. Stress ulcers: The patient is on stress ulcer"

   sepsis without known etiology with plan for 7 day course if no clear
   source found
   - D/c Ampicillin given normal CSF which was initially started for
   listeria coverage
   # AMS: Improved this morning. CT head negative and exam nonfocal. Neuro
   thinks likely toxic/metabolic.  At risk for toxic/metabolic given renal
   failure and cirrhosis.   RPR, HIV and VL neg.  Neuro no longer wants
   EEG.
   - f/u EEG
   - lactulose
   - appreciate neurology input
   # Pancytopenia: Likely from infection given acute nature. Now improved.
   DIC labs negative.  ?MDS.
   - CBC with diff daily
   - heme onc eval
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Cr remains above 3 from baseline 2.7.
   Feurea 33.4, so looks mixed.  Likely a component of ATN given profound
   hypotension on admission.
   - Renally dose mediations
   - urine lytes, renal ultrasound
   - renal consult
   # Cirrhosis: LFTs baseline. Not on lactulose on rifaximin at baseline.
   [**Last Name (un) **] with low protein, neg gram stain.
   - will likely benefit from SBP prophylaxis
   - lactulose as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, and pleural effusions. He presented with fatigue, weakness, and hypoxemia, and was found to have hypotension, pancytopenia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient meets SIRS criteria due to leukopenia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. His WBC count has improved. The chest X-ray shows no consolidation but is limited by the presence of effusions. The urinalysis is clean, and there is no left shift on the complete blood count. The lumbar puncture is benign except for elevated protein levels. C. difficile and cryptococcal tests are negative, and HIV and RPR results are pending. Noninfectious causes such as hypoadrenalism and hypothyroidism are considered but T4 and cortisol levels are normal. Pressors have been turned off since this morning. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to sepsis without a known etiology. There is a risk of developing further infections due to immunosuppression.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis and elevated ammonia levels, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's acute-on-chronic renal"
