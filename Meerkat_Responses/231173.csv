   Ms. [**Known lastname 3007**] is a 54 yo F with PMH sarcoidosis, tracheostomy [**3-14**] upper
   airway obstruction, dCHF, DM1, pulmonary HTN, CAD, morbid obesity
   presenting with dyspnea, nausea and vomiting.
   .
   #Dyspnea - etiology unclear however ddx most likely pneumonia vs
   tracheobronchitis vs PE.  Aspiration pneumonia also possible given that
   she is also vomiting and has poor mobility.  Sputum cx from last
   admission with two colonies of pseudomonas, one sensitive to zosyn
   other with intermed sensi to zosyn.  Her CXR was consistent with
   pulmonary edema on repeat examination..  She does not have any h/o DVT
   or PE in the past despite multpile admissions for dyspnea.  In
   addition, her partner reports a slower onset of symptoms with a
   productive cough.  Of note, after suctioning she did have frank blood,
   possibly [**3-14**] trauma from suctioning.

   #Hemoptysis - unclear etiology, possibly [**3-14**] trauma from suctioning vs
   underlying sarcoid lung disease. Vs new trach collar placement
   -resolved, CT chest with no concern for pulmonary hemorrhage
   .
   #.Nausea, vomiting - most likely due to migraine headache and
   gastroparesis.  Possibly also related to possible UTI on review of
   records she has had n/v with UTI in the past.  Cardiac ischemia also
   possible given her known CAD.  Other consideration incarcerated hernia
   given that the hernia site is firm to palpation and she is reporting
   increased tenderness at the site.
   -CT showed small bowel hernia
   - reducible on exam today, surgery following
   .
   #Urinary Tract Infection - UA on admission c/w UTI vs contamination
   from chronic foley, concern for possiblility that UA was not full
   treated on last admission as zosyn was not included on D/C medications.
   -antibiotics as above

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy, upper airway obstruction, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and morbid obesity.
- The patient was admitted with complaints of dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.
- The patient's dyspnea etiology is unclear, but possible causes include pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient had a previous sputum culture that showed two colonies of Pseudomonas, with one being sensitive to zosyn and the other with intermediate sensitivity.
- The patient's chest X-ray showed findings consistent with pulmonary edema.
- The patient does not have a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE.
- The patient's partner reported a slower onset of symptoms with a productive cough.
- After suctioning, the patient had frank blood, possibly due to suctioning trauma.
- The patient's hemoptysis may be related to trauma from suctioning or underlying sarcoid lung disease.
- The patient's nausea and vomiting may be due to a migraine headache, gastroparesis, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), or cardiac ischemia.

Ms. [Known Lastname 3007] is a 54-year-old female patient with a medical history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy (3-14), upper airway obstruction, dCHF, DM1, pulmonary HTN, CAD, and morbid obesity. The patient presents with dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and had a percutaneous tracheostomy performed on [2191-5-16] at 12:08 PM. An ultrasound was also done on the same day. The patient's trach was changed to a 6.0 cuffed Portex trach. A repeat chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, for which lasix 40mg IV was administered. Blood pressure control was achieved with 20mg IV labetalol, lasix 40mg, morphine, and MAP 60s. The patient's oxygen saturation was 99% on pressure support, PEEP 5, PS 15. A CT scan revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis and small bowel incarceration. Surgery consultation was obtained, and no acute surgical issue was identified.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy, upper airway obstruction, congestive heart failure (dCHF), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has a tracheostomy and was placed on invasive ventilation due to upper airway obstruction. The patient's recent chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, but this finding is inconsistent with her current B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and clinical examination. The patient also has a history of aspiration pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to zosyn (cefepime). 

The patient's sudden onset of dyspnea raises concern for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), especially given her risk factors of morbid obesity and limited mobility. However, her partner reports a slower onset of symptoms with a productive cough, suggesting an alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia or tracheobronchitis. The presence of frank blood after suctioning may indicate trauma from suctioning or underlying lung disease, such as sarcoidosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 1, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and morbid obesity. She presented with dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath, hemoptysis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and a possible incarcerated hernia. Her previous sputum culture showed two colonies of Pseudomonas, one sensitive to zosyn and the other with intermediate sensitivity. A chest X-ray indicated pulmonary edema, and a CT scan showed no signs of pneumonia. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and transitioned from positive pressure ventilation to tracheostomy mask with good oxygen saturations. She was previously on antibiotics but they were discontinued as there was no evidence of infiltrate on CT chest. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she has been given various medications including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, such as an elevated white blood cell count and D-dimer levels, while other values are within normal range. The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals absent pulses in both radial and dorsal pedal arteries. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state. The patient's skin examination is also not"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 1, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and morbid obesity. She was admitted with dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and hemoptysis.

The assessment and plan include:
- Dyspnea: Etiology unclear, but possible pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pulmonary embolism, or aspiration pneumonia. Sputum culture sent.
- Hemoptysis: Unclear etiology, possibly trauma from suctioning or underlying sarcoid lung disease. Resolved with CT chest showing no concern for pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Nausea and vomiting: Most likely due to migraine headache and gastroparesis. Also, possible UTI or cardiac ischemia.
- Urinary tract infection: UA on admission c/w UTI vs contamination from chronic foley. Follow-up urine culture with GNR.
- Headache: Sx consistent with migraine.
- Type I Diabetes: Increased Lantus 38 units qhs.
- CAD: Ruled out ACS. Continue BB and statin. Hold ASA and Plavix given potential for procedures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hemoptysis, along with the presence of risk factors such as poor mobility and a previous sputum culture positive for pseudomonas."

   presenting with dyspnea, nausea and vomiting.

   #Dyspnea - etiology unclear however ddx most likely pneumonia vs
   tracheobronchitis vs PE.  Aspiration pneumonia also possible given that
   she is also vomiting and has poor mobility.  Sputum cx from last
   admission with two colonies of pseudomonas, one sensitive to zosyn
   other with intermed sensi to zosyn.  Her CXR was consistent with
   pulmonary edema on repeat examination..  She does not have any h/o DVT
   or PE in the past despite multpile admissions for dyspnea.  In
   addition, her partner reports a slower onset of symptoms with a
   productive cough.  Of note, after suctioning she did have frank blood,
   possibly [**3-14**] trauma from suctioning.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. Her hypoxemia and
   dyspnea are improved. Her trach will be changed back to a cuffless
   one.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and morbid obesity. She presents with dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and hemoptysis.

The patient's dyspnea could have multiple etiologies including pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pulmonary embolism (PE), or aspiration pneumonia due to her poor mobility and vomiting. The sputum culture from her previous admission showed two colonies of Pseudomonas, one sensitive to zosyn and the other with intermediate sensitivity. Her chest X-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema, and she has no history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE. Her partner reports a productive cough with slower onset of symptoms.

The patient had frank blood possibly due to suctioning trauma. The CT chest findings were not concerning for pneumonia, so she was taken off antibiotics. The tracheostomy tube size will be changed to a 6 uncuffed tracheostomy tube.

The patient's hemoptysis could be related to trauma from suctioning, underlying sarcoid lung disease, or new tracheostomy collar placement. However, the CT chest showed no concern for pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient's nausea and vomiting are most likely due to a migraine headache and gastropares"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 3007], a 54-year-old female with a medical history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy (3-14), upper airway obstruction, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and morbid obesity, was admitted to the ICU with complaints of dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. She also presented with hemoptysis, which was initially unclear in etiology but later resolved. The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) that was suspected due to a positive urine analysis on admission, and she underwent a change in Foley catheter. Additionally, she had a small bowel hernia that was identified on CT scan, which was reducible and planned for surgery. The patient's nausea and vomiting were likely related to migraines and gastroparesis. Her diabetes management involved increasing the dose of Lantus insulin at bedtime. There were concerns about possible cardiac ischemia due to her known CAD, but this was ruled out. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's dyspnea may be due to pneumonia, considering her risk factors such as poor mobility and previous sputum culture showing pseudomonas.
2. Tracheobronchitis: Inflammation of the trache"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 1, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and morbid obesity. She was admitted to the ICU with complaints of dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.

On review of systems, the patient has unchanged review of systems except for the following:

1. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to a migraine headache and gastroparesis. Other possible causes include cardiac ischemia or an incarcerated hernia at the surgical site. A CT scan showed a small bowel hernia that was reducible on examination. Surgery was planned for the incarcerated hernia.

2. Dyspnea (Shortness of Breath): The etiology of the dyspnea is unclear, but possible causes include pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pulmonary embolism (PE), or aspiration pneumonia given the patient's poor mobility and vomiting. The patient had a previous sputum culture that showed two colonies of Pseudomonas, with one being sensitive to Zosyn and the other having intermediate sensitivity. The chest X-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema. However, a CT chest showed no concerning findings for pneumonia, so antibiotics were stopped. The patient will continue on guaifenesin, and sputum culture results are pending. Flovent, albuterol, and"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of sarcoidosis, tracheostomy, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 1, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and morbid obesity. She was admitted with dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. The patient's dyspnea may be caused by pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pulmonary embolism, or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, and her sputum culture revealed two colonies of pseudomonas, with one being sensitive to zosyn and the other having intermediate sensitivity. The patient does not have a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The patient's partner reported a productive cough with a slower onset of symptoms. The patient experienced frank blood possibly due to suctioning trauma. The CT chest findings were not concerning for pneumonia. The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to migraine headache, gastroparesis, cardiac ischemia, or an incarcerated hernia. A CT scan showed a small bowel hernia, which was reducible on examination and will require surgery. The patient had a urinary tract infection, and her Foley catheter was changed. The patient also has a history of type 1 diabetes and coronary artery disease. The attending physician agrees with the assessment and plan."
