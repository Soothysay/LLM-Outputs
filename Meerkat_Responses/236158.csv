","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD) s/p angioplasty, and multiple vascular bypass procedures. The patient presents with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress.

The assessment includes pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient has leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, hypotension, and fevers. The likely source of infection is multifocal pneumonia, with consolidations seen on the chest X-ray in the left mid and right lower lungs. Legionella pneumonia is also considered due to gastrointestinal complaints.

The plan involves aggressive fluid resuscitation and dopamine for hypotension. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started with levofloxacin/ceftriaxone/vancomycin for CAP, considering the concern for flu and MRSA pneumonia superimposed. Tamiflu has been given for influenza, and follow-up flu swab is ordered. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are also indicated.

For respiratory failure, the patient has likely COPD due to a long smoking history. The CXR shows bilateral opacities, and the patient was intubated for respiratory failure in the emergency department. Wheezes and tightness on examination suggest pneumonia with COPD exacerbation. The goal is to wean FiO2 and increase P"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presented with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. She was intubated in the emergency department due to respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events include the initiation of invasive ventilation, multi-lumen placement, nasal swab for MRSA, arterial line placement, and administration of antibiotics and antivirals.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 58 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/51 to 135/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with supplemental oxygen.

The patient has a history of COPD and her chest X-ray shows bilateral opacities. She has leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and fevers. There are concerns for multifocal pneumonia, including possible Legionella pneumonia given her gastrointestinal complaints. The patient requires dopamine for hypotension and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

The plan includes central venous line placement, IV fluids to maintain CVP between 8-12, blood transfusion for hematocrit > 30, IV fluid boluses and dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure > 65 and urine output > 30cc/hr. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous angioplasty and multiple vascular bypass procedures. The patient presents with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions:

1. Sepsis Shock: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), elevated lactate levels, hypotension, and fevers. The likely source of infection is multifocal pneumonia. Legionella pneumonia is also considered due to gastrointestinal complaints and the presence of consolidations on the chest X-ray. The patient required pressors and intravenous fluids but now has improved blood pressure. Urine legionella test was negative, and there is no evidence of abdominal infection on examination.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from a long smoking history. The chest X-ray shows bilateral opacities, and the patient was intubated for respiratory failure in the emergency department. The patient has wheezing and tightness on examination, indicating a likely pneumonia with COPD exacerbation. The patient is requiring additional FiO2 overnight to maintain oxygenation.

3. Metabolic Acidosis-Non gap: The patient has an elevated lactate level and no ketones in the urine, suggesting a non-gap metabolic acidosis."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The note indicates that the patient has pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and is receiving appropriate antibiotics. The patient also has electrolyte and fluid disorders, including increased central venous pressure (CVP) and volume overload, which will be addressed through diuresis. Additionally, the patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to the ongoing pneumonia, further deterioration of renal function, and potential cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU, with ongoing assessment of vital signs, oxygenation, and fluid balance. Frequent lab tests should be conducted to monitor electrolyte levels, renal function, and cardiac enzymes. The patient's response to antibiotics should be closely evaluated, and adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary based on culture data.

Continuous sedation and pain management will be required to ensure patient comfort. Regular communication with the family regarding the patient's progress and any changes in the plan of care is essential.

Overall, this patient requires a multidisciplinary approach involving critical care specialists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, and other relevant healthcare professionals to manage their complex medical condition and prevent potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been relatively stable over the past 24 hours, with some fluctuations in oxygen saturation and ventilation settings. He is currently on lasix drip for persistent hypertension and bradycardia, and his head was scanned due to persistent hypertension and bradycardia, with preliminary results being negative. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/59 mmHg to 122/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. His temperature is within normal range. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, with fluid balance showing an intake of 1,400 mL and output of 3,245 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,845 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and hydralazine.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished and overweight-obese appearance, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, trace lower extremity edema, and soft non-tender abdomen. The patient's neurologic assessment is incomplete due to int"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 68 year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, CAD
   s/p angioplasty, multiple vascular bypass procedures who presents with
   pneumonia, hypotension and respiratory distress, worsening overnight
   Plan:
   #. Respiratory Failure / ARDS: Pt with likely COPD from long smoking
   history.  CXR shows b/l opacities.  Pt intubated for respiratory
   failure in the ED.  Pt with +wheezes and tight on exam.  Likely
   pneumonia with COPD exacerbation.  Although initially improving O2
   requirement, since 3am sudden decompensation. Although still achieving
   O2 sat >02%, FIO2 requirement has increased in spite of adequate
   diuresis.
   - PNA aggressively treated with Vanco / Levoflox / Ceftriaxone, on day
   3 today. No evidence of flu, Chest xray unchanged, unlikely to be
   worsening infection given broad spectrum and lack of fever / WBC
   - Continue lasix drip, goal -200cc / hr, unlikely for volume overload
   to be driving hypoxia
   - We have used low PEEP, plateu pressures in 20
s, no evidence of auto
   peep or stacking
   - Increase PEEP, FIO2, goal PaO2 ~80 to avoid hypoxic vasoconstriction
   - Patient synchronous with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not suspect this is contributing
   - Ongoing treatment with IV solumedrol for COPD exacerbation
   - Round the clock inhalers
   - Given desaturation with turning, suspect V/Q mismatch
   - Patient may require bronchoscopy for further evaluation.
   # Septic Shock
 Resolved, patient has been hypertensive in the  past
   24hrs. On admission patient with leukocytosis, elevated lactate,
   hypotension and fevers. Likely source is multifocal pneumonia.  UA was
   negative. Urine legionella negative. No evidence of abdominal infection
   on exam.  Flu neg.
   - Central venous line in place
   - Goal CVP 8-12;
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with levofloxacin/CTX/Vancomycin (CAP,
   but given concern for flu considering MRSA pneumonia superimposed); day
   #2 [**1-13**]
   - d/c
d Tamiflu given neg flu
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum culture

   #Metabolic Acidosis- Resolved with diuresis
   #DM: ISS. Pt given steroids so will closely monitor sugars.
   .
   #. CAD: No evidence of active ischemia. CE neg and ECG negative.
   - ECHO with new inferior wall motion abnormality
   - cont ASA
   - holding BB
   .
   #. HTN: Starting HCTZ to augment diuresis, also started Hydralazine
   overnight, goal SBP 120-140 to avoid episodes of pulmonary edema

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and previous angioplasty and bypass procedures. She presented with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, worsening overnight. The patient was intubated for respiratory failure in the emergency department and has likely COPD due to her long smoking history. Chest X-ray shows bilateral opacities, indicating pneumonia with a possible COPD exacerbation. Despite initial improvement, the patient experienced sudden decompensation at 3 am, with increasing oxygen requirements despite adequate diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure / ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern, as indicated by the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. The worsening oxygen requirements and bilateral opacities on the chest X-ray suggest the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis Shock: The patient had signs of sepsis, including leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, hypotension, and fevers. Although the source of infection seems to have resolved, there is still a risk of septic shock due to the patient's underlying conditions.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had resolved metabolic acidosis, which could be attributed to the diuresis.
4. Diabetic Issues: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, and close monitoring of blood sugar levels is necessary due to the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 68 year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, CAD
   s/p angioplasty, multiple vascular bypass procedures who presents with
   pneumonia, hypotension and respiratory distress, worsening overnight
   Plan:
   #. Respiratory Failure / ARDS: Pt with likely COPD from long smoking
   history.  CXR shows b/l opacities.  Likely pneumonia with COPD
   exacerbation.  Although initially improving O2 requirement, since 3am
   sudden decompensation. Although still achieving O2 sat >02%, FIO2
   requirement has increased in spite of adequate diuresis.
   - PNA aggressively treated with Vanco / Levoflox / Ceftriaxone, on day
   3 today. No evidence of flu, Chest xray unchanged, unlikely to be
   worsening infection given broad spectrum and lack of fever / WBC
   - Continue lasix drip, goal -200cc / hr, unlikely for volume overload
   to be driving hypoxia
   - We have used low PEEP, plateu pressures in 20
s, no evidence of auto
   peep or stacking
   - Increase PEEP, FIO2, goal PaO2 ~80 to avoid hypoxic vasoconstriction
   - Patient synchronous with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not suspect this is contributing
   - Ongoing treatment with IV solumedrol for COPD exacerbation
   - Round the clock inhalers
   - Given desaturation with turning, suspect V/Q mismatch. On admission
   was hypotensive and SOB. No evidence of RV strain on ECHO, but will get
   CTA to r/o PE
   # Septic Shock
 Resolved, patient has been hypertensive in the  past
   24hrs. On admission patient with leukocytosis, elevated lactate,
   hypotension and fevers. Likely source is multifocal pneumonia.  UA was
   negative. Urine legionella negative. No evidence of abdominal infection
   on exam.  Flu neg.
   - Central venous line in place
   - Goal CVP 8-12;
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with levofloxacin/CTX/Vancomycin (CAP,
   but given concern for flu considering MRSA pneumonia superimposed); day
   #2 [**1-13**]
   - d/c
d Tamiflu given neg flu
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum culture
   .
   .
   #Metabolic Acidosis- Resolved with diuresis.
   #DM: ISS. Pt given steroids so will closely monitor sugars.
   .
   #. CAD: No evidence of active ischemia. CE neg and ECG negative.
   - ECHO with new inferior wall motion abnormality
   - cont ASA
   - holding BB
   .
   #. HTN: Holding HCTZ given pt will get contrast, also started
   Hydralazine overnight, goal SBP 120-140 to avoid episodes of pulmonary
   edema

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD) post angioplasty and multiple vascular bypass procedures. She presented with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. She was initially improving but suddenly deteriorated overnight. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increased FiO2 requirement. She has been aggressively treated for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics for fluid overload, and steroids for COPD exacerbation. Other concerns include septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and possible pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's worsening oxygenation despite adequate diuresis suggests a possible development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This can be due to pneumonia with COPD exacerbation.
2. Sepsis: The patient had leukocytosis, elevated lactate, hypotension, and fevers, indicating sepsis, likely secondary to multifocal pneumonia.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had a resolved metabolic acidosis with diuresis. Monitoring of blood sugar levels is necessary due to steroid treatment.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Although the patient's ECG and cardiac enzyme levels were negative for active ischemia, an echocardiogram showed a new inferior wall motion abnormality, suggesting a possible CAD complication.

 Hypoxia/respiratory failure: likely ARDS but CXR much improved still
   with a significant A-a gradient, given intial presentation of
   hypotension and presistant signfiicant A-a gradient should exclude PE
   with CTPE at this point.  Would drop MV today to allow PCO2 to rise,
   wean PEEP as tolerated. Will hold diuresis for today pending this to

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual currently admitted to the ICU. They have been receiving various treatments and medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, and sedatives. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 112/48 to 184/80 mmHg. Oxygen saturation levels have also been monitored, with a current reading of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support, with a set tidal volume of 440 mL and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their temperature is within normal range. They are well-nourished and show no signs of acute distress. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and kidney function parameters. Chest X-ray reveals bilateral small infiltrates in the lungs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia and respiratory failure could potentially lead to further deterioration in lung function, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypertension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure readings indicate uncontrolled hypertension. If left untreated, this could increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.

 HTN: HCTZ d/c, hydralazine SBP 120-140 goal.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: would start bowel regimen.
 Hypoxia/respiratory failure: likely ARDS but CXR much improved still
   with a significant A-a gradient, given intial presentation of
   hypotension and presistant signfiicant A-a gradient should exclude PE
   with CTPE at this point.  Would drop MV today to allow PCO2 to rise,
   wean PEEP as tolerated. Will hold diuresis for today pending this to
   minimize risk of contrast induced nephropathy. WIll give bicarb and
   mucomyst.

   I saw and examined the patient with the pulmonary fellow, the
   assessment and plan was discussed in detail.  I would emphasize the
   following.  Continues off pressors.  Diuresed overnight.  CTA negative
   for PE
 checked given high Fi02 requirements out of proportion to
   CXR.  Albeit there is significant underlying emphysema.
   Moving better air.  Secretions improved.
   Agree with continuing current management as detailed above.  Further
   diuresis as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and multiple vascular bypass procedures. She presents with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for respiratory failure/ARDS, likely due to COPD exacerbation with possible post-obstructive pneumonia. She is also being managed for metabolic acidosis, abdominal discomfort, CAD, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of bilateral opacities on the chest X-ray suggest a high risk for respiratory failure. This can lead to severe hypoxemia and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can progress and cause worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of long-term smoking and the presentation of respiratory distress may indicate a COPD exacerbation. This can lead to increased airway inflammation, bronchospasm, and respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's history of CAD and recent angioplasty make her prone to cardiac complications. These may include acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has resolved metabolic acidosis but may still be at risk for its complications such as renal dysfunction and multi-organ failure"

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   Assesment: This is a 68 year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, CAD
   s/p angioplasty, multiple vascular bypass procedures who presents with
   pneumonia, hypotension and respiratory distress, worsening overnight
   Plan:
   #. Respiratory Failure / ARDS: Pt with likely COPD from long smoking
   history.  CXR shows b/l opacities.  Likely pneumonia with COPD
   exacerbation.  Although initially improving O2 requirement, since 3am
   sudden decompensation. Although still achieving O2 sat >02%, FIO2
   requirement has increased in spite of adequate diuresis.
   - PNA aggressively treated with Vanco / Levoflox / Ceftriaxone, on day
   3 today. No evidence of flu, Chest xray unchanged, unlikely to be
   worsening infection given broad spectrum and lack of fever / WBC
   - Continue lasix drip, goal -200cc / hr, unlikely for volume overload
   to be driving hypoxia
   - We have used low PEEP, plateu pressures in 20
s, no evidence of auto
   peep or stacking
   - Increase PEEP, FIO2, goal PaO2 ~80 to avoid hypoxic vasoconstriction
   - Patient synchronous with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not suspect this is contributing
   - Ongoing treatment with IV solumedrol for COPD exacerbation
   - Round the clock inhalers
   - Given desaturation with turning, suspect V/Q mismatch. On admission
   was hypotensive and SOB. No evidence of RV strain on ECHO, but will get
   CTA to r/o PE
   # Septic Shock
 Resolved, patient has been hypertensive in the  past
   24hrs. On admission patient with leukocytosis, elevated lactate,
   hypotension and fevers. Likely source is multifocal pneumonia.  UA was
   negative. Urine legionella negative. No evidence of abdominal infection
   on exam.  Flu neg.
   - Central venous line in place
   - Goal CVP 8-12;
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with levofloxacin/CTX/Vancomycin (CAP,
   but given concern for flu considering MRSA pneumonia superimposed); day
   #2 [**1-13**]
   - d/c
d Tamiflu given neg flu
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum culture
   .
   #Metabolic Acidosis- Resolved with diuresis.
   #DM: ISS. Pt given steroids so will closely monitor sugars.
   .
   #. CAD: No evidence of active ischemia. CE neg and ECG negative.
   - ECHO with new inferior wall motion abnormality
   - cont ASA
   - holding BB
   .
   #. HTN: Holding HCTZ given pt will get contrast, also started
   Hydralazine overnight, goal SBP 120-140 to avoid episodes of pulmonary

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease who presents with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has a history of smoking and may have COPD exacerbation. She is showing signs of respiratory failure/ARDS with worsening oxygen requirements despite adequate diuresis. The plan is to aggressively treat pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and continue diuresis. 

The patient also has septic shock that has resolved, with previous hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and fevers. The likely source is multifocal pneumonia. 

Other medical issues include metabolic acidosis, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The patient's blood glucose levels will be closely monitored due to steroid treatment. 

The patient has a history of hypertension and is on antihypertensive medication. 

Nutrition is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TF) with high residuals. 

The patient has multiple lines including an arterial line and multi-lumen central venous catheter. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis. 

Code status is full code, and the patient is to be dispositioned to the ICU."

   Attending Note: I saw and examined the patient, and was physically
   present with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10399**] for the key portions of the services provided.
   I agree with the note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   Remains intubated and sedated, FiO2 40%, peep 12, and decreased RR to
   20. Tolerated PSV today before bronch. Off lasix drip today. Had CTA
   yesterday which was negative for PE but revealed a left hilar fullness
   (?mass) and small effusions. Performed bronchoscopy today through ETT.
   There were mucosal nodules, erythematous mucosa, and widening of
   secondary carinas at lingual/LUL. Washings sent for culture, cytology
   and cell count. Son [**Name (NI) **] was updated personally. Additional history is
   that the patient smoked 1 ppd of non-filtered cigarettes for 50 years.
   Agree with narrowing antibiotics to levofloxacin and tapering down
   steroids. For uncontrolled hypertension, agree with adding IV nitro
   until PO meds take effects.
   Patient is full code for now. Family aware that this may be a lung
   cancer. Currently next of [**Doctor First Name **] is patient
s husband though they are
   currently separated. HCP will need to be addressed eventually.
   Critically ill. Time 45 minutes not including bronchoscopy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, smoking for 50 years, and recent symptoms of pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 148/62 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated potassium levels. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 178. The imaging studies reveal stable chest X-ray findings.

The patient's current assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, alteration in nutrition, pneumonia, hypertension, and abdominal pain. The medical team is working towards weaning PEEP, attempting pressure support later today, and planning for a bronchoscopy to further evaluate the left upper lobe infiltrate.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma due to high levels of PEEP. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, which needs to be considered"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress.
- The patient has been treated with Levofloxacin for pneumonia but has shown negative cultures and flu.
- The patient is auto-diuresing and needs to maintain urine output (UOP) goal of 1500cc/hr negative.
- A bronchoscopy was performed, showing abnormal friable cells and nodular areas; bronchial washing was sent for gram stain/culture/cytology/fungal culture/acid-fast bacilli (AFB).
- The patient's blood pressure (BP) remains high despite medication adjustments, and nitroglycerin has been started.
- The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, FiO2 set at 50%, and PEEP at 10 cmH2O.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate (HR) of 74 bpm, BP ranging from 135/60 to 180/75 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 15 insp/min, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%.
- The patient's ABG results show pH 7.40, pCO2 55, pO2 91, HCO3 35, and Ve 10.2 L/min.
- The patient's labs reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 36.2%, platelet count (Plt) of 299 K/uL, and elevated glucose level of 183 mg/dL.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level (K+) of 3.8 mEq/L.
- The patient's nutrition is being provided through Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 30 mL/hour, and glycemic control is maintained with regular insulin sliding scale.
- The patient has multiple lines including a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and a 20-gauge line.
- Prophylactic measures include SQ UF Heparin for DVT, H2 blocker for stress ulcer, and HOB elevation for VAP prevention.
- The patient's restraints need to be reviewed, and code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/ARDS: The patient's history of COPD and recent pneumonia increases the risk of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pneumonia: The patient's current pneumonia treatment with Levofloxacin needs to be monitored closely, especially considering the negative cultures and flu.
3. Hypertension: The patient's persistently high blood pressure requires further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema.
4. Diabetic Complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 increases the risk of various complications including metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD raises concerns about potential cardiac ischemia or worsening of existing coronary artery disease.
6. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent angioplasty and multiple vascular bypass procedures. She was admitted with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. 

The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, with an increase in oxygen requirements. Bronchoscopy showed abnormal friable cells and nodular areas, and bronchial washing was sent for gram stain, culture, cytology, fungal culture, and acid-fast bacilli. The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 0 mL and a plateau pressure (Pplat) of 19 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.40, pCO2 of 55 mmHg, and pO2 of 91. 

Laboratory values indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.9, hematocrit (Hct) of 36.2, platelet count (Plt) of 299,000/mm3, and elevated troponin-T level of 101. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

   just shows [**12-18**]+ polys with no organisms. Cell count with predominantly
   polys, no eos. Cytology pending. Continue diuresis, levofloxacin x 10
   days for [**Month/Day (2) **].
 Probable lung ca: if cytology negative, will likely need repeat
   bronch/TBBx. PET/CT will be helpful to evaluate extent of disease.
   Family aware of CT/bronch findings.
 Hypertension: resume home clonidine, and amlodipine, continue nitro
   IV and hydralazine until BP improves with PO meds.
 Malnutrition: continue TF.
Diarrhea: check C.diff.

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and coronary artery disease, who presents with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 145/67 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on face tent with FiO2 70%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including amlodipine, hydralazine, clonidine, nitroglycerin, famotidine, heparin sodium, and furosemide. She has also been receiving antibiotics such as vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.

Her lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. However, her blood glucose level is elevated at 302 mg/dL. Other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/troponin-T, and differential are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of multiple vascular bypass procedures and presents with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The chest X-ray shows bilateral opacities suggestive of pneumonia. The plan is to decrease PEEP to 5 today"

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and multiple vascular bypass procedures. She was admitted with pneumonia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient has been treated with invasive ventilation, antibiotics, and other medications. She has been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen. The plan includes weaning off oxygen, continuing antihypertensive medication, checking for Clostridium difficile infection, monitoring for metabolic alkalosis, and managing diabetes. The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has likely worsened due to the pneumonia. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure / ARDS: Given the patient's history of COPD and the recent development of pneumonia, there is a risk of respiratory failure progressing to ARDS. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is essential.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be carefully managed to avoid episodes of pulmonary edema. Adjustments in antihypertensive medication may be necessary.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient may have an electrolyte imbalance, particularly with regards to sodium and potassium levels. Close monitoring and correction as needed are important.
4. Alteration in Nutrition"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old individual with COPD, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia, and there is also suspicion of a lung mass. The active issues include refractory hypertension.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/43 mmHg to 178/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving various medications including nitroglycerin, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and others. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,990 mL and output of 3,280 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,290 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a venti mask with standby ventilator mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of 7.48/44/111/36/9.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, distant heart sounds, crackles in the bases of the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and no assessment of the skin, neurologic system, or peripheral pulses.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, platelet count of 315 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 39 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, glucose of 174 mg/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 103 mEq/L, calcium of 9.6 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus of 3.4 mg/dL.

Imaging studies reveal a chest X-ray showing right hilar infiltrate and bilateral effusions. Microbiology tests are negative for Clostridium difficile and respiratory viral antigen screen.

The assessment and plan include the patient's respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation possibly related to pneumonia and underlying malignancy. The plan involves extubation, administration of levofloxacin for 10 days, prednisone taper, starting Spiriva and albuterol HFA scheduled, continuing diuresis, weaning FiO2, continuing pulmonary toilet, and incentive spirometry.

The patient also has refractory hypertension, for which the plan involves resuming home antihypertensive medications and continuing to wean nitroglycerin.

Additionally, there is suspicion of lung cancer, with plans for follow-up BAL cytology and positron emission tomography (PET) as the respiratory status improves, along with plans for tissue biopsy.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be advanced as tolerated, glycemic control will be maintained with regular insulin sliding scale, and lines will be removed when appropriate. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is ongoing. Communication regarding the patient's code status and disposition to the ICU is documented."
