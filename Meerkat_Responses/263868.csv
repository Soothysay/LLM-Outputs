   Sputum Cx with 2+ GPC in pairs on gram stain, culture pending
   UCX, BCx NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with obesity hypoventilation on home CPAP with multiple hospital
   admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure, OSA,
   panhypopituitarism, pulmonary HTN, diastolic CHF who presented with
   fatigue, and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #)Hypercarbic respiratory failure: ABGs overnight showed some
   overventilation with pCO2 in 50s. Being trialed on PSV this AM, goal to
   have pCO2 in high 60s. Patient with no complaints on admission, CXR
   without clear infiltrate, but will f/u on sputum Cx with GPCs in gram
   stain. Increased WBC difficult to separate from increase [**3-2**] to steroid
   dose in ED. If patient spikes fever, low threshold to start antibiotics
   to cover for PNA
   - wean down on vent with goal pCO2 60s, possible extubation today
   - continue to hold on sedation and allow patient to wake
   - f/u fever curve, add abx if spikes
   - continue home CPAP for OSA (16cm H2O)
   - resend sputum culture to r/o pneumonia but hold on any antibiotics
   .
   #) Facial swelling: Per daughter, patient without notable increase in
   facial swelling. Patient with no signs of anaphylaxis, acute allergic
   angiodema, no tongue swelling or urticaria. Had history of angioedema
   with ACEi, but has been on [**Last Name (un) 239**] with no medication changes recently to
   explain new facial swelling. Could also be [**3-2**] volume overload with
   morbid obesity and diastolic dysfunction. Also would want to rule out
   subclavian vein thrombosis or SVC syndrome in this patient with prior
   central line placement. Symptoms improved with steroids, benadyrl,
   pepcid in ED
   - assess for airway and tongue edema after intubation
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: patient has had episodes of hypernatremia in past,
   but is increased overnight
   - 500ml D5 bolus, recheck lytes in PM
   .
   #) LE edema/erythema: Unclear baseline. No white count of fever to
   indicate cellulitis. No history of diabetes or vascular disease, but
   likel chronic venous stasis changes. Received vanco/zosyn in ED.
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow exam, white count, fever curve off antibiotics
   .
   #) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: On CPAP at home. Did not keep last
   appointment with outpatient sleep lab. Likely component of patient's
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   - continue CPAP when extubated
   - set up patient with close follow up for sleep study and weight
   management
   .
   #)Diastolic CHF: Patient hypervolemic by CXR, JVD difficult to assess
   with body habitus, no LE edema. Patient not on lasix at home
   - allow patient to autodiurese and follow UOP and CXR
   .
   #)Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to ""empty sella"". No
   evidence of shock, hypotension.
   - continue on home dose of Prednisone 5mg, Levoxyl, and Desmopressin.
   .
   #)Hypertension:
   - hold diovan given facial edema
   - continue on home dose of metoprolol
   .
   #) Social issues: Patient was sent into ED for unclear reasons, patient
   lives at home with daughter but has had difficulty with caring for
   patient in addition to her children. Patient has had h/o noncompliance
   with appointments and meds. Upon discharge, will need to make sure case
   management helps with services at home, or possible need for SNIF
   placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old obese woman with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, sleep apnea, panhypopituitarism, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She presented with fatigue and was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been on CPAP at home and is currently receiving various medications including metoprolol, prednisone, levothyroxine, clonidine, and desmopressin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, and respiratory system compliance of 23.5 cmH2O/mL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea, along with her current presentation, suggests an underlying respiratory problem. Close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs) and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Facial swelling: The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with obesity hypoventilation on home CPAP with multiple hospital
   admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure, OSA,
   panhypopituitarism, pulmonary HTN, diastolic CHF who presented with
   facial swelling, and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #)Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
   No complaint of dyspnea on admission. However, in the ED, patient was
   found have an elevated PC02 of ~80 on an ABG. Baseline pCO2 is in the
   60's with decreased mental status so was intubated. Upon review of her
   prior ABGs, her ABG in ED not much different than prior. She has been
   hospitalized multiple times for hypercarbic respiratory failure likely
   secondary to known obesity hypoventilation (BMI greater than 50), OSA,
   and pulmonary HTN. Has evidence of overload s/p 2L fluid in ED on 2nd
   CXR. She also has elevated right-sided pressure secondary to this
   which, when they are exacerbated, may cause her to shunt right to left
   (with her prior ASD), which could then cause secondary hypoxia. The
   patient has missed her last pulmonary and sleep outpatient appointments
   and no family could be contact[**Name (NI) **] to find out patient's recent
   respiratory and functional status. No evidence of PNA on imaging, exam,
   or by labs (no leukocytosis, fever).
   - continue nebs prn
   - plan to let sedation wear off overnight and attempt extubation when
   more awake. Can give prn boluses of zyprexa, haldol, or propofol if
   agitated
   - assess for airway edema with cuff leak prior to extubation
   - continue home CPAP for OSA (16cm H2O)
   - resend sputum culture to r/o pneumonia but hold on any antibiotics
   .
   #) Facial swelling:
   Patient with no signs of anaphylaxis, acute allergic angiodema, no
   tongue swelling or urticaria. Had history of angioedema with ACEi, but
   has been on [**Last Name (un) 239**] with no medication changes recently to explain new
   facial swelling. Could also be [**3-2**] volume overload with morbid obesity
   and diastolic dysfunction. Also would want to rule out subclavian vein
   thrombosis or SVC syndrome in this patient with prior central line
   placement. Symptoms improved with steroids, benadyrl, pepcid in ED
   - assess for airway and tongue edema after intubation
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   - consider MRI venogram or CT to r/o subclavian vein thrombosis or SVC
   syndrome in AM. Per radiology upper noninvasives would not be helpful
   for this diagnosis
   .
   #) LE edema/erythema: Unclear baseline. No white count of fever to
   indicate cellulitis. No history of diabetes or vascular disease, but
   likel chronic venous stasis changes. Received vanco/zosyn in ED.
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow exam, white count, fever curve off antibiotics
   .
   #) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: On CPAP at home. Did not keep last
   appointment with outpatient sleep lab. Likely component of patient's
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   - continue CPAP when extubated
   - set up patient with close follow up for sleep study and weight
   management
   .
   #)Diastolic CHF: Patient hypervolemic by CXR, JVD difficult to assess
   with body habitus, no LE edema. Patient not on lasix at home
   - allow patient to autodiurese and follow UOP and CXR
   .
   #)Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to ""empty sella"". No
   evidence of shock, hypotension.
   - continue on home dose of Prednisone 5mg, Levoxyl, and Desmopressin.
   .
   #)Hypertension:
   - hold diovan given facial edema
   - continue on home dose of metoprolol

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), panhypopituitarism, pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with facial swelling and was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's obesity hypoventilation syndrome and OSA contribute to this condition, which can lead to decreased oxygen levels in the blood and subsequent hypoxia.
2. Facial swelling: The patient's facial swelling could be due to angioedema, volume overload, or subclavian vein thrombosis/Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome. It is important to assess for airway and tongue edema after intubation and consider imaging studies to rule out subclavian vein thrombosis or SVC syndrome.
3. Lower extremity (LE) edema/erythema: This may be caused by chronic venous stasis changes or cellulitis. It is important to follow the exam, white blood cell count, and fever curve off antibiotics to determine the cause.
4. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: The patient's CPAP use at home and missed appointment with the outpatient sleep lab suggest that this condition may contribute to her hypercarbic respiratory failure. Continuing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea/obstructive hypoventilation syndrome (OSA/OHS), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and panhypopituitarism. The patient presented to the emergency department with facial swelling and was initially treated for an allergic reaction. However, the patient developed somnolence and was intubated due to respiratory distress. Cultures were sent, and the patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected cellulitis of lower extremities. The patient also received bolus sedatives overnight and has been maintained on usual panhypopituitary replacement.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline obstructive sleep apnea/OHS and pulmonary hypertension may have contributed to the development of mild CHF in the setting of intravenous fluids in the ED. There are no clear signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. The plan is to hold antibiotics for now but will start Vancomycin for gram-positive cocci in sputum if there are any signs of worsening secretions. Follow-up sputum culture will be done. The patient is overventilated overnight given her high baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Rapid weaning of positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) is planned, aiming for extubation today. Goal pCO"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo F with obesity hypoventilation syndrome intubated for hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with fevers/leukocytosis.
   #Resp failure- concern for angioedema, though story is inconsistent.
   Has cuff leak today s/p steroids overnight.
   -extubate today
   -continue nebs
   -will need bipap at night after extubation
   #GI bleed- sm guiac + emesis overnight in setting of high dose
   steroids.
   -PPI IV BID
   -active T+S
   -if recurs would consider GI consult/EGD
   -follow Hct
   #Fever- Concerning for PNA: has GPC
s in sputum, spiked to 100.4
   through steroids.  Has Leukocytosis in setting of steroids.
   -start vanco
   -f/u micro data
   #hypernatremia- free h2o repletion today
   #HTN- off [**Last Name (un) 239**] for ? angio edemia.
   -titrate up Metoprolol for  BP control as tolerated by HR
   #) Facial swelling: Per daughter, patient without notable increase in
   facial swelling. Patient with no signs of anaphylaxis, acute allergic
   angiodema, no tongue swelling or urticaria. Had history of angioedema
   with ACEi, but has been on [**Last Name (un) 239**] with no medication changes recently to
   explain new facial swelling. Could also be [**3-2**] volume overload with
   morbid obesity and diastolic dysfunction. Also would want to rule out
   subclavian vein thrombosis or SVC syndrome in this patient with prior
   central line placement. Symptoms improved with steroids, benadyrl,
   pepcid in ED.  Had no cuff leak yesterday, but has cuff leak today s/p
   steroids
though airway edema may be [**3-2**] difficult intubation.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   #) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: On CPAP at home. Did not keep last
   appointment with outpatient sleep lab. Likely component of patient's
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   - continue CPAP when extubated
   - set up patient with close follow up for sleep study and weight
   management
   .
   #)Diastolic CHF: Patient hypervolemic by CXR, JVD difficult to assess
   with body habitus, no LE edema. Patient not on lasix at home
   - allow patient to autodiurese and follow UOP and CXR
   .
   #)Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to ""empty sella"". No
   evidence of shock, hypotension.
   - continue on home dose of Prednisone 5mg, Levoxyl, and Desmopressin.
   .
   #) Social issues: Patient was sent into ED for unclear reasons, patient
   lives at home with daughter but has had difficulty with caring for
   patient in addition to her children. Patient has had h/o noncompliance
   with appointments and meds. Upon discharge, will need to make sure case
   management helps with services at home, or possible need for SNIF
   placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome who was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis. The patient has a history of angioedema with ACE inhibitors, but no recent medication changes could explain new facial swelling. Other possible causes for facial swelling include volume overload, subclavian vein thrombosis, or superior vena cava syndrome. The patient's symptoms improved with steroids, benadyrl, and pepcid in the emergency department. She does not have a cuff leak today, but previously did not have one either. The patient had an episode of guaiac-positive emesis from the nasogastric tube, so she is being started on pantoprazole IV BID. She has been given solumedrol 20 mg IV x3 doses and now has a cuff leak this morning. The patient's blood pressure is difficult to control, and her BB has been titrated up to 25 TID. She also has hypernatremia and is being repleted with free H2O. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac involvement. She has a history of diastolic dysfunction and morbid obesity, which may contribute to her hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new onset of facial swelling. The patient's family history is significant for"

The patient has sinus bradycardia. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1920 mL, output of 1635 mL, and a balance of 285 mL. The patient is on bipap mask with standby ventilator mode. ABG results are pending. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, stable creatinine levels, and normal troponin-T levels. Other lab results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood cl"

   #GI bleed- sm guiac + emesis overnight in setting of high dose
   steroids.
   -PPI IV BID
   -active T+S
   -if recurs would consider GI consult/EGD
   -follow Hct
   #Fever- Concerning for PNA: has GPC

   #) Facial swelling: Per daughter, patient without notable increase in
   facial swelling. Patient with no signs of anaphylaxis, acute allergic
   angiodema, no tongue swelling or urticaria. Had history of angioedema
   with ACEi, but has been on [**Last Name (un) 239**] with no medication changes recently to
   explain new facial swelling. Could also be [**3-2**] volume overload with
   morbid obesity and diastolic dysfunction. Also would want to rule out
   subclavian vein thrombosis or SVC syndrome in this patient with prior
   central line placement. Symptoms improved with steroids, benadyrl,
   pepcid in ED.  Had no cuff leak yesterday, but has cuff leak today s/p
   steroids
though airway edema may be [**3-2**] difficult intubation.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   #) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: On CPAP at home. Did not keep last
   appointment with outpatient sleep lab. Likely component of patient's
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   - continue CPAP when extubated
   - set up patient with close follow up for sleep study and weight
   management
   .
   #)Diastolic CHF: Patient hypervolemic by CXR, JVD difficult to assess
   with body habitus, no LE edema. Patient not on lasix at home
   - allow patient to autodiurese and follow UOP and CXR
   .
   #)Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to ""empty sella"". No
   evidence of shock, hypotension.
   - continue on home dose of Prednisone 5mg, Levoxyl, and Desmopressin.
   .
   #) Social issues: Patient was sent into ED for unclear reasons, patient
   lives at home with daughter but has had difficulty with caring for
   patient in addition to her children. Patient has had h/o noncompliance
   with appointments and meds. Upon discharge, will need to make sure case
   management helps with services at home, or possible need for SNIF
   placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome who was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She also had fevers and leukocytosis. The patient's facial swelling was initially suspected to be angioedema, but this theory is inconsistent with the patient's reported symptoms. The patient's sinus bradycardia in the 50s without symptoms was noted. She received one dose of vancomycin for fevers and staph aureus in sputum. The patient was extubated yesterday and was on home bipap overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a concern for ongoing respiratory failure, especially since she is still on non-invasive ventilation (bipap).
2. Angioedema: Although the patient's facial swelling improved with steroids, the exact cause of angioedema remains unclear. It could be related to ACE inhibitors, volume overload, or subclavian vein thrombosis/SVC syndrome.
3. GI Bleed: The patient had guaiac positive emesis overnight, indicating a possible GI bleed, especially considering the high-dose steroids she received.
4. Fever: The patient's fever suggests the possibility of pneumonia (PNA), especially with the presence of gram-positive cocci in her sputum.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hyper"

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's recent extubation and use of non-invasive ventilation, there is a risk of respiratory distress or failure.
2. Infection: The presence of fevers and staph aureus in the sputum may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis or other complications.
3. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant output, which may indicate dehydration or ongoing fluid losses.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are within the lower range, indicating potential hypotension.
6. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is on the lower side, which could be a sign of bradycardia and potentially compromise cardiac output.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is on multiple medications, including pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, but there is still a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers.
8. Renal impairment: The patient's creatinine levels are on the higher end, suggesting possible renal dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo F with obesity hypoventilation syndrome intubated for hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with fevers/leukocytosis.
   #Resp failure- resolved. Unlikely to have had angioedema based on
   available data.
   -home meds
   -CPAP at night
   -schedueld and PRN nebs
   -lasix today, I+O goal
 1 L concern for angioedema, though story is
   inconsistent. Has cuff leak today s/p steroids overnight.
   -extubate today
   -continue nebs
   -will need bipap at night after extubation
   #GI bleed- sm guiac + emesis overnight in setting of high dose
   steroids.
   -PPI
   -active T+S
   -if recurs would consider GI consult/EGD
   -follow Hct
   #PNA- has pan sensitive staph in sputum.
   -day [**3-7**] of abx today
change to nafcillin as staph is sensitive.
   #HTN- has had poor bp control.  Feel that she did not have true
   angioedema,  has been bradycardic on higher dose of metop.
   -reduce metop to [**Hospital1 **]
   -restart home [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   #) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: On CPAP at home. Did not keep last
   appointment with outpatient sleep lab. Likely component of patient's
   hypercarbic respiratory failure
   - continue CPAP
   - set up patient with close follow up for sleep study and weight
   management
   .
   #)Diastolic CHF: Patient hypervolemic by CXR, JVD difficult to assess
   with body habitus, no LE edema. Patient not on lasix at home
   - diurese w/ lasix goal 1-2 L negative
   .
   #)Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to ""empty sella"". No
   evidence of shock, hypotension.
   - continue on home dose of Prednisone 5mg, Levoxyl, and Desmopressin.
   .
   #) Social issues: Patient was sent into ED for unclear reasons, patient
   lives at home with daughter but has had difficulty with caring for
   patient in addition to her children. Patient has had h/o noncompliance
   with appointments and meds. Upon discharge, will need to make sure case
   management helps with services at home, or possible need for SNIF
   placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and fevers/leukocytosis. She was intubated but extubated yesterday and is now on home bipap. The patient denies facial swelling prior to admission but reports tearing eyes, with an inconsistent story. She also had sinus bradycardia in the 50s without symptoms. The patient received one dose of vancomycin for fevers and staph aureus in sputum. She is currently on various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, furosemide, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 137/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for tearing eyes. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, while her blood glucose levels are within normal range. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, potential angioedema, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumonia. The plan includes extubation today, continuing nebs"

- The patient is a 53-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, who was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, but respiratory failure has resolved.
- There is a concern for angioedema, but the patient's story is inconsistent, and she has a cuff leak today after receiving steroids overnight.
- The plan is to extubate the patient today, continue nebulizers, and use BiPAP at night after extubation.
- The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed, with guaiac positive emesis overnight, in the setting of high-dose steroids.
- Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and active treatment for possible infection are recommended.
- If the gastrointestinal bleed recurs, a gastrointestinal consult or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be considered.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) should be followed.
- The patient has pneumonia caused by pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum.
- Antibiotic therapy should be continued for 3-7 days, changing to nafcillin as the staph is sensitive.
- The patient has poorly controlled hypertension and did not have true angioedema.
- Metoprolol should be reduced, and the patient should restart home medications.
- The patient has obesity hypoventilation syndrome and did not keep a scheduled appointment with the outpatient sleep"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation syndrome who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is currently on BIPAP support. The patient has a history of staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, allergies to ace inhibitors and lisinopril, and previous angioedema. She has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, nafcillin, pantoprazole, heparin, and furosemide. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/64 to 158/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for recent fevers and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, but her respiratory status seems to have improved since being intubated and placed on BIPAP support.
2. Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia: The patient has been switched from vancomycin to nafcillin due to the sensitivity of the staphylococcus aureus in her sputum. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
3. GI Bleed"
