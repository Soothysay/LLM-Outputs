   Imaging: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
   diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   21 yo F w/ pregnancy and hepatitis p/w AMS
   #  AMS: Difficult to assess as did not see pt. prior to intubation but
   she may have been withdrawing from etoh or intoxicated with another
   medication not seen on OSH drug screen. Patient did have elevated
   ammonia to 150, further supporting potential for hepatic
   encephalopathy. No focal lesions on exam and CT head negative at OSH.
   Most likely toxic/withdrawl. Also consider thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine
   - keep sedated o/n w/ fent/midaz given pancreatitis.  Discussed with OB
   who said that has no contrainidcation
   - Utox, serum tox negative
   - follow neuro exam, awaiting EEG
   - cont lactulose
   - ween sedation today and reassess
   .
   # Hepatitis: Appears to be improving, INR/bili/transaminases solidly
   trending downward, were not extremely elevated to begin with to suggest
   that pt. would develop fulminant hepatic failure.
   - Trend [**Hospital1 **] LFTs
   - ABG
   - Finger sticks QID
   - replete lytes
   - Wean from vent as soon as possible so that can follow mental status
   and feed pt.
   - Hepatitis serologies, EBV serology, and other liver labs
   - f/u hepatology recs
   .
   # Substance abuse: Severe w/ clear endangering of pregnancy
   - SW consult
   .
   # Pregnancy: per OB does not appear to be contributing to her elevated
   LFTs as would be too early for preeclampsia and she is not hypertensive
   and has several other reasons for elevated LFTs.
   - Appreciate OB recs
   - urinary protein/Cr ratio

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female who is pregnant and has a history of hepatitis. She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was found to have elevated ammonia levels, indicating potential hepatic encephalopathy. The patient also has pancreatitis, as evidenced by elevated lipase levels. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, with downward trending INR, bilirubin, and transaminases. She has been sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. The patient's substance abuse is severe and poses a risk to the pregnancy. She is currently on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and is being weaned off sedation for monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia levels and history of hepatitis suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels, indicating pancreatitis. This condition can lead to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and complications such as necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
3. Pregnancy-related complications: Given the patient's pregnancy, it is important to monitor for any complications that may arise, including preterm labor, preeclampsia, or fetal distress.
4. Substance abuse: The patient's severe substance abuse puts her at risk for further complications, including withdrawal symptoms, infections, and potential harm to"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female who is currently pregnant and has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. The patient's main complaints are liver failure and altered mental status (AMS). 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory support is currently in CPAP/PSV mode, indicating that the patient is spontaneously breathing with support.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 101 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 107/57 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.4°C.

The patient's laboratory results indicate liver function abnormalities with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), bilirubin, and INR. The patient also has deranged renal function with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The platelet count is slightly low, but the white blood cell count is within normal limits.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a gravid uterus, and the neurological examination"

   #  AMS: Mental status not improved today. Possible related to
   fentanly/midazolam accumulation in the setting of liver dysfunction.
   LFTs improving, but patient has not stooled to lactulose yet. No focal
   lesions on exam and CT head negative at OSH. Most likely
   toxic/withdrawl.
   - Change fent/midazl to propofol to see if that improves MS
   - Utox, serum tox negative
   - follow neuro exam, awaiting EEG results
   - increase lactulose titrated to bowel movement
   - ween sedation today and reassess

   # Hepatitis: Continues to improved and INR down to 1.3. Hepatology
   signed off and transplant surgery sighed off. No obvious etiology but
   may have been Tylenol toxicity.
   - d/c NAC now that INR 1.3
   - Wean from vent as soon as possible so that can follow mental status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a pregnant woman with liver failure, currently in the ICU. She is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has shown an opacity on chest X-ray. Antibiotics have been started, and an EEG has been obtained. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 107/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving sedation and analgesia. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,266 mL and output of 3,855 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,589 mL. The patient's blood gases indicate a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal coagulation profile (PTT/INR), and elevated lipase levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), or barotrauma.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The liver failure could progress to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and decreased levels of consciousness.

   21 yo F w/ pregnancy and hepatitis p/w AMS
   #  AMS: Difficult to assess as did not see pt. prior to intubation but
   she may have been withdrawing from etoh or intoxicated with another
   medication not seen on OSH drug screen. Patient did have elevated
   ammonia to 150, further supporting potential for hepatic
   encephalopathy. No focal lesions on exam and CT head negative at OSH.
   Most likely toxic/withdrawl. Also consider thiamine deficiency.
   - Thiamine
   - keep sedated o/n w/ fent/midaz given pancreatitis.  Discussed with OB
   who said that has no contrainidcation
   - Utox, serum tox negative
   - follow neuro exam, awaiting EEG
   - cont lactulose
   - ween sedation today and reassess
   .
   # Hepatitis: Appears to be improving, INR/bili/transaminases solidly
   trending downward, were not extremely elevated to begin with to suggest
   that pt. would develop fulminant hepatic failure.
   - Trend [**Hospital1 **] LFTs
   - ABG
   - Finger sticks QID
   - replete lytes
   - Wean from vent as soon as possible so that can follow mental status
   and feed pt.
   - Hepatitis serologies, EBV serology, and other liver labs
   - f/u hepatology recs

   # Substance abuse: Severe w/ clear endangering of pregnancy
   - SW consult

   # Pregnancy: per OB does not appear to be contributing to her elevated
   LFTs as would be too early for preeclampsia and she is not hypertensive
   and has several other reasons for elevated LFTs.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female who is pregnant and has been admitted to the ICU with liver failure. She was brought in with altered mental status (AMS) and is suspected to have alcohol abuse. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and potential hepatic encephalopathy. Other assessments and plans include hepatitis, substance abuse, and pregnancy.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition occurs due to severe liver dysfunction and can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and even coma.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently supported by mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Worsening liver failure: The patient's liver function is already compromised, and if not managed properly, it may continue to deteriorate, leading to multiorgan failure.

4. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing infections such as bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, or pneumonia.

5. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with an elevated INR, indicating a higher risk of bleeding complications.

6. Thiamine deficiency: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and malnutrition, there is a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   21yoF transferred with liver failure (now INR, LFTs, bilirubin trending
   down), likely multifactorial in nature with tylenol, ETOH; obstretic
   complications also considered such as eclampsia, HELLP syndrome.
   1.       Hepatic Failure:  markers improving; multifactorial etiologies
   as above.  Normal liver US with dopplers.  Per OB, unlikely related to
   preeclampsia
   - increase lactulose to QID
   - f/up viral hepatitis studies
   2.       Neuro:  Altered mental status etiologies: hepatic
   encephalopathy, ETOH withdrawal, mind-altering substances
   EEG done, read pending.  [**Doctor First Name 92**]/lipase trending down.
   - continue lactulose
   - change to propofol, d/c versed, wean fentanyl
   - consider MRI brain if not improving today
   3.       Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of confusion, acute
   hypoxemia possibly in setting of sedation.  Now with copious
   secretions, CXR with ?PNA, started abx for VAP yesterday.
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - f/up sputum culture
   - has not tolerated attempts to wean sedation, developing significant
   agitation. Possible that ETT aggravating agitation and sedation needs,
   compounded by poor hepatic clearance. Would favor moving toward
   4.       OB:  Early for pre-eclampsia (gestational age 22weeks)
   - monitor BP, mental status
   - f/up OB recs
   5.       ETOH: Picture will be complicated by ETOH withdrawal
   - currently on thiamine, MVI
   - d/c versed, ativan boluses prn w/d
   - social work consult
   - will need psych consult once extubated

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old pregnant woman who was transferred to the ICU with liver failure. She is intubated due to poor mental status and has been diagnosed with acute hepatitis. The patient's INR and transaminases are trending down. She has increasing secretions, and there is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has a cuff leak, indicating potential extubation, and her tachycardia has improved after receiving a 500 cc bolus. The patient's history is limited due to sedation, but there are no known drug allergies. She is on multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has markers of hepatic failure, but they are improving. Multifactorial etiologies such as tylenol, ETOH, obstetric complications, and preeclampsia are being considered.
2. Neurological Issues: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, ETOH withdrawal, or mind-altering substances. An EEG has been done, and the results are pending. Propofol may be considered as a sedative instead of versed, and an MRI brain may be considered if there is no improvement.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has acute hypoxemia. She has copious secretions and a chest"

   The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the
   stomach.
   There is no change in the left retrocardiac consolidation with air
   bronchogram
   that might be consistent with infectious process. There is slight
   interval
   improvement of pulmonary edema which is currently mild to moderate.
   Bilateral
   pleural effusions are present.
   Assessment and Plan
   21yoF transferred with liver failure (now INR, LFTs, bilirubin trending
   down), likely multifactorial in nature with tylenol, ETOH; obstretic
   complications also considered such as eclampsia, HELLP syndrome.
   1.       Hepatic Failure:  markers improving; multifactorial etiologies
   as above.  Normal liver US with dopplers.  Per OB, unlikely related to
   preeclampsia
   - increase lactulose to QID
   - f/up viral hepatitis studies
   2.       Neuro:  Altered mental status etiologies: hepatic
   encephalopathy, ETOH withdrawal, mind-altering substances
   EEG done, read pending.  [**Doctor First Name 92**]/lipase trending down.
   - continue lactulose
   - change to propofol, d/c versed, wean fentanyl
   - consider MRI brain if not improving today
   3.       Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of confusion, acute
   hypoxemia possibly in setting of sedation.  Now with copious
   secretions, CXR with ?PNA, started abx for VAP yesterday.
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - f/up sputum culture
   - wean sedation with hopes to extubate soon
   4.       OB:  Early for pre-eclampsia (gestational age 22weeks)
   - monitor BP, mental status
   - f/up OB recs
   5.       ETOH: Picture will be complicated by ETOH withdrawal
   - currently on thiamine, MVI
   - d/c versed, ativan boluses prn w/d
   - social work consult
   - will need psych consult once extubated

","The patient is a 21-year-old female who is 22 weeks pregnant and has been transferred with liver failure. She was intubated for poor mental status and now presents with an increasing cough, chest X-ray suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a cuff leak. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2. She has a history of acute hepatitis and respiratory failure. 

The patient's medical history is significant for possible tylenol and ethanol use, obstetric complications such as eclampsia and HELLP syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol withdrawal, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for suspected VAP, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and supportive care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further hepatic dysfunction, neurological decline due to hepatic encephalopathy or alcohol withdrawal, and obstetric complications such as preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
   21yoF transferred with liver failure (now INR, LFTs, bilirubin trending
   down), likely multifactorial in nature with tylenol, ETOH; obstretic
   complications also considered such as eclampsia, HELLP syndrome.
   1.       Hepatic Failure:  markers improving; multifactorial etiologies
   -  RUQ ultrasound with dopplers to assess hepatic vein thrombosis
   -  Follow LFTs daily, repeat INR
   - glucose qid given overall improvement
   - Liver service to consult
   - Viral hepatitis panel pending
   2.       Neuro:  Altered mental status etiologies: hepatic
   encephalopathy, ETOH withdrawal, mind-altering substances
   - EEG to assess for seizure-activity, obtain off versed
   - Urine/serum tox
   - continue lactulose
   - Ideally would use propofol, though cannot because of her elevated
   lipase
   3.       Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of confusion, acute
   hypoxemia possibly in setting of sedation
   - unclear etiology for her hypoxemia acutely; CXR without significant
   infiltrate
   - Needs improvement in her mental status to be safely extubated
   4.       OB:  Early for pre-eclampsia (gestational age 22weeks)
   - check serum uric acid
   - monitor BP, mental status
   - f/u peripheral smear
   - Appreciate OB involvement
   5.       ETOH: Picture will be complicated by ETOH withdrawal
   - currently on versed, thiamine, MVI
   - Will need to transition to intermittent dosing once extubated
   - social work consult
   - will need psych consult once extubated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old pregnant female who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and acute hepatitis. She is currently intubated and sedated due to poor mental status. The patient's medical history includes liver failure, likely caused by a combination of factors such as Tylenol and alcohol use, as well as obstetric complications like eclampsia or HELLP syndrome.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and INR are improving, indicating some improvement in liver function. However, further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause of the hepatic failure. This may involve conducting a RUQ ultrasound with dopplers to assess for hepatic vein thrombosis, following LFTs and INR levels daily, repeating glucose levels every four hours, and consulting with a liver service. A viral hepatitis panel is also pending.

2. Neurological Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes, including hepatic encephalopathy, ETOH withdrawal, or the use of mind-altering substances. To assess seizure activity, an EEG will be performed, and urine/serum toxicology screening will be conducted. Lactulose will continue to be administered, and ideally, propofol would be used for sedation; however, this is not possible due to the patient's elevated lipase"

","The patient is a 21-year-old female who is 22 weeks pregnant and has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and acute hepatitis. She was intubated for poor mental status and now has improving INR and transaminases. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. She is receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions.

Her blood cultures show an increased white blood cell count and presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting a bacterial infection. The respiratory culture is pending. The chest X-ray reveals bilateral pleural effusions and mild to moderate pulmonary edema, but no significant infiltrates.

The patient's history includes liver failure, likely caused by a combination of factors such as tylenol, EtOH, obstetric complications, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome. The liver enzymes, bilirubin, and INR are improving. An ultrasound with dopplers is recommended to assess hepatic vein thrombosis.

Her neurologic status is altered, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, EtOH withdrawal, or mind-altering substances. An EEG has been ordered, and urine/serum tox screens will be performed. Lactulose will continue to be administered.

The patient's respiratory failure may be due to an unclear etiology, possibly related to sedation. Improvement in her mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation. She was found down with transaminitis and subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent extubation, which was complicated by aspiration of vomitus and stridor, but responded to racemic epinephrine and solu-medrol. She is currently on invasive ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 117/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurological status has improved post-extubation. She has a history of alcohol abuse, and her liver function tests are abnormal. She denies alcohol and Tylenol use. The patient's sputum culture is pending, and she has been started on Vancomycin and cefepime. She also has leukocytosis and is awaiting further test results. The patient's mental status is alert and oriented, but easily directable. She has hyperreflexic knee reflexes. Her abdomen is gravid and soft, with bowel sounds present. She has bilateral wheezing in her lungs and no edema. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. She is negative for hepatitis B and C, and her smooth muscle antibody is negative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old female who is 22 weeks pregnant and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She was found down and had transaminitis. The patient underwent extubation but experienced complications such as aspiration with vomitus and stridor, which responded to racemic epi/solumedrol and ativan. She has been on invasive ventilation, and her mental status improved post-extubation. The patient's liver function abnormalities are improving, but she has leukocytosis and a possible early pneumonia based on chest X-ray findings. She is afebrile and appears notoxic. The patient denies alcohol and tylenol use, and her hepatitis serologies are unremarkable. She has a history of severe substance abuse, which poses a risk to the pregnancy. The fetus appears normal on ultrasound. The patient requires further evaluation and counseling for substance abuse and pregnancy management. She is currently on various medications and has several lines including a PIV and A-line. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be kept in the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which required invasive ventilation. There is a possibility of recurrence or worsening of respiratory symptoms, especially with the presence of pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The chest X-ray suggests early pneumonia, and the patient's leukocytosis indicates an infection. Monitoring for signs of"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 21-year-old female who is pregnant and has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She presented with altered mental status, likely due to sedation from fentanyl and midazolam, which may have accumulated in her system due to liver dysfunction. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but she has not yet had a bowel movement despite receiving lactulose. There are no focal lesions on examination and a CT scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities, suggesting that her mental status may be related to toxic or withdrawal effects. 

The patient's hepatitis is showing signs of improvement, with a decreasing INR. Hepatology has signed off and transplant surgery has also given the go-ahead. There is no obvious etiology for her hepatitis, but it may have been caused by Tylenol toxicity. 

The patient has a history of severe substance abuse, which poses a significant risk to her pregnancy. A social work consult has been requested. 

The patient's pregnancy does not appear to be contributing to her elevated LFTs. Obstetric recommendations will be appreciated, and a discussion regarding termination will take place post-extubation. 

The patient's medical plan includes continuing IV fluids, repleting electrolytes as needed, and providing a regular diet. Prophylactic medications, such as famotidine and probiotics, as well as a bowel regimen have been initiated. The patient has two lines in place, including a peripheral IV line"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old pregnant woman who was transferred with liver failure, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and international normalized ratio (INR) are trending down, indicating improvement. The patient has been extubated and is now on CPAP/PSV mode with 50% FiO2, maintaining a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/89 to 107/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and temperature within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose level is 126 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level is 28.2%, platelet count is 250 mg/dL, and creatinine level is 0.3 mg/dL.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft, gravid abdomen. The chest X-ray shows possible pneumonia. The patient's lab results indicate hepatitis B surface antibody positivity but negative core antibody. The sputum culture shows >25 PMNs, <10 epithelial cells/100X field, and 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

   Assessment and Plan
   21yoF transferred with liver failure (now INR, LFTs, bilirubin trending
   down), likely multifactorial in nature with tylenol, ETOH; obstretic
   complications also considered such as eclampsia, HELLP syndrome.
   1.       Hepatic Failure:  markers improving; multifactorial etiologies
   as above.  Normal liver US with dopplers.  Per OB, unlikely related to
   preeclampsia
   - increase lactulose to QID
   - f/up viral hepatitis studies
   2.       Neuro:  Altered mental status etiologies: hepatic
   encephalopathy, ETOH withdrawal, mind-altering substances
   EEG done, read pending.  [**Doctor First Name 92**]/lipase trending down.
   - continue lactulose
   - change to propofol, d/c versed, wean fentanyl
   - consider MRI brain if not improving today
   3.       Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of confusion, acute
   hypoxemia possibly in setting of sedation.  Now with copious
   secretions, CXR with ?PNA, started abx for VAP yesterday.
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - f/up sputum culture
   - has not tolerated attempts to wean sedation, developing significant
   agitation. Possible that ETT aggravating agitation and sedation needs,
   compounded by poor hepatic clearance. Would favor moving toward
   4.       OB:  Early for pre-eclampsia (gestational age 22weeks)
   - monitor BP, mental status
   - f/up OB recs
   5.       ETOH: Picture will be complicated by ETOH withdrawal
   - currently on thiamine, MVI
   - d/c versed, ativan boluses prn w/d
   - social work consult
   - will need psych consult once extubated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female who is 22 weeks pregnant and has been admitted with liver failure and respiratory failure. The patient's INR and transaminases are trending down, indicating improvement in liver function. The patient was intubated due to poor mental status and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of possible Tylenol and EtOH use, obstetric complications such as eclampsia and HELLP syndrome are also considered. The liver ultrasound with dopplers showed no abnormalities, and the obstetrician believes that the liver failure is unlikely related to preeclampsia.

The patient's altered mental status may be caused by hepatic encephalopathy, EtOH withdrawal, or mind-altering substances. An EEG has been done, but the results are pending. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to confusion, acute hypoxemia possibly in the setting of sedation. A chest X-ray suggests possible pneumonia, and antibiotics have been started for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient is also being monitored for obstetric complications such as pre-eclampsia, and there are concerns about EtOH withdrawal. The patient's glycemic control, nutrition, and medication lines are being managed in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening liver failure: The patient's liver function markers are improving, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Neurological complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   21yoF transferred with liver failure (now INR, LFTs, bilirubin trending
   down), likely multifactorial in nature with tylenol, ETOH, extubated
   yesterday.
   1.       Hepatic Failure:  markers improving; multifactorial etiologies
   as above.  Normal liver US with dopplers.  Per OB, unlikely related to
   preeclampsia.  All viral hep studies neg except HBV surface Ab, Ag
   negative. LFTs continuing to trend down.
   - back off on lactulose as just starting POs today
   2.       Neuro:  Altered mental status etiologies: hepatic
   encephalopathy, ETOH withdrawal, mind-altering substances
   EEG done, read pending.  MS markedly improved today  compared w
   yesterday.
   - hold on MRI given MS improvement
   3.       Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of confusion, acute
   hypoxemia possibly in setting of sedation.  Now with copious
   secretions, CXR with ?PNA, started abx for VAP 2 days ago.  WBCs up, no
   fever, ?[**1-7**] steroids.  Vomited peri-extubation yesterday, likely
   aspiration.
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - f/up sputum culture
   4.       OB:  Early for pre-eclampsia (gestational age 22weeks)
   - monitor BP, mental status
   - f/up OB recs
   5.       ETOH: Picture c/w  ETOH withdrawal
   - currently on thiamine, MVI; can transition to prenatal vitamins once
   tolerating POs
   - continue ativan boluses prn w/d
   - social work consult

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 21-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation with liver failure and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred with a likely multifactorial etiology, including Tylenol and EtOH use. She was intubated due to poor mental status but has now been extubated. Her INR and transaminases are trending down.

The patient's 24-hour events include being extubated yesterday with increased work of breathing (WOB) and intermittent stridor post-extubation, which improved with racemic epi nebs and solumedrol. The patient also received N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which was discontinued, and started on lorazepam (Ativan) for withdrawal symptoms. She was diuresed prior to extubation.

The patient has no known drug allergies. Her last doses of antibiotics were cefepime and vancomycin on [**2137-11-29**] at 10:00 PM and [**2137-11-30**] at 08:07 AM, respectively. She is currently receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, furosemide, lorazepam, and heparin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvement in mental status. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 142/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. She has a sinus tachycardia rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.8-12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 222 K/uL, blood glucose of 100-126 mg/dL, and various liver function tests. Her hepatitis studies are negative except for the presence of hepatitis B surface antibody (antigen negative).

The patient's imaging shows a chest X-ray with possible pneumonia, and her sputum culture indicates the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, as well as budding yeast.

The assessment and plan include several components:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests are improving, and further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Neurological: The patient has altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, EtOH withdrawal, and possible mind-altering substances. An EEG is pending, and an MRI has been held off due to improvement in mental status.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to acute hypoxemia and confusion. She now has copious secretions, and her chest X-ray suggests possible pneumonia. She is receiving antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted with liver failure, likely caused by a combination of factors including Tylenol and alcohol use. She was intubated due to poor mental status but is now extubated. Her INR and transaminases are trending down, indicating improvement. She has been started on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and ativan for withdrawal symptoms. The patient also has respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia, for which she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She is being closely monitored for pre-eclampsia, given her early gestational age of 22 weeks. The patient's care plan includes nutrition support through trial of oral intake, glycemic control, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and communication with the patient and her family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: While the patient's liver function tests are improving, she may still face complications related to liver dysfunction such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. She may require further respiratory support or additional interventions to address this issue.
3. Pre-eclampsia: Given the patient's early gestational age, there is a risk of developing pre-eclampsia, which can lead to complications for both the mother and the fetus.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female admitted to the ICU with confusion and a history of overdose. She was weaned off mechanical ventilation and is currently on room air. The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 92 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 104/60 mmHg to 148/99 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

The patient has a history of growing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus in her sputum. She has been started on clear liquids with good intake. There is no known drug allergy. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an inflammatory response. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. Renal function tests reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Liver enzymes are slightly elevated, while electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

Radiology images are available but not described in detail. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. Prophylactic measures including antico"

The patient is a 21-year-old female who is currently 22 weeks pregnant. She was found down with transaminitis and has since undergone extubation with an improving mental status. The patient's sputum is growing Gram-positive cocci (GPCs), indicating a possible pneumonia. She also has leukocytosis and aspirated perixtubation. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have been improving, and she denies using Tylenol and alcohol. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been discontinued. Hepatitis serologies, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and smooth muscle antibodies are unremarkable. The patient is suspected of substance abuse, which poses a severe risk to the pregnancy. Social work and psychiatry consultations have been requested. The fetus appears normal on ultrasound, and prenatal vitamins have been started. The obstetrician will need to return to discuss termination. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and she is advancing to a regular diet. Her glycemic control is being managed, and she has multiple IV lines in place for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old female who is 22 weeks pregnant and was found down with transaminitis. She has since been extubated and her mental status is improving. She is afebrile and appears not to be toxic. A chest X-ray shows findings consistent with early pneumonia. The patient's sputum is growing coag-positive staph, and sensitivities are pending. She will continue on vancomycin and cefepime, with the coverage to be narrowed following finalization of sputum cultures.

The patient is also experiencing acute medication-induced mental status changes (AMS), which have significantly improved post-extubation. This is likely related to medication toxicity. The neuro exam will be followed, and EEG results are awaited.

There are also ongoing concerns regarding the patient's hepatitis, pancreatitis, substance abuse, pregnancy, and fetal well-being. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, and she has acknowledged Tylenol and alcohol use. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been discontinued. Hepatitis serologies, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and smooth muscle antibodies are unremarkable. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is pending.

Lipase levels are elevated, initially suspected to be secondary to propofol administration, but now rising again despite the patient denying abdominal pain. No clear explanation has been identified"
