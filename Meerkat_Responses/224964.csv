   41 yo M with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS ([**2147-10-31**]) and s/p prolonged
   hospitalization (ending [**2147-11-16**]) for PCP pneumonia, presents to
   hospital today with dyspnea. was found to be hypoxic in ED and was
   susequently intubated.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely an infectious cause of hypoxemic respiratory failure given
   fever, elevated WBC count from baseline, and patchy opacities on CXR.
   Given recent hospitalization and treatment for PCP pneumonia, is
   reasonable to continue treatment with Bactrim. Additionally, with large
   A-a gradient, should administer steroids in setting of suspected
   progressive PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 931**]. Community-acquired pneumonia is a
   possibility as is a hospital-acquired pneumonia. Given high fever,
   influenza will be considered and patient sould be ruled-out. Unlikely
   to be an MI given lack of history, EKG changes, or cardiac enzyme
   elevation at presentation. No need to continue to trend cardiac
   enzymes.
   - Continue AC ventilation
   - Attempt to liberate from FiO2 of 100%
   - Obtain suctoin sputum sample and consider need for BAL for better
   airway sampling
   - Empirically treat community acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin
   - Empirically treat hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and
   cefepime
   - Treat known PCP pneumonia with Bactrim IV and steroids
   - Obtain nasopharyngeal swab and empirically treat influenza with
   oseltamivir
   - ID consult given complicated respiratory failure and AIDS status
   #. Hypotension:
   Patient not hypotensive at presentation, though developed a minimal
   vasopressor requirement prior to being transferred out of the ED. No
   known cardiac history. Possible component of hypovolemic shock, though
   must likely to be septic shock in setting of fever, CXR appearance,
   hypoxic respiratory failure. Received 9 L of IVF in the ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine titrated to MAPs greater than 65
   - Continue boluses targeted at liberation from norepinephrine
   - Place A-line for closer monitoring
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   #. Fevers:
   Given appearance of CXR and concurrent hypoxia, no reason to think that
   there is alternate cause of fevers at this time; however, should likely
   obtain urine sample to rule out UTI.
   - Urinalysis with culture
   #. HIV/AIDS:
   Last measured CD4 was 26 on [**2147-11-4**] at time of diagnosis.
   - Continue Emtricitabine-Tenofovir, Ritonavir
   - Hold darunavir as it cannot be crushed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS and a history of prolonged hospitalization for PCP pneumonia. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea, was found to be hypoxic in the emergency department, and subsequently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This is likely due to an infectious cause, given the fever, elevated white blood cell count, and patchy opacities on chest X-ray. Possible causes include community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and progression of PCP pneumonia. Treatment includes continuing AC ventilation, attempting to wean off FiO2 of 100%, obtaining sputum samples, considering bronchoalveolar lavage for better airway sampling, empirically treating community-acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin, hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime, known PCP pneumonia with Bactrim IV and steroids, and treating influenza with oseltamivir.

2. Hypotension: The patient was not initially hypotensive but developed minimal vasopressor requirements prior to being transferred out of the emergency department. Possible causes include hypovolemic shock and septic shock. Treatment includes continuing norepinephrine titrated to mean arterial pressures greater than"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS and recent hospitalization for Pneumocystis Jiroveci pneumonia. He presented to the hospital with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and is suspected to have an infectious cause for his hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has been treated with Bactrim for PCP pneumonia, as well as antibiotics for community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further hypoxia and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection may progress to sepsis, causing systemic inflammation and organ failure.
3. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base balance may continue to be disrupted due to IV fluids, potentially leading to further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient may experience low blood pressure due to septic shock, which can compromise organ perfusion.
5. Fevers: The patient's fever may indicate an ongoing infection that needs to be identified and treated promptly.
6. HIV/AIDS: The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of opportunistic infections and complications related to HIV/AIDS management.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with recently diagnosed AIDS (CD4 count of 26) and PCP (Pneumocystis Jiroveci pneumonia). He has been hospitalized before and returned with respiratory distress. The patient was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on vasopressors.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and shock. He is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), PCP, and multifocal pneumonia with antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, tamiflu, and bactrim. He is also receiving steroids (solumedrol) and continues to require levophed for blood pressure support.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/52 mmHg to 189/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and he has received a total of 8,802 mL of fluids since midnight.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 300, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 120 mEq/L. His white blood cell (WBC) count is 2.7 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) is 21.0%, platelet count (Plt) is 257 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) is 0.7 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels are elevated at 126 mg/dL, 238 mg/dL, and 285 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging shows multifocal patchy opacities predominantly in the mid lung fields, which have increased over the interval with large volume fluid resuscitation.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, ARDS, pneumonia, and shock. The treating physician is considering a possible immune response to PCP. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case may include worsening respiratory failure, organ dysfunction due to sepsis, further spread of infection, complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, and potential hematologic or metabolic abnormalities."

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS and a history of prolonged hospitalization for PCP pneumonia. He presented with dyspnea, was found to be hypoxic in the ED, and subsequently intubated. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing worsening of his PCP pneumonia, although hospital-acquired pneumonia and influenza are also possible considerations. The plan includes performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning with the intention of extubation today. Further analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results is pending, and the patient will continue on empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin and for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime until BAL culture results are negative for 48 hours. Treatment for known PCP pneumonia with Bactrim IV and steroids will be continued, with adjustments to the steroid dose as appropriate. The patient will also be empirically treated for influenza with oseltamivir, and follow-up for CMV viral load and crypto antigen, as well as urine legionella, is planned. Trending LDH levels will also be appreciated.

2. Hypotension: The patient did not present with hypotension initially but developed a minimal vasopressor requirement prior to being transferred out of the ED. Possible causes include hypovolemic shock or septic shock. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS and a history of prolonged hospitalization for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). He presented with dyspnea and was found to be hypoxic in the emergency department. The patient was subsequently intubated and admitted to the ICU.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely due to worsening of his PCP pneumonia or possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia. Influenza is also considered as a potential cause. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to obtain samples for analysis. The BAL results showed no microorganisms, but further testing is pending.

The patient has been treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin, hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime, and known PCP pneumonia with Bactrim IV and steroids. The steroid dosing needs adjustment. The patient is being monitored for CMV viral load and antigen, as well as urine Legionella antigen. Repeat nasopharyngeal swab and empirical treatment for influenza with oseltamivir are also planned.

The patient developed hypotension, which could be related to hypovolemic shock or septic shock. He received 9 liters of intravenous fluids in the ED and his blood pressures have been stable. The patient will continue to receive fluid boluses as needed and follow-up blood"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with recently diagnosed HIV/AIDS and PCP. He has been treated for HAP and PCP and is currently on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, tamiflu, and bactrim. The patient also receives solumedrol for immunosuppression. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday afternoon, and an ID consult agreed with the antibiotic choices and stopping HAART while he is here. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/51 mmHg to 115/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode. His temperature is slightly elevated at 36.9°C.

The patient has received various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for pain, which he does not have. The patient appears well-nourished and is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Neurologic assessment shows purposeful movement and appropriate conversation.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 1.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7"

   41 yo M with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS ([**2147-10-31**]) and s/p prolonged
   hospitalization (ending [**2147-11-16**]) for PCP pneumonia, who presented
   with dyspnea.  Was found to be hypoxic in ED and was subsequently
   intubated and successfully extubated.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Felt to most likely be worsening of
   his PCP pneumonia, especially considering positive BAL results.  Could
   also consider influenza but this was negative.
   - FU final BAL results
   - Treat known PCP pneumonia with Bactrim IV and steroids (will readjust
   steroid dose to 40mg po bid x 5 days total (will change dose on [**11-27**]),
   then 40mg po daily x 5 days, then 20mg daily x 11 days).
   - Have stopped other antibiotics and Tamiflu
   - FU CMV VL and [**Month/Day (4) **] antigen, urine legionella
   - can trend LDH
   - appreciate ID recs
   #. Hypotension:  Patient not hypotensive at presentation, though
   developed a minimal vasopressor requirement prior to being transferred
   out of the ED. No known cardiac history. Possible component of
   hypovolemic shock, though must likely to be septic shock in setting of
   fever, CXR appearance, hypoxic respiratory failure. Received 9 L of IVF
   in the ED and blood pressures have been stable but low.
   - Goal MAP 60 but will hold off on fluids at this time as clinically he
   is doing well
   - Can check CVP to assess volume
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   #. HIV/AIDS: Last measured CD4 was 26 on [**2147-11-4**] at time of
   diagnosis.
   - Will likely restart HAART today, but will confirm with ID
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Could consider IRS as possible contributor to current presentation
   - started azithromycin 1200mg po qweek as MAC prophylaxis given CD4<50
   # Anemia: Hct now stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS and a previous hospitalization for PCP pneumonia. He presented with dyspnea, was intubated, and successfully extubated. The patient's current health issues include hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to worsening PCP pneumonia, and hypotension, possibly related to septic shock.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening PCP pneumonia is the most likely cause of his hypoxemic respiratory failure. Other possible causes include influenza, but this has been ruled out by negative DFA results.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to septic shock, especially considering the fever, CXR appearance, and hypoxic respiratory failure. It is also possible that the patient is experiencing hypovolemic shock.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but his Hct levels are now stable.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient should be treated for known PCP pneumonia with Bactrim IV and steroids. The steroid dose will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have been stable but low. The goal MAP is 60, and fluids should be administered cautiously. Blood cultures should be followed up.
3. HIV/AIDS: The patient's CD4 count is low at 26. HAART should be restarted, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo M with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS ([**2147-10-31**]) and s/p prolonged
   hospitalization (ending [**2147-11-16**]) for PCP pneumonia, who presented
   with dyspnea. was found to be hypoxic in ED and was subsequently
   intubated and successfully extubated.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Felt to most likely be worsening of
   his PCP pneumonia, especially considering positive BAL results.  Could
   also consider influenza but this was negative.
   - FU final BAL results
   - Continue empiric tx of community acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin
   and empiric tx of hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and
   cefepime until BAL culture results  negative x 48 hours
 will happen
   today at 2pm
   - Treat known PCP pneumonia with Bactrim IV and steroids (will readjust
   steroid dose to 40mg po bid x 5 days total (will change dose on [**11-27**]),
   then 40mg po daily x 5 days, then 20mg daily x 11 days).
   - have stopped Tamiflu
   - FU CMV VL and [**Month/Day (4) **] antigen, urine legionella
   - can trend LDH
   - appreciate ID recs
- started azithromycin 1200mg po qweek as MAC prophylaxis given CD4<50
   #. Hypotension:  Patient not hypotensive at presentation, though
   developed a minimal vasopressor requirement prior to being transferred
   out of the ED. No known cardiac history. Possible component of
   hypovolemic shock, though must likely to be septic shock in setting of
   fever, CXR appearance, hypoxic respiratory failure. Received 9 L of IVF
   in the ED and blood pressures have been stable.
   - Goal MAP 60 but will hold off on fluids at this time as going to
   extubate
   - Check CVP to assess volume
   - Continue fluid boluses as needed
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   #. HIV/AIDS: Last measured CD4 was 26 on [**2147-11-4**] at time of
   diagnosis.
   - Will hold off on HAART at this time per ID
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Could consider IRS as possible contributor to current presentation
   #  Non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely due to IVF in ED, bicarb
   improving today but still low
   - Continue to monitor daily
   # Anemia: Dropped Hct in last 24 hours.
   - Consider blood transfusion if feel that he needs volume resuscitation
   - Maintain active type and screen

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS who presented with dyspnea and was found to be hypoxic in the emergency department. He was subsequently intubated and successfully extubated. The patient has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and is suspected of having worsening respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia or possibly influenza, although this has been ruled out.

The patient's current medications include prednisone for PCP pneumonia, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime for community-acquired pneumonia, Bactrim IV for PCP pneumonia, and azithromycin for MAC prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/47 to 102/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 5L of oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, glucose of 149 mg/dL, and a slightly elevated lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are pending, as well as tests for CMV, cryptococcal antigen,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS and a history of prolonged hospitalization for PCP pneumonia. The patient presented with dyspnea and was found to be hypoxic in the emergency department, requiring intubation and subsequent extubation.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely due to worsening PCP pneumonia. Other potential causes such as influenza have been ruled out. The patient is being treated with Bactrim IV and steroids for the PCP pneumonia. 

Additionally, the patient has experienced hypotension, which may be attributed to septic shock in the setting of fever, CXR appearance, and hypoxic respiratory failure. Fluid resuscitation has been administered, and the goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is set at 60. 

The patient also has HIV/AIDS with a last measured CD4 count of 26. HAART therapy has been restarted, and azithromycin prophylaxis for MAC has been initiated given the low CD4 count.

There is a slight trend of transaminitis, possibly related to restarting HAART. Anemia is present but stable, and the patient's glycemic control is being maintained with insulin.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving a regular diet, insulin for glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures including DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS and a history of prolonged hospitalization for PCP pneumonia. He presented with dyspnea, was found to be hypoxic in the ED, intubated, and successfully extubated. The patient's current condition shows hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to worsening PCP pneumonia. He is being treated with Bactrim IV and steroids, and other antibiotics have been stopped. CMV viral load is pending, and the patient's LDH levels are trending. The patient also has hypotension, which may be related to septic shock, but no treatment is currently necessary as the patient is asymptomatic. His HIV/AIDS status is being managed with HAART and azithromycin prophylaxis. The patient has slightly elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to restarting HAART. His anemia is stable, and he is maintaining regular diet and insulin for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, and is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor later today.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening PCP pneumonia: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is likely due to worsening PCP pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient"

   prednisone as we are doing, ""note that unclear if PCP DFA is definitely
   a way to explain his ""new"" decompensation vs old organisms from prior
   episode; clinically PCP fits grew data, continue azithro ppx, restarted
   HAART (those this was not the initial plan)
   - hypotensive to SBPs 70s, was asymptomatic and resolved on own
   - sent work excuse letter to his job
   - did not d/c CVL yet given episodes of hypotension
