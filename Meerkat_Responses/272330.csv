   Assessment and Plan: 58 year old female with a history of metastatic
   renal caricnoma to the brain, spine and lungs who was admitted for
   planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9 who
   postoperatively has developed fevers, tachycardia and imaging
   suggestive of pneumonia.
   Hospital Acquired Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress:  Patient transferred
   to the ICU for acute respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea
   and fevers.  Chest CT from earlier in the day with evidence of
   bibasilar dependent consolidations.  Her initial acute distress
   resolved with supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments but
   subsequently has worsened.  Overnight she was increased to 70% facemask
   with saturations in the high 90s but with subjective dsypnea and
   tachypnea.  Other potential etiologies on the differential include
   pulmonary embolism although less likley with frank infiltrates on CT as
   well as lymphangitic spread of tumor.  At baseline patient has poor
   pulmonary reserve s/p mulitple lung resections with mild restrictive
   defect on recent PFTs. .

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma to the brain, spine, and lungs. She was admitted for a planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9. Postoperatively, she developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea, and fevers. The chest CT showed bibasilar dependent consolidations, indicating hospital-acquired pneumonia. She initially improved with supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments but subsequently worsened. She is now on 70% facemask oxygen with saturations in the high 90s but still experiencing subjective dyspnea and tachypnea.

Potential complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening condition despite supplemental oxygen may indicate the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her vital signs, particularly oxygen saturation levels, is essential.

2. Pneumonia progression: Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be severe and may progress rapidly. Continuous assessment of her pulmonary status through physical examination, chest X-rays, and laboratory tests is crucial to monitor for any deterioration.

3. Infection spread: As the patient has metastatic renal carcinoma, there is a concern for the spread of infection. Blood cultures have been obtained, and it is important to monitor for signs of sepsis or systemic infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with respiratory distress and was admitted to the MICU. They were started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient appeared extremely uncomfortable, so they received ativan and dilaudid for pain and anxiety. They also received 10 mg IV lasix for potential volume overload, but it did not improve their respiratory status. The BNP was negative at 436.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, hives; morphine, nausea/vomiting; and levetiracetam (Keppra), cough; wheezing. The last doses of antibiotics were cefazolin on 07/17/2018 at 08:35 AM, vancomycin on 07/19/2018 at 10:00 PM, and cefepime on 07/19/2018 at 11:28 PM.

Infusions include furosemide (Lasix) started on 07/19/2018 at 11:29 PM and hydromorphone (Dilaudid) started on 07/20/2018 at 05:13 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. Flow sheet data shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), current temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/59 mmHg to 138/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 883 mL and output of 880 mL, resulting in a balance of -3 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and their ABG results are ///26/. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed.

Lab results show white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, sodium of 108 mg/dL, potassium of 0.8 mg/dL, chloride of 26 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 7 mg/dL, BUN of 99 mEq/L, creatinine of 135 mEq/L, glucose of 135 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 1.2 mmol/L. Other labs include PT/PTT/INR of 12.7/29.6/1.1, differential with neutrophils at 84.4%, lymphocytes at 5.5%, monocytes at 9.2%, eosinophils at 0.8%, and calcium/magnesium/phosphate levels.

Assessment and plan include thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture without spinal cord injury, tachycardia, anxiety, and pain control. The patient is at risk for aspiration due to inability to protect their airway and altered gag reflex. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (22 gauge inserted on 07/19/2018 at 08:04 PM and 20 gauge inserted on 07/19/2018 at 10:00 PM), prophylaxis for D"

   bibasilar dependent consolidations.  Her initial acute distress
   resolved with supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments but
   subsequently has worsened.  Overnight she was increased to 70% facemask
   with saturations in the high 90s but with subjective dsypnea and
   tachypnea.  Other potential etiologies on the differential include
   pulmonary embolism although less likley with frank infiltrates on CT as

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma who was admitted for a planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9. Postoperatively, she developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea, and fevers. Chest CT showed evidence of bibasilar dependent consolidations. She initially improved with supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments but subsequently worsened. She was placed on 70% facemask with saturations in the high 90s but still had subjective dyspnea and tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient has symptoms consistent with HAP, including respiratory distress, fevers, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. She is already receiving appropriate antibiotics for this condition.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although less likely, PE should still be considered as a potential etiology given her symptoms of tachycardia and tachypnea. Further evaluation may include imaging studies such as a CT pulmonary angiogram.
3. Lymphangitic spread of tumor: Given the patient's history of metastatic renal carcinoma, there is a possibility of lymphangitic spread of tumor causing respiratory symptoms. This should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
4. Poor pulmonary reserve: The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma who was admitted for a planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9. She developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia postoperatively. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and is now breathing comfortably on 4L nasal canula. She is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. Other medications include dilaudid for pain control, ativan for anxiety, and lasix for potential volume overload. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her blood cultures are pending. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal evidence of bibasilar dependent consolidations consistent with pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and worsening condition despite supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments indicate a high risk for respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and imaging"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma to the brain, spine, and lungs. She was admitted for a planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9. Postoperatively, she developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress with tachypnea and fevers. Chest CT showed bibasilar dependent consolidations. Her acute distress resolved with supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments. She is now breathing comfortably on 4L nasal canula. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has developed symptoms of pneumonia, including fever, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. She is already on antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin) for HAP, but close monitoring and further diagnostic tests (such as chest X-ray or sputum cultures) are necessary to evaluate the response to treatment and detect any worsening of the infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress indicates a risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, particularly respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, is crucial. If the patient's condition worsens, she may require mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobil"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is difficulty breathing, and they have a history of thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture (TLS) without spinal cord injury. The patient is currently experiencing fever, tachycardia, anxiety, and pain control issues. They have allergies to penicillins, morphine, Keppra (Oral), and acetylcysteine. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and cefipime. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and hydromorphone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and blood cultures were taken, indicating a potential infection. The ongoing use of antibiotics suggests that the medical team is concerned about an ongoing or developing infection.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory status is stabilized with the use of 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The presence of pneumonia or lymphangitic spread needs further investigation, as indicated by the consultation with oncology. The patient also exhibits wheezing, which may be related to airway clearance or a possible stridor.

3. Pain management: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain due to their fractures. Pain control is an important aspect of their care, as indicated in the assessment and plan section of"

   Unable to produce sputum sample
   CT NECK: No definite evidence of obstruction in the upper airways.
   CT TORSO:
   1. Bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly at the left lung,
   concerning for pneumonia. Airspace opacity at the right apex, could be
   due to early lymphangitic spread of tumor with metastatic burden here
   increased from prior.

   CT NECK: No definite evidence of obstruction in the upper airways.
   CT TORSO:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly at the left lung,
   concerning
   for pneumonia. Airspace opacity at the right apex, could be due to
   early
   lymphangitic spread of tumor with metastatic burden here increased from
   prior.
   2. Large dependent pleural effusion on the left and small pleural
   effusion on
   the right.
   3. Status post posterior fusion spanning from T5 to T12 with
   appropriate
   anatomic alignment, and no evidence of hardware failure. Intervertebral
   cage
   device between T8 and T9.
   The measurements for the target lesions were updated in the oncology
   table.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 58 year old female with a history of metastatic
   renal caricnoma to the brain, spine and lungs who was admitted for
   planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9 who
   postoperatively has developed fevers, tachycardia and imaging
   suggestive of pneumonia.
   Hospital Acquired Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress:  Patient transferred
   to the ICU for acute respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea
   and fevers.  Chest CT from earlier in the day with evidence of
   bibasilar dependent consolidations.  Her initial acute distress
   resolved with supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments but
   subsequently has worsened.  Overnight she was increased to 70% facemask
   with saturations in the high 90s but with subjective dsypnea and
   tachypnea.  CT torso with pnemonia and dependent effusion in L lung.
   CT neck without obstruction of upper airways.  At baseline patient has
   poor pulmonary reserve s/p mulitple lung resections with mild
   restrictive defect on recent PFTs. .

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma to the brain, spine, and lungs. She was admitted for planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9. Postoperatively, she developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's respiratory distress worsened despite supplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments. She has been transferred to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, tachycardia, and imaging findings, suggest pneumonia. The fact that she is in the ICU indicates that it may be hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's acute respiratory distress resolved initially with supplemental oxygen but subsequently worsened. She requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.
3. Dependent pleural effusion: The CT torso showed a large dependent pleural effusion on the left and a small pleural effusion on the right. These effusions can cause respiratory compromise and may require drainage or additional interventions.
4. Metastatic spread of tumor: The CT torso also showed airspace opacities predominantly at the left lung, which could be due to early lymphangitic spread of tumor with increased metastatic burden. This indicates the possibility of further tumor progression and potential complications related to metastatic disease.
5. Poor pulmonary reserve: The patient has a history of multiple lung"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma to the brain, spine, and lungs. She was admitted for planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9 but developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia postoperatively. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory distress, tachycardia, and fevers. She has been treated with supplemental oxygen, nebulizer treatments, and antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes hospital-acquired pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and lymphangitic spread of tumor. The patient's respiratory status has been stabilized, and she is now on 4L NC. Onc consult has been obtained to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic spread versus pneumonia. Imaging studies, such as a CT chest and neck, have been ordered for better characterization of the lungs and to assess for wheezing/possible stridor. The patient's surgical incision is healing well, and there are no signs of infection or complications at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient is already receiving appropriate treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics, but there is a need for continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygen saturation levels. Regular chest X-rays or CT scans may be necessary to assess the progress of the pneumonia and the response to treatment.

2. Pulmonary embolism: Although less likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma, who was admitted for a planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9. Postoperatively, she developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. She has acute on chronic respiratory failure with superimposed nosocomial pneumonia, possibly due to recent surgery and intubation with multiple lung resections. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin). She also has wheezing/bronchospasm, which may be related to lymphangitic spread or infection. The plan includes incentive spirometry, oxygen therapy as tolerated, blood and sputum cultures, and nebulizer treatments with levo-albuterol and ipratropium every six hours. The patient's tachycardia is attributed to multifocal pneumonia and underlying malignancy, postoperative status. The medical team is monitoring her expectantly and considering transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells if needed. They are also keeping in mind the possibility of a pulmonary embolism as a possible etiology and will work up if clinically indicated. The patient underwent T8 and T9 vertebrectomy and reconstruction, and a physical therapy consult has been requested once her respiratory status stabilizes. She is being managed for post"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma to the brain, spine, and lungs. She was admitted for a planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9. Postoperatively, she developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea, and fevers. She has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia and dependent effusion in her left lung. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is important to monitor her respiratory status closely and continue treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress after transfusion, which improved with the use of lorazepam. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary to prevent further episodes.
3. Anemia: The patient received a blood transfusion due to anemia. Regular monitoring of her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is important to ensure adequate oxygen carrying capacity.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be multifactorial, including acute illness, underlying chronic illness, albuterol use, and anemia. Close monitoring of her heart rate and appropriate interventions are necessary.
5. Peptic Ulcer Disease: The patient has a history of pe"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma to the brain, spine, and lungs. She was admitted for a planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9. Postoperatively, she developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory distress with tachycardia, tachypnea, and fevers. CT torso showed pneumonia and a dependent effusion in the left lung. CT neck did not reveal any obstruction of the upper airways. The patient has poor pulmonary reserve due to multiple lung resections, with a mild restrictive defect on recent pulmonary function tests.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate in the high 120s, blood pressure ranging from 122/56 mmHg to 131/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Physical examination findings include alertness, no acute distress, sclera anicteric, dry mouth with evidence of thrush, supple neck, no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy, wheezing throughout the lungs, tachycardia with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, soft abdomen with bowel sounds"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the brain, spine, and lungs. She was admitted for a planned vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9 but postoperatively developed fevers, tachycardia, and imaging suggestive of pneumonia. The patient is experiencing acute on chronic respiratory failure with superimposed nosocomial pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient has been prescribed vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia. She will be on a 10-day regimen starting from day 3.
2. Wheezing/Bronchospasm: The patient may have wheezing/bronchospasm related to lymphangitic spread or infection. She has been given levo-albuterol and ipratropium nebs standing Q6H, guaifenesin for cough, and narcotic as needed for pain.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be attributed to multifocal pneumonia and underlying malignancy, as well as postoperative status. She has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although less likely at this point, the patient's tachycardia raises concern for PE. Further workup may be necessary if clinically indicated.
