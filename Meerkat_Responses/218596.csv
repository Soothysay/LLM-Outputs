   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to
   lungs on clinic trial, h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted
   for HA, n/v, poor PO intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with
   RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt noted to have SVT this AM and showed A. flutter with RVR
   after receiving Adenosine x 2. Currently in A. Flutter.  Flutter is
   notoriously difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an
   issue cardioversion without TEE would be warranted given a/c on
   lovenox.
   - will bolus 1L NS x 1
   - continue to follow urine output
   - reintroduce PO regimen of Diltiazem 90mg QID and wean off drip
   - will continue Metoprolol 75 TID for now
   - currently on Lovenox
   - continue on tele
   - pt has 2 PIV for access
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  In light of labs inconsistent with
   volume depletion and a drop in Na with IV hydration, and sodium avid
   urine in the face of hyponatremia, (urine Na
 49).  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**]
   lung mets.
   - free water restriction.
   .
   ##. Hypotension: Currently improved with improved rate control
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating clear. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - will increase dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID
   - discuss with oncologist re: anticoagulation history, ?P. Embolism on
   Lovenox and filter
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
   - notify pt's Oncologist of [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission
   - f/u onc recs, if any
   ##. Ppx: Currently on Lovenox S.C. [**Hospital1 **], home regimen of PPI.
   ##. Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis
   that was thought to be related to her admission HA. On review of CT
   scan no signs of sinusitis.
   - will d/c Ceftriaxone
   ##. ACCESS: PIV's
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed FULL CODE
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending resolution of symptoms.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma to the lungs, who is currently on a clinical trial. She was initially admitted for headache, nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. She was then transferred to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response accompanied by hypotension.

The patient has a history of SVT versus AVNRT versus atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. She experienced SVT this morning and showed atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response after receiving adenosine x 2. Currently, she is still in atrial flutter. Flutter is known to be difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an issue, cardioversion without transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) would be warranted given her anticoagulation with Lovenox.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (79-153 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 99/48 mmHg to 129/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (22-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. Her rhythm is atrial flutter with a rate of 125 beats per minute. 

She has received intravenous fluids totaling 5,267 mL since 49 AM, with an output of 875 mL and urine output of 600 mL"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to
   lungs on clinic trial, h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted
   for HA, n/v, poor PO intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with
   RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt noted to have SVT this AM and showed A. flutter with RVR
   after receiving Adenosine x 2. Currently in A. Flutter.  Flutter is
   notoriously difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an
   issue cardioversion without TEE would be warranted given a/c on
   lovenox.
   - continue to follow urine output
   - Stop dilt and metop, start amiodarone, if persistent would d/c
   cardiovert her
   - currently on Lovenox
   - continue on tele
   - pt has 2 PIV for access
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  In light of labs inconsistent with
   volume depletion and a drop in Na with IV hydration, and sodium avid
   urine in the face of hyponatremia, (urine Na
 49).  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**]
   lung mets.
   - 2L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. Hypotension: Currently improved with improved rate control
   - echo shows preserved EF,  no diastolic dysfunction
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating clear. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - will increase dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID
   - discuss with oncologist re: anticoagulation history, ?P. Embolism on
   Lovenox and filter
   .
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.

s input greatly appreciated
   - f/u onc recs, if any
    .
   ##. Ppx: Currently on Lovenox S.C. [**Hospital1 **], home regimen of PPI.
   .
   ##. Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis
   that was thought to be related to her admission HA. On review of CT
   scan no signs of sinusitis.
   - will d/c Ceftriaxone
   ##. ACCESS: PIV's
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed FULL CODE
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending resolution of symptoms.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma to the lungs. She has been admitted for symptoms including headache, nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. The patient was initially admitted for hypertension and later transferred to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response accompanied by hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (with a range of 79-153 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 99/48 mmHg to 129/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (with a range of 22-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on respiratory support through a nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for which she had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed. She is currently on enoxaparin (Lovenox) for anticoagulation. 

Laboratory results show hyponatremia (sodium level of 112 mEq/L), elevated potassium level (K+ of 5.7 mEq/L), and a slightly elevated creatinine level (Cr of 1.2 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt noted to have SVT this AM and showed A. flutter with RVR
   after receiving Adenosine x 2. Currently in A. Flutter.  Flutter is
   notoriously difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an
   issue cardioversion without TEE would be warranted given a/c on
   lovenox.
   - continue to follow urine output
   - started amiodarone, adding back dilt. For better rate control.
   - if persistently difficult to rate control would d/c cardiovert her
   - currently on Lovenox
   - continue on tele
   - pt has 2 PIV for access
   .
   ##Fever
 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative.  She
   is febrile in the absence of leukocytosis.  Other possible etiologies
   are DVT
s given that she has had them through her lovenox in the past.
   Another possible source is her Melanoma itself.
   - LENI

   -CT abd/pelvis with contrast to look for mets.

   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  In light of labs inconsistent with
   volume depletion and a drop in Na with IV hydration, and sodium avid
   urine in the face of hyponatremia, (urine Na
 49).  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**]
   lung mets.
   - 1.5L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. Hypotension: Currently improved with improved rate control
   - echo shows preserved EF,  no diastolic dysfunction
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating clear. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn

   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - will increase dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID
   - discuss with oncologist re: anticoagulation history, ?P. Embolism on
   Lovenox and filter
   .
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma to the lungs and previous deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). She was initially admitted for headache, nausea/vomiting, and poor oral intake. She was then transferred to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response accompanied by hypotension.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. Atrial Flutter with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) versus atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) versus atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. She experienced SVT in the morning and was found to have atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response after receiving adenosine x 2. The flutter is difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an issue, cardioversion without transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) would be considered given the presence of low-molecular-weight heparin (Lovenox).

2. Fever: The patient is febrile in the absence of leukocytosis. Possible etiologies include DVT, given her previous history of DVT while on Lovenox, and metastatic melanoma. A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is ordered to look for metastasis.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt continues in constant flutter with rates poorly controlled
   on amio and dilt gtt. BP has been stable and pt asymptomatic. Has
   better chance of converting electrically. Will discuss cardioversion
   without TEE since on Lovenox.
   - consult cards for cardioversion today and question if TEE necessary
   - cont Lovenox
   .
   ##Fever
 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative and
   no symptoms of infection.  Afebrile now for 24 hours.  possible source
   is her Melanoma itself.
   - LENI
s neg for DVT
   - discuss with onc CT abd/pelvis with contrast to look for mets.
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**] lung mets.
   Appears euvolemic and sodium improved with fluid restriction.
   - 1.5L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - cont Lovenox 150 SC BID
   .
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]
s input greatly appreciated
   - f/u onc recs, if any
    .
   ##. Ppx: Currently on Lovenox S.C. [**Hospital1 **], home regimen of PPI.
   .
   ##. Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis
   that was thought to be related to her admission HA. On review of CT
   scan no signs of sinusitis.
   - D/Ced Ceftriaxone
   ##. ACCESS: PIV's
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed FULL CODE
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending resolution of symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt continues in constant flutter with rates poorly controlled
   on amio and dilt gtt. BP has been stable and pt asymptomatic. Has
   better chance of converting electrically. Will discuss cardioversion
   without TEE since presented in sinus and was on therapeutic dose
   Lovenox within 24 hours from admission.
   - attempt DC cardioversion today
   - cont Lovenox
   .
   ##Fever
 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative and
   no symptoms of infection.  Afebrile now for 24 hours.  possible source
   is her Melanoma itself.
   - LENI
s neg for DVT
   - discuss with onc CT abd/pelvis with contrast to look for mets.
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**] lung mets.
   Appears euvolemic and sodium improved with fluid restriction.
   - 1.5L free water restriction.
   - if remains today, will give IVF to maintain this fluid goal
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Compazine, Zofran prn
   - add Reglan and Ativan prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - cont Lovenox 150 SC BID
   .
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   clinical trial.
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]
s input greatly appreciated
   - f/u onc recs, if any
    .
   ##. Ppx: Currently on Lovenox S.C. [**Hospital1 **], home regimen of PPI.
   .
   ##. Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis
   that was thought to be related to her admission HA. On review of CT
   scan no signs of sinusitis.
   - D/Ced Ceftriaxone
   ##. ACCESS: PIV's
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed FULL CODE
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending resolution of symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, who was initially admitted for headache, nausea, and poor oral intake. She was transferred to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hypotension. The patient continues in constant atrial flutter with rates poorly controlled on amiodarone and diltiazem infusions. Her blood pressure has been stable, and she is asymptomatic. She has a history of SVT vs AVNRT vs atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. It is believed that she has a better chance of converting electrically. Full code status was confirmed, and a discussion took place regarding cardioversion without transesophageal echocardiography since she presented in sinus rhythm and was on therapeutic dose Lovenox within 24 hours from admission. 

The patient's fever has resolved, and her urine analysis was negative. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism even while on Lovenox. She was previously on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation but discontinued after episodes of hemoptysis. She will continue on Lovenox. 

The patient is suspected to have small cell lung cancer (SIADH) due to hyponatremia and concentrated urine. She appears euvolemic, and her sodium improved with fluid restriction. A 1.5L free water restriction was implemented, and if it remains today,"

   Patient continues in rapid rate with what is likely afib/flutter.
   Carotid sinus massage this AM on rounds had no effect re: blocking down
   the rate. She has been fully loaded with amiodarone. I think we are now
   at the point that we need to consider electrical cardioversion. Patient
   on lovanox, although was not at full anticoagulation doses for awhile.
   Will check with cardiology re: TEE pre-cardioversion.
   Patient very hesitant to eat; still has mild nausea despite
   anti-emetics. Consider metaclopramide if it hasn't been tried recently.
   Hyponatremia stable.
   Addendum: cardiology consulted. They indicated that she does not need
   delay in cardioversion for TEE if she was in a sinus rhythm when
   admitted to the hospital and high dose lovanox started within 24 hours
   after initiation of afib/flutter.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Patient cardioverted yesterday, successfully.  BP has been
   stable and pt asymptomatic.  Currently only on amiodarone.
   -Cont. Amiodarone
   .
   #Sinus Tachycardia: After Cardioversion patient has been in sinus
   tachycardia, unresponsive to a 1 liter fluid bolus.  Patient is not in
   pain, afebrile, and none of her cultures are positive, and CXR
s are
   negative.  Chest CT to evaluate for disease progression,
   post-obstructive PNA, atypical PNA.
   - ? cytokine effect from underlying malignancy, vs untreated infection
   (sinusitis vs atypical PNA vs Viral URI).
   .
   ##Fever
 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative and
   no symptoms of infection.  Afebrile now for 24 hours.  possible source
   is her Melanoma itself.  Infectious etiologies include above.
   - LENI
s neg for DVT
   - discuss with onc CT abd/pelvis with contrast to look for mets.
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**] lung mets.
   Appears euvolemic and sodium had improved with fluid restriction, and
   worsened with IVF bolus overnight
   - 1.5L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Compazine, Zofran prn
   - add Reglan and Ativan prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - cont Lovenox 150 SC BID
   .
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   clinical trial.
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]
s input greatly appreciated
   - f/u onc recs, if any
    .
   ##. Ppx: Currently on Lovenox S.C. [**Hospital1 **], home regimen of PPI.
   .
   ##. Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis
   that was thought to be related to her admission HA. On review of CT
   scan no signs of sinusitis.
   - D/Ced Ceftriaxone

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs and a history of DVT/PE. She was admitted initially for headache, nausea/vomiting, and poor oral intake. She was transferred to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response accompanied by hypotension.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Atrial Flutter with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and atrial flutter with RVR. She was successfully cardioverted yesterday, and her blood pressure has been stable since then. She is currently only on amiodarone.

2. Sinus Tachycardia: After cardioversion, the patient has been in sinus tachycardia, which is unresponsive to a 1-liter fluid bolus. The patient does not appear to be in pain, is afebrile, and none of her cultures are positive. The possible cause of sinus tachycardia could be a cytokine effect from underlying malignancy.

3. Fever: The patient had a fever, but her urine analysis (UA) was negative, all other culture data is negative, and she does not show any symptoms of infection. The possible source of fever could be her melanoma"

   is not in pain, afebrile, and none of her cultures are positive, and
   CXR
s are negative.  Chest CT shows worsening malignancy but no PNA.
   One possibility is cytokine release and inflammatory response from
   chemotherapy (since it enhances immune response in general in order to
   kill malignant cells)
   - treat empirically for sinusitis with Levaquin (D2/5)
   - if no improvement, may atrribute to cytokine response from underlying
   malignancy

   ##. N/V: Initial N/V was consistent with viral gastroenteritis. Her
   other work-up has included CT head which was negative for any masses.
   CT abd/pelvis was negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology
   such as ileus, extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign. Current
   issue is anorexia more than N/V.

   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs and a history of DVT/PE. She was initially admitted for headaches, nausea/vomiting, and poor oral intake. The patient was transferred to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hypotension.

Medical conditions and potential complications:

1. Hypopituitarism: The patient has low AM cortisol and low TSH, which is concerning for a pituitary process. A study drug for her melanoma can apparently cause hypopituitarism. PRL was normal, T4 was borderline low, and IGF-1 pending. An endocrine consult is recommended.

2. Atrial Flutter with RVR: The patient has a history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter with RVR. She was successfully cardioverted, and her blood pressure has been stable and asymptomatic. Amiodarone (D3 at 400 mg TID) is continued.

3. Sinus Tachycardia/Leukocytosis: After cardioversion, the patient has been in sinus tachycardia, unresponsive to a 1-liter fluid bolus. One possibility is cytokine release and inflammatory response from chemotherapy. The patient is being treated empirically for sinusitis with Levaquin (D2/5).
