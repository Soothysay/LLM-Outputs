   HPI:
   62 yo M admitted with AMS after being discharged yesterday from
   neurosurgical service.  He was admitted on [**1-9**] from [**Location (un) **] s/p fall
   down a flight of stairs and had an moderate SDH, also with bilateral
   wrist fractures.
   Hospital course then c/b an NSTEMI that was medically managed.  He had
   persistent AMS (lethargic, but opening eyes) and trach and PEG were
   placed.  Per d/c summary, his MS never improved as it should have based
   on his objective imaging.  The day prior to discharge family reports he
   was more lethargic and had low grade fevers.  Also had thick trach
   secretions that were sent for cx day of discharge.
   He went to the [**Hospital1 1939**] yesterday and per family, never really woke
   up.  He was transferred back to [**Hospital1 1**] ED this morning at 8am.
   In the ED: T:102.8 (rectal) BP:116/66 HR:80-100's RR:15-22 100% on 50%
   trach mask (baseline).  CT head was unchanged.  CXR showed old ?
   retrocardiac opacity seen on CXR on [**1-22**].  UA negative.  Some drainage
   around PEG tube.  Labs with leukocytosis to 11.7 and left shift.  Given
   vanco, aztreonam and levo for hospital-acquired PNA. RUQ u/s ordered.
   EKG with new LBBB but CE negative, felt to be result of NSTEMI from
   prior hospitalization.
   On arrival to the ICU patient is awake and alert, unable to speak given
   trach.  Does not follow commands or appear to understand his daughter
   who translates for team.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) after being discharged from the neurosurgical service. He had a fall down a flight of stairs and sustained a moderate subdural hematoma, as well as bilateral wrist fractures. The patient also experienced an NSTEMI that was medically managed. He had persistent AMS, and tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were placed. The patient's mental status did not improve as expected based on objective imaging. On the day prior to discharge, the patient became more lethargic, had low-grade fevers, and thick tracheal secretions.

Upon transfer to the ICU, the patient presented with a temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg, heart rate of 80-100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% tracheal mask. A CT scan of the head showed no changes, and a chest X-ray revealed an old retrocardiac opacity seen on January 22nd. Laboratory results indicated leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL and left shift. The patient was started on vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). An ultrasound of the right upper"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of bilateral wrist fractures, altered mental status, pneumonia, anemia, liver function abnormalities, and hyponatremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pulmonary infection. The patient's condition remains unstable, and further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and the recent chest X-ray showed retrocardiac opacity. There is a concern for ongoing pulmonary infection, which may require adjustment in antibiotic coverage.
2. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible biliary source of infection. Further evaluation, including abdominal ultrasound and hepatic serologies, is necessary to identify the cause.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has declined significantly, and imaging studies have shown small strokes. However, the cause of his altered mental status remains unclear. Additional neurologic consultations and imaging may be required to determine the underlying cause.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which could be due to excessive free water administration. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is crucial to prevent complications such as seizures.
5. Bilateral Wrist Fractures: The patient sustained bilateral wrist fractures during a fall. These fractures are currently being managed with casts, and orthoped"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications. The note highlights several conditions and potential medical complications:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever with a temperature of 102.8 rectally. This indicates an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body.

2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is not delirium. AMS can be caused by various factors, including infection, electrolyte imbalances, or neurological issues.

3. Pneumonia: The patient likely has pneumonia, as indicated by thick secretions in the tracheostomy tube, rhonchi on examination, and ill-defined retrocardiac opacity on the chest X-ray.

4. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, with elevated ALT and AST levels. This could be due to various causes such as medication, infection, or biliary obstruction.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, with a baseline in the high 300s. It is likely acute and related to the current illness.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 127. This could be due to excessive free water intake or inadequate fluid restriction.

7. Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB): The patient has an old LBBB, which is intermittent and associated with a previous NSTEMI during a previous admission.

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, and bilateral wrist fractures. The patient has a history of anemia, liver function abnormalities, pneumonia aspiration, and fractures. On admission, the patient had an elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, blood pressure ranging from 106/60 mmHg to 116/74 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected infection, and there are ongoing investigations for the cause of his altered mental status. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total input of 3,199 mL and output of 2,450 mL. The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeds, which were temporarily held due to elevated lipase levels. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's neurological examination shows a first-degree AV block, and the peripheral vascular examination reveals absent pulses in both upper and lower extremities. The abdominal examination is not assessed. The patient has thick secretions in the tracheostomy tube and rhonchi on lung auscultation. The chest X-ray shows an ill-defined retrocardiac opacity. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions including seizure disorder, VP shunt, and bilateral wrist fractures. The patient has been experiencing various complications during his stay in the ICU. These include an elevated lipase level leading to the holding of tube feeds, conjunctivitis treated with bacitracin/polymyxin ointment, and a change in antiepileptic medication from dilantin to keppra based on neuro recommendations. An EEG and neuro consult were ordered.

The patient has allergies to iodine and penicillins, with a rash being the reported reaction. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature range of 37.6 to 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 81 and 99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/60 to 116/74 mmHg, respiratory rate between 24 and 41 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,199 mL with an output of 2,450 mL, resulting in a deficit of 749 mL. The patient's weight remains relatively unchanged since admission.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated lip"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. The patient has a history of allergies to iodine and penicillins. He has received antibiotics, specifically meropenem and vancomycin, in the past. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/57 mmHg to 120/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's weight is 68.5 kg, and his height is 68 inches. He has received a total of 3,199 mL of fluids since admission, with an output of 2,450 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a tracheostomy mask and has an ABG showing pH of 7.23. Physical examination reveals thin appearance, normocephalic tracheostomy site, normal heart sounds, rhonchorous breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and non-purposeful movements. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's sodium levels have improved compared to yesterday. There are concerns about possible infection, hyponatremia, and thrombocytosis. The patient has a history of bilateral wrist fractures."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male visiting from [Country 2482] with a history of parietal lobe infarct, pineal schwannoma, seizure disorder, and TIAs. He was admitted with altered mental status, foul-smelling thick tracheal secretions, and after recent discharge from neurosurgery (s/p fall down stairs with SDH and bilateral wrist fractures). Prior hospital course included NSTEMI medically managed. The patient continues to have altered mental status, which may be due to infection or residual effects of a head injury. There were possible seizure activities on the night of admission. The patient has known seizure disorder, VP shunt, and left facial droop.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has thick tracheal secretions, rhonchi on examination, and an ill-defined retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray. These findings suggest a possible pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics have been started, and daily blood cultures are being obtained until the patient is afebrile.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are elevated. The cause of transaminitis is unclear, but it could be related to recent use of Dilantin, which has since been discontinued. Statin medication has been held, and efforts will be made to resume Pravastatin.
3. EKG changes: The patient initially had a left bundle branch block on admission"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction, anemia, liver function abnormalities, pneumonia, altered mental status, fever, and fractures in both wrists. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced changes in EKG with new STE in inferior leads, and cardiology was consulted. The patient was given ASA/Plavix, Pravastatin, and a beta-blocker, but Pravastatin was not administered due to elevated liver function tests. Heparin gtt was discontinued, and there are no plans for cath lab intervention as the cause of EKG changes remains unclear.
- Neurology was consulted, and they are okay with heparin gtt if indicated by cardiology but would like a repeat head CT in 24 hours after it started. The head CT is currently stable, and the EEG result is pending.
- Daily EKGs will be done for now, and the neuro recommendations include Keppra and Phenobarb + EEG.
- There are pending nutrition recommendations for tube feeds, which the general surgeon has approved, and the PEG tube feeds will be initiated. A stitch will be placed to stop drainage this morning.
- The central line (PICC) was ordered due to poor peripheral IV access with bilateral casts, and IV medications will be administered through it.
- A trial with PMV - trach was attempted, but it was too"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of parietal lobe infarct, pineal schwannoma, seizure disorder, and transient ischemic attacks. He was admitted with altered mental status after falling down a flight of stairs and sustaining a moderate subdural hematoma (SDH) and bilateral wrist fractures. The patient's last hospital course was complicated by a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which was medically managed.

The patient continues to have altered mental status, described as lethargic but opening his eyes and answering yes/no. He also presented with thick, foul-smelling tracheostomy (trach) secretions. The differential diagnosis for the altered mental status includes infection versus residual effects of the head injury. The patient had an event possibly consistent with seizure activity on the night of admission.

The patient is currently being covered with vancomycin and [Last Name (un) 1540] for now (Day 3). The neurology recommendations include continuing with phenobarbital and levetiracetam (Keppra). An electroencephalogram (EEG) has been ordered and will be followed up on.

The patient is afebrile since arrival to the emergency department (ED), likely due to previous pneumonia given the thick secretions, rhonchi on examination, and chest X-ray showing an ill-defined retrocardiac opacity. Antibiotics"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status after experiencing a fall down stairs, resulting in a subdural hematoma (SDH) and bilateral wrist fractures. The patient has a history of parietal lobe infarct, pineal schwannoma, seizure disorder, and TIAs. He was previously discharged from the hospital following medical management for NSTEMI.

Upon admission, the patient presented with AMS, which has persisted according to the family. He also has thick, foul-smelling tracheostomy (trach) secretions. The patient had an event possibly c/w seizure activity on the night of admission. He has known seizure disorder and a VP shunt.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/62 to 123/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral facial droop and left lower extremity weakness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Kidney function is within normal limits, with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male from [Country 2482] who was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), foul-smelling thick tracheostomy (trach) secretions, and a history of a recent discharge from the neurosurgery department following a fall resulting in a subdural hematoma (SDH) and bilateral wrist fractures. He has a background of a parietal lobe infarct, pineal schwannoma, remote ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, seizure disorder (sz d/o), and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).

The patient's current condition includes:
- Asking questions and aware of his surroundings, but poorly following commands.
- Left facial droop.
- Thick, foul-smelling trach secretions.
- Recent EKG changes with ST elevations in the inferior leads, but cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.
- On appropriate cardiac medications including aspirin, Plavix, and a low-dose beta blocker.
- Abnormal liver function tests (transaminitis), which are stable since yesterday.
- Hyponatremia, which is resolving.
- Bilateral wrist fractures in casts.
- Thrombocytosis, likely an acute phase reactant.
- No fever since arrival.
- Potential pneumonia given the thick secretions, rhonchi on exam, and an ill-defined retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male visiting from [Country 2482] with a history of parietal lobe infarct, pineal schwannoma, remote VP shunt, seizure disorder, and previous admission for NSTEMI. He was admitted with altered mental status, foul-smelling thick tracheal secretions, and recent discharge from neurosurgery following a fall down stairs with subdural hematoma and bilateral wrist fractures. The patient has been experiencing mild encephalopathy, language barrier, and impaired arousal, attention, cognition, balance, muscle performance, motor function, and transfers. He also has a history of myocardial infarction, anemia, liver function abnormalities, pneumonia aspiration, altered mental status, fever, fracture, and bilateral wrist fractures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been treated for infection, specifically with antibiotics targeting Neisseria meningitidis in the sputum culture. There is concern for meningitis, but the value of lumbar puncture is questionable due to ongoing antibiotic therapy.
2. Seizure: The patient had an event possibly consistent with seizure activity on the night of admission. He has known seizure disorder, and treatment for seizures is ongoing.
3. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of NSTEMI medically managed previously. EKG changes with ST elevations inferior leads were noted, but cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. The patient"

   activity. Has known sz d/o, VP shunt, left-facial droop. Given
   Neisseria in sputum cx, concern for meningitis, but value of LP
   questionable this far into abx therapy. Cefepime and Vanc at meningitic
   doses, risk of crossreactivity with his PCN allergy noted.
   - Touch base with neuro and neurosurg re: value of obtaining CSF for
   analysis
   - C/w vanco (day 1=[**1-24**]), cefepime (day 1=[**1-27**])
   - Continue with phenobarb and Keppra
   - f/u EEG
   - Continue Thiamine, Folate, Multivitamin
   # Fever & Trach Secretions: Persistently afebrile. Fewer secretions,
   continues to have rhonchi on exam. Imaging concerning for CAP vs HAP.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male visiting from another country with a history of a parietal lobe infarct, pineal schwannoma, remote VP shunt, seizure disorder, and TIAs. He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), foul-smelling thick tracheal secretions, after recent discharge from neurosurgery (following a fall down stairs with subdural hematoma and bilateral wrist fractures). His prior hospital course includes a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) that was medically managed. The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Myocardial Infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
- Anemia, other
- Liver function abnormalities
- Pneumonia, aspiration
- Fracture, other (bilateral wrist fractures)

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and ongoing cardiac enzyme monitoring is necessary. The plan for conservative medical management should be continued.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's mild decrease in sodium levels needs to be closely monitored due to altered mental status. Decreasing free water flushes and monitoring electrolytes is appropriate. Further characterization of hyponatremia may be required if it persists.
3. Infection: The patient has persistent fever and tracheal secretions, with a sputum culture positive for Neisseria meningitidis."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of parietal lobe infarct, pineal schwannoma, remote VP shunt, seizure disorder, and TIAs. The patient was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), foul-smelling thick tracheal secretions, after recent discharge from neurosurgery (s/p fall down stairs with SDH and bilateral wrist fractures). Prior hospital course included NSTEMI medically managed.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI), Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient has a history of NSTEMI medically managed in the past, and recent EKG changes with ST elevations inferior leads on EKG yesterday morning. However, cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and the patient is asymptomatic. The plan for now is conservative medical management.

2. Anemia, Other: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) on multiple occasions. Viral hepatitis serologies are negative, and the liver function tests continue to trend down. Possible causes include medications such as Dilantin or Statin, both of which have been discontinued.

4. Pneumonia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   62-year-old man with complex neurologic history (including VP shunt),
   s/p recent trauma admission with wrist fractures and SDH, now with
   ongoing encephalopathy felt most likely related to SDH/infection
   (pneumonia).  Appreciate neurology
s help.  On antiepileptics.  At this
   point, I think that CSF sampling risks outweigh benefits since he has
   been on antibiotics for several days and therapy similar.  Present ABX
   also adequate therapy for HCAP.  Transaminitis presumptively attributed
   to Dilantin or statin, but if recurs will need follow-up and
   potentially further evaluation.  For acute myocardial infarction, we
   are treating medically (given risk of bleeding if taken to cath, as
   well as likelihood of not finding an intervenable culprit lesion).
   Wrist fractures are being followed by ortho, whose help is
   appreciated.  Anticipate conservative management.
   Ready for transfer to the floor.

   Disposition :Transfer to floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a complex neurologic history and recent trauma admission. He has ongoing encephalopathy, which is likely related to a subdural hematoma (SDH) and infection (pneumonia). The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, antiepileptics, and being managed medically for an acute myocardial infarction due to the risk of bleeding and uncertainty about finding an intervenable culprit lesion. He also has wrist fractures being managed conservatively by orthopedics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his neurological status remains a concern.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening of encephalopathy and potential progression to multiorgan dysfunction.
2. Development of further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
3. Progression of myocardial infarction or development of new cardiac complications.
4. Complications related to the wrist fractures, such as non-union or malunion.
5. Transaminitis worsening or development of acute liver injury.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's neurological status, infection parameters, cardiac function, and any signs of complications from the wrist fractures. Regular reassessment and appropriate management strategies should be implemented to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."
