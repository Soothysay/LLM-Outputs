   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg tid for now
   - check phenytoin level in a.m.; most recent level 22.5; goal 15-20
   - EEG
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap--could be due to
   good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely due to
   recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out infection.
   - continue insulin gtt
   - aggressive NS resuscitation until FS < 200, after which D5 1/2 NS
   will be given
   - q1hr FS
   - q4hr chemistry
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue empiric CTX, vanco, acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   - maintain ventilatory support for now
   - will wean off once underlying seizure and hyperglycemia resolve

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM, seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was admitted after being found with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Her recent medical events include the placement of a presep catheter, administration of antibiotics, and initiation of various IV infusions. The patient's vital signs indicate a slight increase in temperature, normal blood pressure, increased heart rate, and normal respiratory rate. She is intubated and sedated, with stable pupils, regular heart rhythm, clear lung sounds, soft abdomen, and trace edema. Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's assessment and plan include the diagnosis of DKA, respiratory failure, and seizure, along with ongoing treatment for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics empirically, indicating a suspicion of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or worsening respiratory status, is important.
2. Seizure recurrence: Despite being on phenytoin, the patient may still be at risk for recurrent seizures. Continuous monitoring for seizure activity is necessary.
3. Hyperglycemia and DKA: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored"

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA, or SDH.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg IV Q 8hrs
 corrected level this am 25
   - check phenytoin level tomorrow am
   - EEG results pending
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs
   - F/U final read MRI. Prelim read- tiny subdural left parietal region
   without mass effect on the underlying brain. No evidence for acute
   ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap (now 5)--could
   be due to good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely
   due to recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out
   infection.
   - ISS
   - Cont NS at 150cc/hr for now
   - FS per protocol.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. SDH could be from activity during seizure or could have
   preceded AMS.  Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status
   -          Pt currently doing well on PS 8, PEEP 5
   -          Attempt extubation today- will need to lighten sedation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder, hypertension, patent foramen ovale, transient ischemic attack, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was admitted after being found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria with a normal anion gap.

The patient's current conditions include subdural hemorrhage (SDH), seizure without status epilepticus, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). 

The plan includes continuing phenytoin 100 mg IV every 8 hours, with a corrected level this morning at 25. The phenytoin level will be checked tomorrow morning, and EEG results are pending. Seizure precautions will be maintained, and the patient will follow up with neuro recommendations. The final read MRI showed a tiny subdural left parietal region without mass effect on the underlying brain and no evidence for acute ischemia.

For hyperglycemia, the patient's history of DM2 and recent medication non-compliance are considered. It is also necessary to rule out infection. Insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control, and further investigations such as HSV PCR, blood culture, and urine culture will be followed up.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder, hypertension, patent foramen ovale, transient ischemic attack, and remote history of viral encephalitis. She was admitted after experiencing a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria with a normal anion gap.

The patient's current medical conditions include subdural hemorrhage, seizure without status epilepticus, diabetic ketoacidosis, and acute respiratory failure. The subdural hemorrhage is confirmed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which also revealed a left parietal subdural hematoma. The seizure may have been triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance, meningitis/encephalitis, or diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient is currently on phenytoin 100 mg three times a day, and her phenytoin level will be checked at 9:00 AM with a goal of 15-20.

The hyperglycemia is likely due to recent medication non-compliance and needs to be managed aggressively with intravenous fluids until fasting blood sugar (FS) is below 200. Afterward, the patient will be given D5 1/2 NS (5% dextrose in half-normal saline) and monitored with q1hr (every one hour) FS and q4hr (every four hours) chemistry.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3169**] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of type II DM,
   seizure disorder, HTN, PFO, TIA, remote history of viral encephalitis,
   who was admitted after being found at home with a generalized
   tonic-clonic seizure, also found to have hyperglycemia and glucosuria
   with a normal anion gap.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure: might be triggered by antiepileptic non-compliance,
   meningitis/encephalitis, DKA, or SDH.
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg IV Q 12 hrs
 corrected level yest 25.
   Awaiting results of todays labs
   - EEG results pending
   - seizure precautions
   - f/u neuro recs- will need rpt CT head on Mon to f/u SDH
   - F/U final read MRI. Prelim read- tiny subdural left parietal region
   without mass effect on the underlying brain. No evidence for acute
   ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: with history of DM2. FS 500s on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 **], with ketonuria, but has never had an anion gap (now 8)--could
   be due to good renal clearance of ketoacids. Arterial pH 7.47. Likely
   due to recent medication non-compliance. Also need to rule out
   infection.
   - ISS
   - Cont D5NS at 150cc/hr for now
   - FS per protocol.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to seizure coupled with
   possible DKA. SDH could be from activity during seizure or could have
   preceded AMS.  Could also be due to infections, metabolic derangements.
   LP shows elevated protein but an unremarkable WBC of 3 and glucose of
   240 do not suggest an infectious etiology; however, serum glucose was
   already elevated.
   - treat seizure and hyperglycemia as above
   - f/u HSV PCR, blood cx, urine cx
   - continue acyclovir for now
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: from altered mental status. Pt successfully
   extubated yesterday and doing well on RA. Will continue to monitor.
   FEN- IVF, replete PRN- will discuss advancing diet today

","The patient's chief complaint is seizures and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder, hypertension, patent foramen ovale, transient ischemic attack, and remote history of viral encephalitis.

The patient was admitted after being found at home with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and hyperglycemia with glucosuria but normal anion gap. On admission, the patient had altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, subdural hemorrhage (SDH), respiratory failure, and DKA.

The plan includes continuing phenytoin for seizure management, awaiting results of today's labs, seizure precautions, follow-up neuro recommendations (including a head CT on Monday to monitor SDH), and a final read MRI. The hyperglycemia is likely due to recent medication non-compliance and should be managed with insulin. The altered mental status is most likely due to the seizure coupled with possible DKA, and further investigations such as HSV PCR, blood culture, and urine culture should be done.

The respiratory failure is from altered mental status, and the patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is doing well on RA. The patient will continue to be monitored, and plans include advancing the diet today, providing prophylactic heparin, and discussing the possibility of transferring the patient to the floor."
