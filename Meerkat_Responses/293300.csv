","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency.
- She has been hospitalized previously for hepatic encephalopathy.
- The patient presents with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly hyponatremic.
- Other findings include leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, and potential complications such as infection, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypomagnesemia.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities, including cirrhosis, diabetes, and adrenal insufficiency.
- Treatment plans include IV fluids for sodium and calcium correction, blood and urine cultures, holding oxycodone and neurontin, placing a nasogastric tube, administering rifaximin and lactulose, and conducting urine and blood tox screens.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, suggesting a possible infection. Broad differential diagnoses include urinary tract infection (UTI), Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and atypical pneumonia (APNA). Blood and urine cultures have been ordered to investigate further.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy, worsening of this condition is a concern. Rifaximin and lactulose have been prescribed to manage hepatic encephalopathy.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Altered mental status: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and is currently experiencing altered mental status. This can be caused by various factors such as hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, infections, medication side effects, or worsening hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has profound hyponatremia which needs to be corrected carefully to prevent complications like seizures or permanent neurological damage. Rapid correction of sodium levels should be avoided.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has improved from hyperkalemia but still requires monitoring. High potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels which may require further evaluation and treatment. High calcium levels can cause kidney stones, bone demineralization, and abnormal heart rhythms.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. This requires further investigation with blood and urine cultures, among other tests.

6. Tachycardia: The patient has a fast heart rate, which could be due to dehydration, low-grade fever, or opiate withdrawal. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet levels, which can increase the risk of"

   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors and sodium also improved. WBC is elevated,
   concerning for possible underlying infection. No ascites to tap per
   ultrasound report. Worsened hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a
   concern given recent hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible
   precipitant of encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest
   meningitis. She is on multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone
   and neurontin, which may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS
   bleeding and seizure seems unlikely. MI also less likely.
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - hold oxycodone and neurontin
   - place NGT
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - urine and blood tox screens
   - will HOLD on LP for now given multiple other possible explanations
   for somnolence that are more likely for her
   - hold on ABG as MS improving
   - Attempt to obtain patient
s baseline MS from recent team on the floor
   .
   * Hyponatremia
   Na corrected rapidly post 2L of saline in ER yesterday, remained stable
   overnight
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for now
   - Goal I/O even
   .
   * Tachycardia
   Telemetry c/w sinus tach. Probably multifactorial with dehydration, and
   now also low grade temps. Consider whether opiate withdrawal could be
   contributing.
   - IVF plan as above, acetaminophen<2g/day okay for fever, continue to
   follow with infectious workup as below
   * Leukocytosis
   Suggests possible infection. CXR without evidence of pna. Could be
   atypical pna, may also mask infiltrate in setting of dehydration. Broad
   DDX including UTI, C diff given recent hospitalization. UA without any
   pyuria to suggest UTI. Absence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound
   making SBP less likely
   - Blood and urine cultures, urine legionella, CIS. sputum if making any
   - Follow CBC
   - Change abx to levo/flagyl for possible HAP/aspiration PNA

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She was recently hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy and is now presenting with altered mental status. The patient's sodium levels are significantly low, and her calcium levels are elevated. She also has leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, and a possible ileus. The patient is currently on multiple sedating medications, which may be contributing to her altered mental state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's profound hyponatremia needs to be closely monitored and corrected carefully to prevent complications such as seizures or cerebral edema.
2. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels require monitoring and management to prevent complications such as kidney stones or bone demineralization.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests possible infection, which needs to be investigated further through cultures and appropriate antibiotics.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels require close monitoring and treatment to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Ileus: The patient's dilated bowel on CXR and KUB indicating ileus should be closely monitored for any signs of bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Wrist pain: The patient's wrist pain and known osteoporosis should be evaluated further, and appropriate management should be implemented to prevent further complications.
7. Cirrhosis: The patient's worsening cirrhosis with a MELD score of 16 requires ongoing monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's stable platelet count should be monitored for any significant changes.
9. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes should be managed with insulin sliding scale to maintain blood sugar control.
10. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's secondary adrenal insufficiency should be managed with continued home prednisone to prevent adrenal crisis.
11. Asthma: The patient's asthma should be managed with home inhalers.
12. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain should be addressed, and opiates should be used cautiously due to the altered mental status.

The patient's complex medical history and current presentation require close monitoring and interdisciplinary care to manage the various potential complications and optimize her health outcome."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with altered mental status, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. The patient's current medications include insulin, dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, and other ICU medications. The patient received a lactulose enema overnight and was treated for hyperkalemia with insulin/glucose, bicarbonate, and kayexalate. The patient's sodium levels were corrected with 2 liters of saline from the emergency department.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, the altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition occurs when the liver is unable to adequately remove toxins from the blood, leading to cognitive impairment.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving insulin and dextrose, which can cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Insulin can lower blood sugar too much, leading to hypoglycemia.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is elevated at 10.4 mg/dL. Hypercalcemia can cause various symptoms, including confusion, constipation, and kidney dysfunction.
4. Hyperkalemia: Although the patient was treated for hyperkalemia overnight, there is still a risk of potassium levels becoming imbalanced again, especially if"

   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors. WBC is elevated, concerning for possible
   underlying infection. No ascites to tap per ultrasound report. Worsened
   hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a concern given recent
   hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible precipitant of
   encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest meningitis. She is on
   multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone and neurontin, which
   may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS bleeding and seizure
   seems unlikely. MI also less likely.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for hepatic encephalopathy and is currently experiencing altered mental status. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status: This can be attributed to several factors, including hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, underlying infection, hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects (such as oxycodone and neurontin), or other causes. 

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can contribute to altered mental status. The sodium levels have been corrected rapidly, and further management involves monitoring and potentially adjusting IV fluids.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, likely due to dehydration and low-grade fever. It is also possible that opiate withdrawal may be contributing to the tachycardia. IV fluids and acetaminophen have been started, and an infectious workup is ongoing.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Further investigations are planned, including blood and urine cultures, to identify the source of infection.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels were initially elevated but have improved. Management involves continuing with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, profound hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia. She also has leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, dilated bowel on CXR, wrist pain, and a MELD score of 16 indicating advanced liver disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered mental status: This could be due to various factors including hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, infection, hepatic encephalopathy, medication side effects, or other underlying causes. It is important to address the possible etiologies and treat accordingly.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are significantly low, which can cause confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected carefully. Close monitoring of sodium levels and careful correction with IV fluids are necessary.

3. Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium levels can lead to confusion, kidney damage, and cardiac problems. Holding calcium supplements and monitoring calcium levels are essential.

4. Leukocytosis: An elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. Blood and urine cultures should be obtained to identify the source of infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered based on the culture results.

5. Hyperkalemia: High potassium levels can be dangerous for the heart and kidneys"

   1. Patent TIPS catheter with wall-to-wall flow.
   2. No intra-abdominal fluid.
   3. Unchanged liver echotexture consistent with history of cirrhosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors. WBC is elevated, concerning for possible
   underlying infection. No ascites to tap per ultrasound report. Worsened
   hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a concern given recent
   hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible precipitant of
   encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest meningitis. She is on
   multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone and neurontin, which
   may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS bleeding and seizure
   seems unlikely. MI also less likely.
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - hold oxycodone and neurontin
   - place NGT
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - urine and blood tox screens
   - will HOLD on LP for now given multiple other possible explanations
   for somnolence that are more likely for her
   - hold on ABG as MS improving
   .
   * Hyponatremia
   Na corrected rapidly post 2L of saline in ER yesterday, remained stable
   overnight
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for now
   .
   * Tachycardia
   Telemetry c/w sinus tach. Probably multifactorial with dehydration, and
   now also low grade temps. Consider whether opiate withdrawal could be
   contributing.
   - IVF plan as above, acetaminophen<2g/day okay for fever, continue to
   follow with infectious workup as below
   * Leukocytosis
   Suggests possible infection. CXR without evidence of pna. Could be
   atypical pna, may also mask infiltrate in setting of dehydration. Broad
   DDX including UTI, C diff given recent hospitalization. UA without any
   pyuria to suggest UTI. Absence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound
   making SBP less likely
   - Blood and urine cultures, urine legionella, CIS. sputum if making any
   - Follow CBC
   - vanc/zosyn/cipro empirically pending cultures for possible HCAP
   .
   * Hyperkalemia
   Improved today
   [**Month (only) 51**] be exacerbated by resuming both spironolactone and bactrim at
   recent discharge. EKG with peaked T's
   - Kayexalate
   - glucose/insulin, bicarb. holding on calcium given hyper Ca
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Follow K daily
   .
   * Hypercalcemia
   Patient was hypercalcemic at last admit, with improvement with holding
   calcium supplements per DC summary. PTH appropriately down at 13. Has
   been evaluated in endocrinology clinic and thought to be [**1-8**] high doses
   of calcitriol.
   - Holding calcium/D
   - IVF as above, follow
   .
   * Dilated bowel on CXR
   KUB c/w  ileus may be due to hypomagnesemia. Soft abdomen and nl
   lactate reassuring.
   - Replete Mag
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Follow stool output
   .
   * Wrist pain
   Question of wrist fracture on plain films. Pt with known osteoporosis.
   - Place in splint, discuss with ortho in AM
   .
   * Cirrhosis
   MELD 16 today.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - Trend LFTs, INR

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She has been hospitalized recently for hepatic encephalopathy and returns with altered mental status, which has now improved. The patient is profoundly hyponatremic but has returned to baseline mental status. 

24-hour events include improving mental status and sodium levels. Allergies are documented, including shellfish, rash from Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine Hcl), hepatic toxicity, tricyclic compounds, and unknown allergies. The patient has received multiple antibiotics over the past 24 hours.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the improvement in mental status. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/70 to 141/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an adequate fluid balance.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal findings in the cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic assessments. The patient has mild abdominal distention and tenderness. Extremities show trace edema. Skin is warm with no jaundice. 

Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and altered liver function tests. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She was recently hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy and is now admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient's sodium levels were profoundly low but have improved to baseline. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/70 to 141/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert, oriented, and moving all extremities. Fluid balance shows a positive input of 1,647 mL and output of 1,350 mL, resulting in a balance of 297 mL. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's altered mental status is now improved and likely due to dehydration and hyponatremia with some component of hepatic encephalopathy. The plan includes IV fluid administration for treatment of sodium and calcium levels, as well as underlying dehydration. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered, and the nasogastric tube may be discontinued if the patient is tolerating oral intake. Rifaximin and lactulose will be continued for hepatic encephalopathy management. A low dose of oxycodone is prescribed for pain.

The patient has hyponatremia that is slowly correcting with re"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors. WBC is elevated, concerning for possible
   underlying infection. No ascites to tap per ultrasound report. Worsened
   hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a concern given recent
   hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible precipitant of
   encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest meningitis. She is on
   multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone and neurontin, which
   may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS bleeding and seizure
   seems unlikely. MI also less likely.
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - hold oxycodone and neurontin
   - place NGT
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - urine and blood tox screens
   - will HOLD on LP for now given multiple other possible explanations
   for somnolence that are more likely for her
   - hold on ABG as MS improving
   .
   * Hyponatremia
   Na corrected rapidly post 2L of saline in ER yesterday, remained stable
   overnight
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for now
   .
   * Tachycardia
   Telemetry c/w sinus tach. Probably multifactorial with dehydration, and
   now also low grade temps. Consider whether opiate withdrawal could be
   contributing.
   - IVF plan as above, acetaminophen<2g/day okay for fever, continue to
   follow with infectious workup as below
   * Leukocytosis
   Suggests possible infection. CXR without evidence of pna. Could be
   atypical pna, may also mask infiltrate in setting of dehydration. Broad
   DDX including UTI, C diff given recent hospitalization. UA without any
   pyuria to suggest UTI. Absence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound
   making SBP less likely
   - Blood and urine cultures, urine legionella, CIS. sputum if making any
   - Follow CBC
   - vanc/zosyn/cipro empirically pending cultures for possible HCAP
   .
   * Hyperkalemia
   Improved today
   [**Month (only) 51**] be exacerbated by resuming both spironolactone and bactrim at
   recent discharge. EKG with peaked T's
   - Kayexalate
   - glucose/insulin, bicarb. holding on calcium given hyper Ca
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Follow K daily
   .
   * Hypercalcemia
   Patient was hypercalcemic at last admit, with improvement with holding
   calcium supplements per DC summary. PTH appropriately down at 13. Has
   been evaluated in endocrinology clinic and thought to be [**1-8**] high doses
   of calcitriol.
   - Holding calcium/D
   - IVF as above, follow
   .
   * Dilated bowel on CXR
   KUB c/w  ileus may be due to hypomagnesemia. Soft abdomen and nl
   lactate reassuring.
   - Replete Mag
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Follow stool output
   .
   * Wrist pain
   Question of wrist fracture on plain films. Pt with known osteoporosis.
   - Place in splint, discuss with ortho in AM
   .
   * Cirrhosis
   MELD 16 today.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - Trend LFTs, INR
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Plts stable, follow

   * DM
   Cover with insulin sliding scale

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She was recently hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy and is now presenting with altered mental status and profound hyponatremia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy worsening: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and recent hospitalization, there is a concern for worsening hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an underlying infection. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered to investigate further.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypercalcemia. These imbalances need to be corrected carefully, with close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although there is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding on the physical examination or ultrasound, it remains a concern due to the patient's advanced liver disease.
5. Meningitis: As the patient has altered mental status, meningitis is also a possibility, although no findings on the examination suggest this diagnosis.
6. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status could potentially be due to a seizure, but there is no evidence of CNS bleeding.
7. Myocardial infarction: While less likely, myocardial infarction should be considered, especially given the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She was recently hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy and returns with altered mental status and profound hyponatremia. Her electrolyte disturbances include low sodium, high calcium, and hypomagnesemia. The patient also has leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and dilated bowel on CXR. She has a history of osteoporosis but no fracture was found. The patient is also diabetic and has a history of chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are significantly low, which can lead to severe neurological symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications if not corrected promptly.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy recurrence, which can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.

3. Possible aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory symptoms may increase the risk of aspiration, leading to pneumonia.

4. Hypercalcemia: Although the patient's calcium levels have improved, there is still a risk of complications associated with high calcium levels, such as kidney stones or decreased kidney function.

5. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's low magnesium levels can affect muscle function and may contribute to neu"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She was recently hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy and is now presenting with altered mental status. The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia. Other lab results show elevated potassium and calcium levels, as well as leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and dilated bowel on chest X-ray. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions to address these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics and shows signs of leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. There is also a concern for aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's altered mental status.
2. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hyponatremia (low sodium), hyperkalemia (high potassium), and hypercalcemia (high calcium). These imbalances need to be closely monitored and managed to avoid complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has liver cirrhosis with a MELD score of 16, indicating severe liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and liver failure.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The"
