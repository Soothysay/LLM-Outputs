   Respiratory distress and oxygenation improved. Patient appears volume
   depleted with marked increase in BUN/Creat ratio over the past several
   days. In addition creatinine has risen and metabolic acidosis worsened.
   I suspect patient has diastolic dysfuntion (exam suggests significant
   aortic stenosis, and old echo consistent with dx of diastolic
   dysfunction), but would not diurese further today; maintain even fluid
   balance. Continue antibiotics for probable pneumonia. Mucus plug may
   have contributed to hypoxemia.
   Hct stable. No need for transfusion now.
   Troponins elevated. Suspect demand ischemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include hypoxemia, congestive heart failure (CHF), aspiration pneumonia, altered mental status, and chronic renal failure (CRF). The patient's oxygenation has improved, but they still require supplemental oxygen. Their mental status has also improved.

The patient's medical history includes gastrointestinal bleed, peptic ulcer disease, acute myocardial infarction, history of stroke (cerebral infarction), coronary artery disease, benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary tract infection, dementia, chronic CHF (diastolic), anemia, pneumonia, and respiratory distress.

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress, with an elevated pulse rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient has a systolic murmur throughout the precordium, delayed and diminished carotid upstroke, symmetric chest expansion, crackles with rare rale in the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and mildly confused neurologic status.

The laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine, troponin-T, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated blood glucose levels. The imaging shows a large heart, prominent vascular markings, fullness of perihilar regions, and probable"

The patient was transferred to the ICU for management of hypoxia in the setting of aspiration event and pulmonary edema after initial admission for UTI and MS changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxia, which is worsening in the setting of pulmonary edema and aspiration event. The ABG shows a pH of 7.42, indicating a normal acid-base balance, but there may be respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation. The patient requires supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 5.2, indicating acute renal failure. Diuretics (Lasix) are being used to manage fluid overload, but it is challenging due to the patient's acute on chronic renal failure.

3. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of CAD, and there are EKG changes suggestive of demand ischemia. Cardiology does not believe there is an acute cardiac event. The patient is currently on beta-blockers, aspirin, and statin therapy. ACE inhibitors are held due to renal failure.

4. Urinary Tract Infection"

   flattened out.
   - Echo with Systolic dysfunction (EF 30-35%) and severe AS.
   - Patient became acutely SOB in PM, tachycardic and tachypnic with
   pressures in the high 80/40.  CXR did not show flash edema, ECG showed
   slightly worse ST elev in V1-V2 and ST depresssions in V4-V6.  Cards

   - Put on non-invasive ventilation for respiratory distress.  He
   tolerated it just long enough that his sats and tachypnea improved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical problems who was transferred to the ICU for management of hypoxia due to aspiration and pulmonary edema after being admitted for UTI and MS changes. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, myocardial infarction, dementia, coronary artery disease, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary tract infection, and depression. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia - the patient is experiencing respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia, which requires close monitoring and supplemental oxygen as needed.
2. Acute Renal Failure - the patient's baseline creatinine is likely 3.8, and it is currently elevated at 4.2 in the setting of diuresis. Further evaluation and management are needed, including holding diuresis for now, obtaining urine analysis, urine culture, and renal consult.
3. Urinary Tract Infection - the patient has a history of UTI, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started. It is important to follow up with urine culture and consider changing antibiotics based on the results.
4. Mental Status Changes - the patient has evidence of dementia but not delirium. Infections should be treated, and family should be contacted in the morning regarding the patient's baseline mental status.
5. EKG Changes - the patient has a history of CAD, and cardiac enzymes should be monitored. An echocardiogram and heparin IV for 24"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Echo showed decreased LV function yesterday with worsening Aortic
   stenosis compared to previous echo; mitral regurg also noted. Last
   night patient became more dyspneic and was started on lasix infusion as
   well as IV heparin. Tried briefly on BiPAP, but didn't tolerate it
   well. Restarted this AM. Oxygenation remains marginal.
   Afebrile. Continues on antibiotics.
   Imdur and Amlodipine stopped yesterday.

   CHF- diastolic chronic
   CHF - systolic, acute
   Patient's status worse over the past 24 hours. Now has systolic
   dysfunction by echo and the murmur is down significantly from yesterday
   suggesting that the patient's cardiac output is reduced. Concern that
   he is having acute ischemia; the worsening on CXR yesterday at a time
   that patient's fluid balance was near even suggests that total body
   volume overload is not the explanation for the acute change in status.
   It is not clear to me that we can really salvage the situation short of
   a valve replacement or valvuloplasty. Development of systolic CHF from
   aortic stenosis carries very high prognosis. Patient now on lasix
   infusion. Difficult to assess urine output with continuous bladder
   irrigation. Urine clear now; will try to stop the irrigation.
   Renal function continues to worsen. Concern about dropping cardiac
   output. Beginning to develop a worsening anion gap; last lactate okay.
   Gap likely represents renal failure.
   I am loathe to intubate him until we resolve the quetions surrounding
   his valve; not clear we would be able to get him off the ventilator.
   With that prognosis, the family may not want patient to be intubated.
   Hct stable. No need for transfusion now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxemia, indicating difficulty in breathing and low oxygen levels in the blood.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed acute respiratory failure, which means their lungs are not adequately providing oxygen to the body.

3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has worsening aortic stenosis, which is a narrowing of the aortic valve. This can lead to reduced blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body.

4. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient also has mitral regurgitation, which is the leakage of blood backward through the mitral valve from the left ventricle to the left atrium.

5. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, indicating long-term kidney dysfunction.

6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can cause significant blood loss and may require intervention.

7. Peptic Ulcer Disease: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease, which involves sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum.

8. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack.

9. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke, which occurs when blood flow to the brain"
