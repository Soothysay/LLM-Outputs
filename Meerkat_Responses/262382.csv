 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal
   varices, currently on liver transplant list presenting with upper GI
   bleed in setting of recent MVC, intubated for acute mental status
   changes.
   #  UPPER GI BLEED:  Currently hemodynamically stable.  HCT at OSH was
   34.  Positive NG Lavage at OSH, no coffee grounds here.  Hepatology
   following. Pt will need EGD in AM, sooner if decompensates. Given
   history of varices, this would be most likely cause. Patient however
   had patent TIPS on [**2190-10-6**] which should significantly decrease the
   risk of variceal bleed. In addition to TIPS stenosis would also
   consider peptic ulcer disease, portal gastropathy, etc.
   - Plan for EGD today v. later
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold octreotide per GI
   - CTX for SBP ppx given UGI bleed
   - Cross matched
   - q6h Hct
   - Liver ultrasound with doppler to assess for TIPS patency
   - hold coumadin
   - hold propranolol
   .
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: As suggested by past presentations, this is
   most likely hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by UGI bleed.  Expect
   worsening after TIPS.  No s/sxs of infection.  Negative U/A.  CXR
   without sig. infiltrate.  No ascites to tap.  LP negative for
   meningitis.  CT head negative for acute pathology.
   - assess mental status function off propofol
   - Lactulose, titrate to 6 BM
   - Restarted rifaximin
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #  RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated given worsening confusion /
   agitation. No intrinsic ventilatory defect, anticipate extubation will
   be determined by mental status.
   - Minimize opiates / benzos for sedation given worsening hepatic
   function
   - Maintain on minimal support as tolerated
   - SBP if mental status cleared
   .
   # Cirrhosis:
   - cont. lactulose, rifaxamin
   - CTX for SBP ppx
   - Liver following, appreciate recs

   Disposition:  ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and esophageal varices, who is currently on the liver transplant list. He presented with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of a recent motor vehicle collision (MVC) and is intubated for acute mental status changes.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of esophageal varices, which is a common cause of upper GI bleed in cirrhotic patients. He is currently hemodynamically stable but requires an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to confirm the diagnosis and determine the source of bleeding.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's acute mental status changes may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of liver cirrhosis. This condition can be precipitated by factors such as upper GI bleed.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to worsening confusion and agitation. He has no intrinsic ventilatory defect, and his extubation will be determined by his mental status.

4. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has a baseline creatinine level indicating chronic renal insufficiency.

5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient is on a reduced dose of insulin and risperidone for diabetes management.

6. Hypertension: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. He presents with altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding after a motor vehicle accident. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 153/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is positive for dry mouth and the presence of an OG/NG tube. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. The abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. The patient's neurologic examination shows sedation with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3. The patient's imaging studies, including a head CT scan and chest X-ray, are negative for any significant abnormalities. The patient's current medications include propofol, pantoprazole, lactulose, rifaximin, and porfifol. The patient's plan includes continued monitoring and management of his altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver function. The goal is to extubate the patient today, pending improvement in his mental status.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. He has esophageal varices that were previously treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. The patient presented with delta MS (likely referring to delirium, agitation, or altered mental status) after a recent motor vehicle accident (MVA). He was intubated at OSH for airway protection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/64 mmHg to 153/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for the recent MVA.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is sedated and not assessed for movement or tone.

Laboratory results show a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.1 K/uL, low platelet count (Plt) of 54, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.8 mg/dL, normal glucose level of 107 mg/dL, and other labs within normal ranges. Imaging and microbiology studies are negative.

The patient's assessment includes HCV cirrhosis, presentation with delta MS likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, intubation for airway protection, and mechanical ventilation. The plan includes continuing rifaximin and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, considering antipsychotics prior to extubation for agitation, and monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient is critically ill and will continue to be managed in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and left portal vein thrombosis. He is currently admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and required intubation for airway protection due to his encephalopathy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 54-73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/76 mmHg to 159/100 mmHg, respiratory rate between 8-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging reveals a patent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with increased flow velocities and occlusion of the left portal vein. Microbiology tests show no growth in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) gram stain and fluid culture results are pending.

The patient's current plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, restarting propranolol after extubation, and holding octreotide and coumadin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and left portal vein thrombosis. He is currently admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of recent motor vehicle collision (MVC), intubated for airway protection due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is on the transplant list.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB - The patient has a history of esophageal varices, which are a common source of UGIB in patients with portal hypertension. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with no evidence of further bleeding, but close monitoring is required.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy - The patient is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, altered mental status, and coma. Sedation should be weaned for a trial of extubation, and lactulose and rifaximin should be continued.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency - The patient has a baseline creatinine level indicating chronic renal insufficiency. Appropriate renal dosing adjustments should be made for medications requiring renal clearance.
4. Diabetes mellitus - The patient's diabetes should be managed with half the usual dose of home insulin (Lantus) and RISS.
5. Hypertension - The patient's hypertension should be managed without propranolol for now.
6. Portal vein thrombosis -"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis and previous esophageal varices bleeding who presented with acute mental status changes. He was initially intubated for airway protection and diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was extubated this morning and is currently doing well without evidence of active bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 122/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent. He is on propofol infusion and pantoprazole (Protonix). 

His physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric breath sounds with crackles at the left base, soft non-tender abdomen, and no peripheral edema. Neurologically, he is attentive, follows simple commands, and is oriented to the hospital. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, platelet count of 54 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, and sodium of 123 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's plan includes continuing aggressive treatment for hepatic encephalopathy and discussing the use of propranolol with the liver specialist. ICU care includes advancing nutrition as tolerated, maintaining glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and providing prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient has a full code status and will remain in the ICU."
