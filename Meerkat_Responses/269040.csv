   This is a 74 y.o. Male with h.o. hypothyroidism p/w septic shock,
   NSTEMI, hypothermia with suspected pulmonary versus urine source.
   .
   ##. Septic Shock: Pt noted to be in septic shock on admission to the
   ED. Found to have pna and equivocal urinalysis. Per family pt has a
   history of PNA versus aspiration PNA, hospitalizaed three times over
   the past year
   - influenza antigen and legionella negative
   - weaning pressors, now just on levophed
   - will continue on broad coverage with Zosyn, Cipro for coverage of
   Gram+, Gram -, atypicals and double coverage for Pseudomonas.
   Vancomycin for MRSA. Blood cx from OSH growing GPCs in clusters. Will
   wait to confirm that this is not contaminant before narrowing coverage
   - f/u panculture results, continue surveillance blood cultures
   - will continue on IV Hydrocortisone, wean starting tomorrow
   - pt on xygris [**1-20**] high apache score, check [**Hospital1 **] coags
   .
   .
   ##. Respiratory Failure: Pt currently on ARDSnet protocol, however
   overall status seems to be improved
   - continue ardsnet
   - will aim to wean today possibly try PSV
   - lighten Fentanyl and Midazolam
   .
   #hyperkalemia: could be [**1-20**] to renal failure, but pt is making urine.
   Also ? hypoaldo as [**Last Name (un) **] pmh and [**Last Name (un) **] home meds. Most likely [**1-20**] to comb
   of renal insuff plus repletion c LR. Will call PCP today Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8406**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8407**] today to get better sense of pmh.
   -f/u am K
   -may need additional kayexelate, but will hold for now
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  [**Last Name (un) **] baseline.
   -Consider urine sediment.
   -Check urine lytes to diff bet prerenal v atn, most likely atn
   -ask pcp about baseline GFR
   .
   ##. MI: Pt showed no ischemic EKG changes in the ED but cardiac enzymes
   were noted to be positive with a CK of 1836, CKMB 230, CKMBI 12.5,
   Troponin 0.06. TWI in I, avL, q in Lead III, small R-wave and aVF
   inferiorly. Pt ruled in, likely ischemic from his prolonged episode of
   hypotension. Pt currently on Xigris so would not give IV Heparin due to
   bleeding risk, pt also not a candidate for cath given his instability.
   - consider add bblocker and ace if improves clinically and off pressors
   and asa once xygris off
   .
   ##. Bradycardic: Pt noted to be bradycardic, requiring Atropine in the
   field for HR in the 40s. Bradycardia is likely due to his hypothermia.
   - will continue to monitor heart rate on tele, not bradycardic since
   admission
   .
   # Anemia: pt
s crit trending down throughout admission. Likely [**1-20**]
   aggressive fluid hydration
   -keep active type and screen
   -increase H2B to [**Hospital1 **]
   -guiac stool
   .
   ##. Hypothyroidism: Will continue on home regimen of levothyroxine.
   .
   #housekeeping: will call PCP to learn more about overall status of pt
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, consider OGT and tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin , bowel reg

   Pt is currently is hypothermic on examination. Pt noted to have
   positive U/A as well as large PNA on left lung. Suspect sources to be
   pulmonary versus urine. Pt's CVP currently [**10-30**], MAP noted to be 76,
   with a mixed venous sat of 83%. Pt also was reportedly on Dexamethasone
   at home and thus was given stress dose steroids in the ED. Per family
   pt has a history of PNA versus aspiration PNA, hospitalizaed three
   times over the past year
   - influenza antigen and legionella negative
   - will try to wean DA first and then levophed to maintain MAP >65
   - will continue on broad coverage with Zosyn, Cipro for coverage of
   Gram+, Gram -, atypicals and double coverage for Pseudomonas.
   Vancomycin for MRSA. Blood cx from OSH growing GPCs in clusters

   were noted to be positive with a CK of 1836, CKMB 230, CKMBI 12.5,
   Troponin 0.06. TWI in I, avL, q in Lead III, small R-wave and aVF
   inferiorly. Pt ruled in, likely ischemic from his prolonged episode of
   hypotension. Pt currently on Xigris so would not give IV Heparin due to
   bleeding risk, pt also not a candidate for cath given his instability.
   - consider add bblocker and ace if improves clinically and off pressors
   and asa once xygris off

   ##. Bradycardic: Pt noted to be bradycardic, requiring Atropine in the
   field for HR in the 40s. Bradycardia is likely due to his hypothermia.
   - will continue to monitor heart rate on tele, not bradycardic since
   admission

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source. The patient has been in septic shock since admission to the ED and was transferred to the ICU on three pressors. The patient's condition has been unstable with hypothermia, positive urine analysis, and large pneumonia on the left lung. The source of infection is suspected to be either pulmonary or urinary. The patient's CVP is low, MAP is 76, and mixed venous saturation is 83%. The patient has been given stress dose steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics including Zosyn, Cipro, and Vancomycin for MRSA coverage. Blood cultures are pending. The patient is also on IV Hydrocortisone and Xigris.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization and poor perfusion.
2. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, which could be due to lactic acidosis secondary to poor tissue perfusion.
3. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic: The patient is in septic shock, indicating poor tissue perfusion and possible hypovolemia.
4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is currently on ARDSnet protocol and requires mechanical ventilation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source. He was admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple pressors, sedated, intubated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has impaired skin integrity, metabolic acidosis, mixed acidosis, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), septic shock, acute renal failure, and hypokalemia. He also has a history of pneumonia and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased perfusion.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a mixed acidosis, which can lead to various complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction.
3. Hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and high heart rate indicate possible ongoing hypovolemia or hemorrhage, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to multiorgan failure.
4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, including the development of ARDS.
5. Septic shock: The patient is already in septic shock, and if not appropriately managed, it"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary or urinary source. The patient is currently in the ICU, on mechanical ventilation, and receiving multiple pressors. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
2. Acidosis, metabolic and mixed: The patient has an elevated lactate level and low bicarbonate level, indicating possible metabolic acidosis. Mixed acidosis can occur due to various underlying conditions.
3. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic: The patient's low blood pressure and high central venous pressure suggest a possible hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock.
4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is on ARDSnet protocol and requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. Acute respiratory failure may be present due to pneumonia or other lung pathology.
5. Septic shock: The patient's presentation with sepsis and septic shock indicates a severe infection that requires prompt treatment.
6. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen levels suggest acute renal failure, possibly due to hypoperfusion or sepsis.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed appropriately to improve the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source infection. The patient has been hospitalized multiple times in the past year for pneumonia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn, Cipro, and vancomycin). Cultures have grown VRE sensitive to ampicillin, as well as coag-negative staph from blood (likely contaminant) and enterococcus from urine.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and possible sick sinus syndrome. Other medical conditions include schizophrenia, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. The patient's home situation is concerning, with poor living conditions and a sister who is debilitated by psych issues.

Plan:

1. Septic Shock: Continue on broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any changes in condition. Follow up with panculture results and surveillance blood cultures.
2. Respiratory Failure: Continue ARDSnet protocol and aim to wean today, possibly try PSV. Lighten Fentanyl and Midazolam sedation.
3. Bradycardia: Consider cardiology consult for possible sick sinus syndrome. Monitor heart rate closely.
4. Anemia: Keep active type and screen, increase H2B to [Hospital1], and perform guiac stool test.
5. Hypothyroidism: Increase le"

   ##. Septic Shock: Pt noted to be in septic shock on admission to the
   ED. Found to have pna and equivocal urinalysis. Per family pt has a
   history of PNA versus aspiration PNA, hospitalizaed three times over
   the past year
   - influenza antigen and legionella negative
   - weaning pressors, now just on levophed
   - will continue on broad coverage with Zosyn, Cipro and vancomycin.
   currently growing vre sensitive to amp, gnrs from sputum and coag neg
   staph from blood (likely contaminant). Likely dc vancomycin tomorrow
   - f/u panculture results
   - will continue on IV Hydrocortisone, weaned to 50q6h (=7.5 daily of
   decadron, pt on 2 daily of decadron at home)
   - pt on xygris [**1-20**] high apache score, check [**Hospital1 **] coags. Will dc xygris
   today if PTT stays high this afternoon.
   .
   ##. Respiratory Failure: Pt currently on ARDSnet protocol, however
   overall status seems to be improved
   - will aim to wean today possibly try PSV
   - lighten Fentanyl and Midazolam
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  baseline 1.8-2, current Cr is 4. Likely this is [**1-20**] ATN. UOP
   has gone from low to high so likely renal function is in process of
   improving.
   -will trend

   ##. MI: Pt showed no ischemic EKG changes in the ED but cardiac enzymes
   were noted to be positive with a CK of 1836, CKMB 230, CKMBI 12.5,
   Troponin 0.06. TWI in I, avL, q in Lead III, small R-wave and aVF
   inferiorly. Pt ruled in, likely ischemic from his prolonged episode of
   hypotension. Pt currently on Xigris so would not give IV Heparin due to
   bleeding risk, pt also not a candidate for cath given his instability.
   - consider add bblocker and ace if improves clinically and off pressors
   and asa once xygris off
   .
   ##. Bradycardic: Pt noted to be bradycardic, requiring atropine in the
   field for HR in the 40s. Bradycardia initially thought to likely be due
   to his hypothermia. However, had additional episode of sinus brady last
   night
   -consider cards consult when pt clinically improved for ? sick sinus
   syndrome if pt has recurrent bradycardia
   - will continue to monitor heart rate on tele
   .
   # Anemia: pt
s crit trending down throughout admission. Likely [**1-20**]
   aggressive fluid hydration. Pt does also have h/o peptic ulcers.
   -keep active type and screen
   -increase H2B to [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, pneumonia, schizophrenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, and adrenal insufficiency. He presented with septic shock, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypothermia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic response to infection. It is important to monitor his vital signs, fluid status, and organ function closely.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging, and close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has signs of acute kidney injury, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
4. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has evidence of myocardial infarction, as indicated by positive cardiac enzymes. Monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia and considering anti-ischemic medications and cardiac rehabilitation is important.
5. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, which"

   inferiorly. Pt ruled in, likely ischemic from his prolonged episode of
   hypotension. Pt currently on Xigris so would not give IV Heparin due to
   bleeding risk, pt also not a candidate for cath given his instability.
   - consider add bblocker and ace if improves clinically and off pressors
   and asa once xygris off
   .
   ##. Bradycardia: Pt noted to be bradycardic, requiring atropine in the
   field for HR in the 40s. Bradycardia initially thought to likely be due
   to his hypothermia. However, had additional episode of sinus brady last
   night
   -consider cards consult when pt clinically improved for ? sick sinus
   syndrome if pt has recurrent bradycardia
   - will continue to monitor heart rate on tele

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source infection. He has been hospitalized three times over the past year for pneumonia, once due to aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. He has been weaned off vancomycin and is now on Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 120/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,792 mL and output of 1,890 mL since midnight. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods in the sputum and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in the urine. He has positive cardiac enzymes with elevated CK, CK-MB, and Troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial injury. The patient also has metabolic acidosis and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock suggests a severe systemic infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, pneumonia, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary or urinary source. He is currently in the ICU and has been admitted multiple times over the past year for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient was noted to be in septic shock upon admission, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection leading to widespread inflammation and organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ARDSnet protocol, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome. This can lead to severe difficulty in breathing and may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.8-2 has increased to 4.5, suggesting potential kidney damage, possibly due to sepsis or other factors.
4. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient showed positive cardiac enzymes with elevated CK, CKMB, and Troponin levels, indicating myocardial injury. This could be related to prolonged hypotension.
5. Bradycardia: The patient experienced episodes of bradycardia, requiring atropine administration. This could be due to hypothermia or sick sinus syndrome.
6. Anemia: The patient's critical trending down throughout admission, indicating a decrease in red blood cell count. This may be related to aggressive fluid hydration or underlying conditions"

   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  baseline 1.8-2, current Cr is 4.2 down from 4.5 yesterday.
   Likely this is [**1-20**] ATN. UOP has gone from low to high so perhaps renal
   function is in process of improving.
   -will trend
   -no acute indications for HD at this point
   -pt is on lasix at home, could consider giving lasix gtt once off
   pressors

   were noted to be positive with a CK of 1836, CKMB 230, CKMBI 12.5,
   troponin 0.06. TWI in I, avL, q in Lead III, small R-wave and aVF
   inferiorly. Pt ruled in, likely ischemic from his prolonged episode of
   hypotension.
   - consider add bblocker and ace if improves clinically and off pressors
   -consider starting ASA now that xigris is off
   .
   ##. Bradycardia: Pt noted to be bradycardic, requiring atropine in the
   field for HR in the 40s. Bradycardia initially thought to likely be due
   to his hypothermia. However, had additional episode of sinus brady 2

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Septic Shock: The patient was initially in septic shock upon admission to the ED and has a history of pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. There is ongoing concern for potential sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of GNRs (gram-negative rods) in the sputum and VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) in the urine. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and the patient's response to treatment will be monitored.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to the underlying sepsis. The goal is to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation and transition to spontaneous breathing. However, previous attempts to wean have been unsuccessful.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.8-2, and it has increased to 4.2, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This could be related to the hypotension and prolonged episode of shock. Renal function is expected to improve as the patient recovers.

4. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating a myocardial infarction. Although there were no ischemic EKG changes, the presence of positive cardiac markers suggests ischemia, likely resulting from prolonged hypotension.

5. Bradycard"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source. The patient has been hospitalized three times over the past year for pneumonia. Initial lab results show positive GNRs in sputum, VRE in urine, and coag-negative staph from blood (likely contaminant). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn and Cipro) and has completed courses of vancomycin and Xigris. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/55-142/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,410 mL and output of 2,025 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving IV fluids, including 1,327 mL of normal saline and 1,083 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. 

Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 860 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with respiratory failure, septic shock, NSTEMI, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has shown substantial progress.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating ongoing respiratory support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of endotracheal intubation. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening respiratory failure or development of VAP.

2. Septic shock: Although the patient is off pressors, there is still a risk of recurrent septic shock due to underlying infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, is essential to detect any signs of hemodynamic instability.

3. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). There is a risk of further cardiac complications such as recurrent myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias. Monitoring of the patient's cardiac rhythm and symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath is important.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a low hemoglobin level. This can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygen saturation and symptoms of fatigue or d"

- The patient has been hospitalized three times over the past year for pneumonia, with a history of influenza antigen and Legionella negative.
- The patient's current medications include zosyn, imi, tobra, ASA, and hydrocortisone.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 136/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including schizophrenia, COPD, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus.
- The patient's physical examination reveals altered mental status, obesity, pitting edema, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment, which can worsen due to hypotension, seps"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source infection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a recent trial off the ventilator that was unsuccessful. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple organisms including Acinetobacter baumannii complex, VRE, and MRSA. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 136/58 mmHg to 104/41 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 50% FiO2. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's plan includes weaning off sedation for a spontaneous breathing trial, continuing IV hydrocortisone, and restarting ASA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator will be attempted today.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.8-2, which has increased to 4.6. There are no acute indications for hemodialysis at this point, but the patient's renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism who presented with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary or urinary tract infection. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antibiotics for suspected infections, anticoagulation, and management of hyperglycemia, among others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on respiratory support due to low oxygen saturation levels and bilateral patchy air space opacities seen on chest X-ray. There is a concern for mucus plug in the left lung.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely due to tube feeding and hypotonic diuresis.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, but it is not delirium.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating diabetes mellitus.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to prolonged immobility and pressure from medical devices.
6. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible renal dysfunction.
7. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia, which may be related to hypothermia or sick sinus syndrome.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, likely due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, and hypothermia. He has been admitted multiple times over the past year for pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia. This condition requires immediate medical attention and may require mechanical ventilation support.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and possible dialysis may be necessary.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. This can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
5. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which requires aggressive treatment to stabilize his vital signs and control the source of infection.
6. Acute Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has evidence of an acute myocardial infarction, which requires monitoring and management of cardiac function.
7. Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing bradycardia, which can be a result"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypernatremia, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and a history of pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia.

The patient was admitted to the ICU and received broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage for GNRs in the sputum and VRE in the urine. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has a history of hypotension, hypothermia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function tests.

The plan includes continuing aggressive fluid hydration, increasing free water in tube feeds, monitoring for CBC as the patient is on linezolid, and following up with culture results. The patient is also being weaned off hydrocortisone and restarted on levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, persistent respiratory failure, development of delirium or altered mental status, and potential infections due to indwelling lines and tubes.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further assessment and consultation with healthcare professionals are recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition."

","Summary:
This is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by infection, low blood pressure, and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of Acinetobacter pneumonia and volume overload from fluid resuscitation. Aggressive diuresis is being continued to manage this condition.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic, with a high sodium level. This may be due to tube feeding and hypotonic diuresis in the setting of Lasix gtt. Free water intake in tube feeds is being increased to address this.
4. Bradycardia: The patient is bradycardic and requires atropine for heart rate in the 40s. This may be related to hypothermia or sick sinus syndrome.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly secondary to septic shock and fluid overload. Close monitoring of renal function is essential, and hemodialysis may be required if diuresis does not improve.
6. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has evidence of an MI"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, and hypothermia. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of Acinetobacter pneumonia and volume overload from fluid resuscitation. The patient has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, bradycardia, anemia, hypothyroidism, schizophrenia, COPD, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and potential concerns about his home situation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has not improved, with ongoing bilateral airspace consolidation and atelectasis. There is a need for aggressive diuresis to manage fluid overload.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which could be due to tube feeding and hypotonic diuresis. Free water should be continued in tube feeds to maintain hydration.
3. Hypertension: The patient has systolic hypertension, and antihypertensive medication may be necessary if it continues to remain high.
4. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has positive cardiac enzymes, indicating an ischemic event. Medications such as beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors may be considered pending improvement of bradycardia and renal function, respectively.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently low, and"

   -defer trial of SBP until respiratory status improves
   - continue aggressive diuresis
   - influenza antigen and legionella negative
   # Urinary infection - Pt was growing VRE sensitive to Ampicillin and
   Linezolid.  Started on Linezolid per ID recs given pt was in septic
   shock.
   - His last urine was clean, continue Linezolid for 10 day course.  Day
   1= [**9-14**].
   - Monitor for CBC as pt on linezolid

   yesterday.  Diuresing well.
   -will trend
   -volume overload will likely be indication for  HD, if unable to
   diurese
   -pt is on 40mg lasix PO BID at home; will continue gentle diuresis c
   lasix gtt
   -if renal function does not improve, will consult renal
   #hypernatremia: hypernatremic to 150 yesterday after increasing free
   water boluses through OG to 300  q 4hr.  Likely due to tube feeding and
   hypotonic diuresis in setting of lasix ggt.  He was given a bolus of
   D5W.   Tube feeds were changed from Nutren to Novasource which has less
   sodium.
   - continue free water in tube feeds at 300cc q 4h.
   - q8 sodium checks
   # Anemia: pt

   ##. MI: Pt showed no ischemic EKG changes in the ED but cardiac enzymes
   were noted to be positive with a CK of 1836, CKMB 230, CKMBI 12.5,
   troponin 0.06. TWI in I, avL, q in Lead III, small R-wave and aVF
   inferiorly. Pt ruled in, likely ischemic from his prolonged episode of
   hypotension.
   - Would like to start  BB and ace, pending improvement of bradycardia
   and RF respectively
   - on  ASA now that xigris is off
   - would like to start statin if no contraindication
   # #Schizophrenia: holding clozaril and perphenazine while intubated and
   sedated.
   - wil restart perphenazine when awake at 4 mg [**Hospital1 **], with 2 mg PRN when

   - IM haldol if unable to tolerate PO
   - will not restart clozarin until linezolid course complete
   - SW following, he is OK for rehab upon d/c
   ##. Bradycardia: Pt noted to be bradycardic, requiring atropine in the
   field for HR in the 40s. Bradycardia initially thought to likely be due
   to his hypothermia. However, had additional episode of sinus brady 2
   nights ago
   -consider cards consult when pt clinically improved for ? sick sinus

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, presenting with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source infection. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications including hypernatremia, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient likely has a combination of Acinetobacter pneumonia and volume overload from fluid resuscitation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further sensitivities will be obtained.
2. Urinary Infection: The patient was growing vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) sensitive to ampicillin and linezolid. Linezolid has been started for 10 days.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic due to tube feeding and hypotonic diuresis in the setting of lasix gtt. Free water in tube feeds has been increased to 300cc q4h, and D5W bolus was given.
4. Anemia: The patient has a normocytic anemia with high RDW. Hemolysis labs are negative, and a transfusion of one unit has been ordered.
5. Hypertension: The patient has systolic hypertension in the 170"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 74 yom w/h/o paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism,
   hypoadrenalism p/w septic shock, NSTEMI and hypothermia with initial
   suspected pulmonary vs. urine source.
   ##. Respiratory Failure/PNA:  most recent cultures positive for
   Acinetobacter and MRSA with superimposed pulmonary edema.
   Sensitivities include Tobraicin and Imipneum (Acinetobacter) AND
   Vancomycin, Linezolid (MRSA).  Echo showed severe dysfunction and
   pulmonary edema likely resulted from combination of ATN with fluid
   resuscitation.  Barriers to extubation include underlying infectious
   process and fluid overload
   - continue meropenum (4 of 14) and linezolid  (4 of 14)
 consider
   switching to Vancomycin for reduced r/o thrombocytopenia
   - lasix gtt for aggressive diuresis + 20.9 L  for LOS, - 1 L  overnight
   - attempt to wean vent to [**4-22**] with SBT if tolrates
   - follow up cultures, CXR
   # Hypertension
 patient with continued HTN in 160
s but holding ACE-I
   for RF and BB for bradycardia.  Patient recently started on hydralazine
   10 mg TID with minimal response. Patient continues on Lasix gtt.
   - consider increasing dose of hydralazine for improved BP control
   will consider adding back CCB amlodipine as HR tolerates
   # Urinary infection
 initial urine cultures grew VRE and patient was
   started on Linezolid per ID with most recent urine culture negative.
   - continue Linezolid day [**4-24**]
   - monitor CBC for drug induced thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely resulting from ATN in septic shock state with normal
   baseline 1.8-2, now trending down from peak to 3.6 from peak of 4.6
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue lasix gtt for diuresis with goal of -1.5 L negative per day
   - consider CVVH for fluid overload state considering 20+ L positive as
   this is large barrier to extubation and course may be prolonged if
   diuresis is accomplished through lasix gtt
   #hypernatremia: likely combination of pre-renal azotemia in setting of
   hypertonic tube feeds.
   - continue to monitor and treat with free water flushes and IVF PRN
   # Anemia: patient is s/p 1 unit PRBC
s for gradually dropping HCT,
   responding with appropriate HCT bump.  Patient dose have history of
   PUD; however, negative guiac, normocytic anemia with high RDW and
   negative hemolysis workup
   - continue to monitor with [**Hospital1 **] HCT
s with goal HCT > 25
   #Schizophrenia: holding clozaril and perphenazine while intubated and
   sedated.
   - wil restart perphenazine when awake at 4 mg [**Hospital1 **], with 2 mg PRN when
   agitated (PO).
   - IM haldol if unable to tolerate PO
   - will not restart clozarin until linezolid course complete for risk of
   pancyotopenia
   #. Bradycardia: patient with noted bradycardia requiring atropine in
   the field and episode of sinus bradycardia while in the CCU
   - consider cardiology consult to evaluate for SSS AND hold nodal
   blocking agents
   #. Hypothyroidism: Will continue on home regimen of levothyroxine
   #COPD: continue atrovent and albuterol
   #Adrenal insufficiency: on dexamethasone 2mg at home, will continue to
   wean hydrocort slowly and restart dexamethasone at home dose.
    - continue hydrocortisone 25 mg q 12 today = to home dose of decadron,
   may switch to PO decadrone
   # DM: continue insulin SQ with ISS

   Acinetobacter and MRSA with superimposed pulmonary edema.
   Sensitivities include Tobraicin and Imipneum (Acinetobacter) AND
   Vancomycin, Linezolid (MRSA).  Echo showed severe dysfunction and
   pulmonary edema likely resulted from combination of ATN with fluid
   resuscitation.  Barriers to extubation include underlying infectious
   process and fluid overload
   - continue meropenum (4 of 14) and linezolid  (4 of 14)
 switch to PO
   Linezolid to reduce free water loads
   - lasix gtt for continued diuresis + 20.9 L  for LOS, - 1 L  overnight,

   # Hypertension
 patient with continued HTN in 160
s but holding ACE-I
   for RF and BB for bradycardia.  Patient recently started on hydralazine
   10 mg TID with minimal response. Patient continues on Lasix gtt.
   - consider increasing dose of hydralazine for improved BP control
   will consider adding back CCB amlodipine while avoiding any nodal
   agents as h/o bradycardia
   # Urinary infection
 initial urine cultures grew VRE and patient was
   started on Linezolid per ID with most recent urine culture negative.
   - continue Linezolid day [**4-24**]
   - monitor CBC for drug induced thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely resulting from ATN in septic shock state with normal
   baseline 1.8-2, now trending down from peak to 3.6 from peak of 4.6
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue lasix gtt for diuresis with goal of -1.5 L negative per day
 titrate down gtt while maintain UOP

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, and paranoid schizophrenia. He presented with septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary versus urine source infection. The patient has been in the ICU and has had multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient's recent cultures were positive for Acinetobacter and MRSA, with superimposed pulmonary edema. This indicates a potential respiratory infection that may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Hypertension: The patient continues to have high blood pressure despite being on antihypertensive medication. This could indicate uncontrolled hypertension.
3. Urinary Infection: Although the most recent urine culture is negative, there was an initial growth of VRE. This suggests a previous urinary infection which could potentially recur.
4. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with a high RDW and negative hemolysis workup. This may be indicative of ongoing blood loss or inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to pre-renal azotemia in the setting of hypertonic tube feeds. This condition can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or medications.
7. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and requires insulin therapy. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and other complications.
9. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, as indicated by the accumulation of fluids in the lungs and edema. This can lead to further respiratory distress and cardiovascular issues.

These are some potential medical complications that the patient may face based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism admitted to the ICU for septic shock, NSTEMI, and hypothermia. Initially, there was suspicion of pulmonary vs. urine source of infection. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure/pneumonia, with recent cultures showing Acinetobacter and MRSA, along with pulmonary edema and fluid overload due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and resuscitation. Other medical conditions include hypertension, acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, hypernatremia, anemia, schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, COPD, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and familial hypertriglyceridemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter and MRSA. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, worsening respiratory failure, and increased risk of infections.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient has developed acute tubular necrosis, likely due to septic shock and fluid resuscitation. This condition requires careful management of fluid balance and electrolytes.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, currently controlled with hydralazine"

   This is a 74 yom w/h/o paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism,
   hypoadrenalism p/w septic shock, NSTEMI and hypothermia with initial
   suspected pulmonary vs. urine source.
   ##. Respiratory Failure/PNA:  most recent cultures positive for
   Acinetobacter and MRSA with superimposed pulmonary edema.
   Sensitivities include Tobraicin and Imipneum (Acinetobacter) AND
   Vancomycin, Linezolid (MRSA).  Echo showed severe dysfunction and
   pulmonary edema likely resulted from combination of ATN with fluid
   resuscitation.  Barriers to extubation include underlying infectious
   process and fluid overload
   - continue meropenum (4 of 14) and linezolid  (4 of 14)
 switch to PO
   Linezolid to reduce free water loads
   - lasix gtt for continued diuresis + 20.9 L  for LOS, - 1 L  overnight,
   attempt to titrate down drip as long as UOP remains stable
   - attempt to wean vent to [**4-22**] with SBT if tolrates
   - follow up cultures, CXR
   # Hypertension
 patient with continued HTN in 160
s but holding ACE-I
   for RF and BB for bradycardia.  Patient recently started on hydralazine
   10 mg TID with minimal response. Patient continues on Lasix gtt.
   - consider increasing dose of hydralazine for improved BP control
   will consider adding back CCB amlodipine while avoiding any nodal
   agents as h/o bradycardia
   # Urinary infection
 initial urine cultures grew VRE and patient was
   started on Linezolid per ID with most recent urine culture negative.
   - continue Linezolid day [**4-24**]
   - monitor CBC for drug induced thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely resulting from ATN in septic shock state with normal
   baseline 1.8-2, now trending down from peak to 3.6 from peak of 4.6
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue lasix gtt for diuresis with goal of -1.5 L negative per day
 titrate down gtt while maintain UOP
   #hypernatremia: likely combination of pre-renal azotemia in setting of
   hypertonic tube feeds.
   - continue to monitor and treat with free water flushes and IVF PRN
   # Anemia: patient is s/p 1 unit PRBC
s for gradually dropping HCT,
   responding with appropriate HCT bump.  Patient dose have history of
   PUD; however, negative guiac, normocytic anemia with high RDW and
   negative hemolysis workup likely representing
   - continue to monitor with daily HCT
s with goal HCT > 25
   #Schizophrenia: holding clozaril and perphenazine while intubated and
   sedated.
   -  will not restart clozarin until linezolid course complete for risk
   of pancyotopenia
   #. Bradycardia: patient with noted bradycardia requiring atropine in
   the field and episode of sinus bradycardia while in the CCU
   - consider cardiology consult if continued problems with HR to evaluate
   for SSS AND continue to hold nodal blocking agents
   #. Hypothyroidism: will continue on home regimen of levothyroxine,
   switching to PO to decrease free water
   #COPD: continue atrovent and albuterol
   #Adrenal insufficiency: on dexamethasone 2mg at home, will continue to
   wean hydrocort slowly and restart dexamethasone at home dose.
    - continue hydrocortisone 25 mg q 12 today = to home dose of decadron,

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with suspected pulmonary vs. urine source and diagnosed with septic shock, NSTEMI, and hypothermia. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by PNA with positive cultures for Acinetobacter and MRSA. He also has severe pulmonary edema likely resulting from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with fluid resuscitation. The patient's current medications include meropenem, linezolid, lasix gtt, and diamox. He has been weaned off some of his medications to reduce fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Underlying Infectious Process: The patient has ongoing infections indicated by positive cultures for Acinetobacter and MRSA. This increases the risk of further complications or the development of antibiotic resistance.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload as evidenced by a high fluid intake-output balance. This can lead to congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and renal dysfunction.
3. Hypertension: The patient has persistent hypertension despite being on antihypertensive medications. This may increase the risk of end-organ damage if not adequately controlled.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient initially had a urinary tract infection with VRE, but recent cultures were negative."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism who presented with septic shock due to Staph and Acinetobacter pneumonia, as well as NSTEMI in the setting of sepsis. The patient has been hospitalized and experienced acute-on-chronic renal failure, hypernatremia in the setting of diuresis, and hypertension.

24-hour events include the patient being extubated after invasive ventilation, free water flushes decreased now that sodium is improving, already met goal Is and Os, came down on the lasix, started amlodipine, and talked to the daughter about code status.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

Infusions: Furosemide (Lasix) at 3 mg/hour and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) started on 2121-09-19 at 08:09 PM.

Other medications: Linezolid, Meropenem, and others are documented.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

Physical examination findings include cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, extremity, and neurological assessments.

Lab results show elevated WBC, Hct, and glucose levels, with decreased platelet count. Imaging shows bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. Microbiology reveals negative blood"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He presented with septic shock due to Staph and Acinetobacter pneumonia, as well as NSTEMI. His hospitalization has been complicated by acute-on-chronic renal failure, hypernatremia in the setting of diuresis, and hypertension.

The patient was intubated but is now extubated and breathing comfortably with a face mask. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/43 mmHg to 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,789 mL, including 716 mL through the oral route, 549 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 469 mL through intravenous fluids. The total output consists of 3,720 mL of urine, 650 mL of nasogastric drainage, and 310 mL of TPN output. The patient's weight is currently 111.6 kg, with a decrease from the admission weight of 100 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom w/ paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism a/w
   pneumosepsis vs, urosepsis c/b by NSTEMI and acinetobacter MRSA PNA,
   now extubated but with continued elevated oxygen requirements.
   ##. Respiratory Failure/PNA:  most recent cultures from [**9-14**] showing
   Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia in setting of fluid overload and
   pulmonary edema.
   - continue meropenum (8 of 14) and linezolid  (8 of 14)
   - increase lasix gtt (titrated as low as possible) for continued
   diuresis as patient was positive yesterday + 19 for [**Location 4982**] f/u cultures and CXR
   - continue face mask with down titration as oxygen requirement permits
   # Hypertension
 patient with occasional HTN but has remained in the
   120
s for the past day.  His home dose ACE-I and BB are being held for
   his RF and bradycardia and he is currently being treated with
   hydralazine and amlodipine.
   - continue to up-titrate Amlodipine and down titrate Hydralazine
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely resulting from ATN in septic shock state with normal
   baseline 1.8-2, now trending down from peak to 3.1 from peak of 4.6
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - limit daily fluid intake and continue minimal lasix gtt to achieve -
   1.5L per day
   # Schizophrenia:   will hold clozaril until linezolid course complete
   for risk of pancyotopenia.  On home dose of perphenzine.
   - contact family concerning baseline mental status and interactions
   - consider psychiatry consult
   # Urinary infection
 only urine Cx from [**9-8**] positive for VRE,
   completed 7 day course of Linezolid.  Most recent cultures from [**9-14**]
   negative.
   - continue to follow with periodic surveillance cultures
   # Hypernatremia: likely combination of pre-renal azotemia in setting of
   hypertonic tube feeds.
   - continue to monitor with daily electrolytes and titrate free water
   flushes in tube feeds PRN
   # Anemia: continued slow drop of HCT from 28 to 26.2 to 25.8 in the
   setting of known PUD
   - re-guiac stool to r/o slow GIB
   - avoid transfusion if possible to avoid contributing to volume
   overload
 threshold is 23
   #.Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # COPD: continue atrovent and albuterol

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism who is currently in the ICU for pneumosepsis vs urosepsis. The patient has sputum cultures positive for MRSA and acinetobacter. He continues to require high oxygen levels and has thick secretions. The patient's weight has increased from 100 kg at admission to 107.3 kg currently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter and MRSA. The continued elevated oxygen requirements indicate ongoing respiratory failure. The patient should continue receiving meropenem and linezolid, and lasix gtt should be increased for diuresis.

2. Hypertension: The patient has occasional hypertension, which is currently being managed with hydralazine and amlodipine. The dose of amlodipine should be up-titrated, and the dose of hydralazine should be down-titrated.

3. Renal Failure/ATN: The patient's creatinine level is trending down from a peak of 4.6, indicating possible improvement from acute tubular necrosis (ATN). However, the patient's current creatinine level is still elevated at 3.1. The patient's urine output should be monitored, and fluid intake should be limited to achieve a daily output of - 1."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was initially admitted with suspected pneumonia versus urosepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient's sputum cultures are positive for MRSA and Acinetobacter. He continues to have thick secretions and requires a high amount of oxygen.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 10 mg/hour, meropenem antibiotics, and linezolid. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/50 mmHg to 153/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an ongoing infection. Other lab results, such as hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), blood glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes, are within normal limits or show minimal abnormalities.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure/pneumonia, hypertension, acute kidney injury (AKI), schizophrenia, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypernatremia, anemia, hypothyroidism,"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom w/ paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism p/w
   septic shock, NSTEMI and hypothermia with initial suspected pulmonary
   vs. urine source.
   ##. Respiratory Failure/PNA:  most recent positive cultures from [**9-14**]
   show Acinetobacter and MRSA with superimposed pulmonary edema and fluid
   overload which likely resulted from a combination of ATN and
   resuscitation.  Barriers to extubation include underlying infectious
   process, fluid overload, body habitus, muscle weakness.  Patient had a
   SBT yesterday with RSBI of 28.
   - continue meropenum (7 of 14) and linezolid  (7 of 14)
   - continue lasix gtt (titrated as low as possible) for continued
   diuresis + 18.5L for [**Location 4982**] f/u cultures and CXR
   - extubated
   # Hypertension
 patient with occasional HTN but has remained in the
   120
s for the past day.  His home dose ACE-I and BB are being held for
   his RF and bradycardia and he is currently being treated with
   hydralazine 10mg PO TID.
   - add Amlodipine 5 mg today and wean down PO hydralazine
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely resulting from ATN in septic shock state with normal
   baseline 1.8-2, now trending down from peak to 3.2 from peak of 4.6
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue minimal lasix gtt to achieve - 1.5L per day
   # Schizophrenia:   will hold clozaril until linezolid course complete
   for risk of pancyotopenia.  On home dose of perphenzine.  Hasn
   required prn doses, no agitation.
   # Urinary infection
 only urine Cx from [**9-8**] positive for VRE
   - continue Linezolid day [**6-24**]
   - monitor CBC for drug induced thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia
   # Hypernatremia: likely combination of pre-renal azotemia in setting of
   hypertonic tube feeds.
   - Na normalized, may decrease free water flushes
   # Anemia: patient with continued mildly dropping HCT from 28.2 -> 25.4
   over 1 day in the setting of known PUD.
   - re-guiac stool to r/o slow GIB
   - continue to trend daily HCT
s with transfusion if HCT < 23
 will
   avoid transfusion immediately post-extubation to prevent volume
   overload and respiratory strain
   #.Hypothyroidism: will continue on home regimen of levothyroxine,
   switching to PO to decrease free water
   # COPD: continue atrovent and albuterol
   # Adrenal insufficiency: patient transitioned to home decadron dose

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted to the ICU for septic shock, NSTEMI, hypothermia, and suspected pulmonary vs. urine source. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure/PNA, fluid overload, and muscle weakness.

The assessment and plan include continuing meropenem and linezolid for respiratory infection, titrating lasix gtt for diuresis, and planning for extubation. The patient has occasional hypertension but is currently being treated with hydralazine. Amlodipine is being added today to wean down PO hydralazine.

The patient's creatinine levels are trending down from a peak of 3.2, and it is expected to continue monitoring the Cr and UOP. Minimal lasix gtt will be continued to achieve a -1.5L per day.

Other ongoing assessments and plans include monitoring for drug-induced thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, re-guiac stool to rule out slow gastrointestinal bleeding, and avoiding transfusion immediately post-extubation to prevent volume overload and respiratory strain.

The patient has several comorbidities, including hypertension, paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, COPD, diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM):  Increased free water replacement.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Unclear what baseline mental
   status is.  We are continue to treat underlying infections, correcting
   hypernatremia which are likely contributing.

 HYPERGLYCEMIA/DIABETES:  Well controlled on RISS.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY:  Stable.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Growing Acinetobacter
   and MRSA pneumonia. Repeat gram stain shows GNR, culture pending.
   Stable post-extubation albeit still briniging up moderate secretions,
   able to cough to back of throat.  Continue current abx.  More
   comfortable sitting up in chair.  Desaturates with minimal exertion,
   continues high Fi02 requirement. Continue to monitor in ICU.

 UTI: Secondary to VRE on linezolid.  Subsequent cultures are no
   growth to date.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Cr continues
   stable.  Needed to increase lasix drip given decreasing urine output.
   Follow electrolytes, replete K and Mg as needed.  Goal 1L negative over
   next 24 hours.

 ANEMIA:  Hct stable, following daily hcts.

 SCHIZOPHRENIA:  Readdress with psychiatry service as far as
   restarting other medications.
 HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Continues on replacement therapy.

 COPD, ACUTE EXACERBATION IN SETTING OF PNEUMONIA:   Bronchodilators.
 NUTRITION:  Tube feeds at goal.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They have multiple medical conditions and complications, including hypernatremia (high sodium levels), altered mental status, hyperglycemia/diabetes, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, UTI, acute renal failure, anemia, schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, COPD exacerbation, and malnutrition.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening hypernatremia if free water replacement is not properly managed, progression of altered mental status if underlying infections and hypernatremia are not effectively treated, further deterioration of hyperglycemia/diabetes control if insulin management is inadequate, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, worsening respiratory failure if pneumonia is not appropriately treated, recurrence of UTI if linezolid is discontinued prematurely, progression of acute renal failure if fluid balance and electrolyte management is not optimized, worsening anemia if daily hcts are not performed regularly, exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms if antipsychotic medications are not restarted, worsening hypothyroidism if replacement therapy is not maintained, and further exacerbation of COPD in the setting of pneumonia.

These potential complications need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being in the ICU."

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism who presented to the ICU with pneumosepsis versus urosepsis. The patient's sputum cultures are positive for MRSA and Acinetobacter. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/39 to 133/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a face tent.

The patient has received meropenem and linezolid for the MRSA and Acinetobacter pneumonia. Diuretics have been administered to manage fluid overload and pulmonary edema. The patient's hypertension is being managed with hydralazine and amlodipine.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Kidney function appears to be impaired, as indicated by increased creatinine levels. Blood glucose levels have been elevated but within acceptable ranges. Other lab results show abnormalities in electrolytes and liver enzymes.

The patient's medical history includes paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's current medications include levothyroxine, atrovent, albuterol, decadron, and insulin sub"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism who was admitted to the ICU with suspected pneumosepsis versus urosepsis. The patient has sputum cultures positive for MRSA and acinetobacter. He is currently extubated but still requires elevated levels of oxygen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/54 mmHg to 102/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient has received meropenem and linezolid for his pneumonia and is being treated for hypertension with hydralazine and amlodipine. His renal function is improving, and he has a decreasing creatinine level from 3.0 to 1.0 mg/dL. The patient also has anemia, hypernatremia, and hypothyroidism. The plan is to transition the patient to a rehabilitation hospital as he requires significant nursing care. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not effectively treated.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on medication, indicating a potential risk for uncontrolled hypertension.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute kidney injury (ATN) and pre-renal azotemia, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate production, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological complications if not corrected.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid hormone levels are low, requiring ongoing levothyroxine supplementation to prevent associated complications such as bradycardia, hypothermia, and mental status changes.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details may be necessary to assess the patient's condition comprehensively."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism who was admitted with suspected pneumosepsis versus urosepsis. He has now developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by MRSA and Acinetobacter. The patient's current condition includes thick secretions requiring active suctioning, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, fluid overload, and elevated oxygen requirements. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 106/42 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a face mask with 50% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has VAP caused by MRSA and Acinetobacter, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly treated.
2. Hypertension: Although the patient is currently normotensive, his history of hypertension increases the risk of future complications.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney injury, which may be due to septic shock and inadequate perfusion.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels could be attributed to pre-renal azotemia and hypertonic tube feeds. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Anemia: The patient received a blood transfusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism admitted to the ICU for suspected pneumosepsis versus urosepsis due to NSTEMI and Acinetobacter MRSA pneumonia. The patient is extubated but still requires elevated oxygen levels. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure/pneumonia, hypertension, acute kidney injury (ATN), anemia, hypernatremia, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient has Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not effectively treated.
2. Hypertension: The patient's occasional hypertension needs to be monitored and managed appropriately to prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's current kidney function is compromised, and further deterioration may occur if fluid overload and pulmonary edema are not addressed promptly.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, indicating anemia. If left untreated, this could lead to tissue hypoxia and other complications.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as neurological dysfunction.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism requires ongoing management to maintain thyroid hormone levels within the normal range.
7. COPD Exacerbation:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism who was admitted with suspected pneumosepsis versus urosepsis. He is now experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient's current condition includes thick secretions requiring active suctioning, close nursing care, and elevated oxygen requirements despite being extubated. He also has fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient's respiratory failure is due to Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia. Continued fluid overload and pulmonary edema increase the risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. Re-intubation: The patient's airway protection may be compromised, leading to the need for re-intubation.
3. Hypertension: Although the patient is currently normotensive, his blood pressure should be closely monitored, and the dose of Amlodipine may need adjustment.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential AKI, likely due to septic shock and ATN. Aggressive diuresis and close monitoring of renal function are necessary.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may be due to pre-renal azotemia and hypertonic tube feeds. Daily electrolyte monitoring and free water flushes are"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism admitted to the ICU with pneumosepsis versus urosepsis, complicated by NSTEMI and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient was extubated but continued to have thick secretions and elevated oxygen requirements. He appears more somnolent with poor cough.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia in the setting of fluid overload and pulmonary edema. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory failure and potential need for re-intubation for airway protection.
2. Hypertension: The patient remains normotensive but has a history of hypertension. It is important to monitor blood pressure and continue with the prescribed dose of Amlodipine.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Renal Dysfunction: The patient has a decreasing trend in hemoglobin levels from baseline, indicating possible renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of kidney function and aggressive diuresis with Lasix and metolazone is recommended.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to pre-renal azotemia in the setting of hypertonic tube feeds. Regular monitoring of electrolytes and titration of free water flushes are necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was initially admitted with suspected pneumonia versus urosepsis but later developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient has been extubated but continues to have thick secretions and elevated oxygen requirements.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient's recent cultures showed Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia, which could lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Fluid Overload and Pulmonary Edema: The patient has been experiencing fluid overload, as indicated by the negative fluid balance. This can contribute to pulmonary edema and further compromise respiratory function.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled with home Amlodipine, but close monitoring is necessary to ensure it remains within the normal range.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine levels have been increasing despite aggressive diuresis, suggesting a possible AKI. This could be due to septic shock or other underlying factors.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has been experiencing hypernatremia, likely due to pre-renal azotemia and hypertonic tube feeds. Daily electrolyte monitoring and titration of free water flushes are important to manage this condition"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism who was admitted with suspected pneumonia versus urosepsis. The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is now experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient's current condition includes fluid overload and pulmonary edema. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has VAP caused by Acinetobacter and MRSA, which may lead to further respiratory failure if not effectively managed.

2. Mental Status: The patient has paranoid schizophrenia and is scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube on Thursday. The mental status should be closely monitored due to the underlying schizophrenia.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable, but there is a need to continue monitoring and adjust the medication dosage as needed.

4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and decreased blood cell counts indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Aggressive diuresis should be continued to manage fluid overload while monitoring renal function.

5. Anemia: The patient received a blood transfusion with poor reticulocyte output, suggesting possible marrow suppression or low erythropoietin levels. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address the anemia.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism who was initially admitted with suspected pneumosepsis versus urosepsis. He now presents with sputum cultures positive for MRSA and Acinetobacter. The patient is currently extubated but has thick secretions and elevated oxygen requirements. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 125/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, midazolam, and fentanyl. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results indicate elevated troponin-T and lactate levels, as well as decreased albumin and calcium levels."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected pneumonia versus urosepsis. The patient is now intubated due to respiratory secretions and a tiring cough. His current conditions include respiratory failure/pneumonia, hypertension, acute kidney injury, schizophrenia, hypernatremia, anemia, hypothyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus (DM), and feeding tube-related issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia. The presence of fluid overload and pulmonary edema may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include excess secretions and airway protection, fluid overload, and mental status.

2. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, there is a history of hypertension. Continued monitoring and management of blood pressure is necessary.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient has a declining creatinine level from a peak of 4.6 to 2.8, indicating acute kidney injury. This could be a result of septic shock or previous nephrectomy. Aggressive diuresis should be continued, and electrolyte imbalances should be closely monitored.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with suspected pneumonia versus urosepsis and now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by MRSA and acinetobacter. The patient requires a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to continued respiratory secretions and airway protection issues. He also has a large firm submandibular mass with overlying warmth and erythema, which is tender. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has hypertension and hypernatremia. His renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level. The patient has anemia with poor reticulocyte output, suggesting possible marrow suppression or low epo production. He has multiple comorbidities including COPD, diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: The patient has VAP caused by MRSA and acinetobacter. This increases the risk of respiratory failure and further complications such as ventilator-associated lung injury or nosocomial infection spread.
2. Neck Mass: The large firm submandibular mass with overlying warmth and erythema suggests an infection. This could potentially lead to complications like abscess formation or spread of infection.
3. Hypertension: The patient remains normotensive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with pneumonia versus urosepsis and now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient requires tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough. He also has a left submandibular mass with surrounding inflammation and asymmetric enlargement of parotid and submandibular glands, which requires an ENT consult. The patient's current medications include linezolid, meropenem, furosemide, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, midazolam, and fentanyl. His vital signs are stable, but he has fluid overload and pulmonary edema. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and high glucose levels. His imaging shows an ET tube 5 cm above carina, NGT in proximal stomach, bibasilar atelectasis, mild unchanged pulmonary edema, and stable bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure/PNA, hypertension, acute kidney injury (ATN), schizophrenia, hypernatremia, anemia, hypothyroidism, COPD, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, feeding tube, and prophylaxis for"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom w/ paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism
   admitted with pneumosepsis vs, urosepsis c/b by NSTEMI and now VAP with
   acinetobacter and MRSA, now extubated but continued thick [**Last Name (un) **] secretions
   and elevated oxygen requirements.
   ##. Respiratory Failure/PNA:  most recent cultures from [**9-14**] showing
   Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia in setting of fluid overload and
   pulmonary edema.  Patient now re-intubated for airway protection.
   Barriers to extubation include excess secretions and airway protection,
   fluid overload, mental status.
   - mental status: trach / peg for Thursday
   - pneumonia:  continue meropenum (11 of 14) and linezolid  (11 of 14)
   - pulmonary edema: restart lasix drip with metolazone  and add
   acetazolamide for goal of  - 2L / day
 titrating to BP
   # Hypertension
 patient remains normotensive and now transitioned back
   to home Amlodipine dose.
   - continue Amlodipine 10 mg daily
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely resulting from ATN in septic shock state with normal
   baseline 1.8-2, now trending down from peak of 4.6  to 3.0.  Cr remains
   constant despite aggressive diuresis.
   - restart Lasix gtt with Mitolazone and Acetazolamide  for goal of  -2L
   / day, titrating as BP tolerates
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Schizophrenia:  will hold clozaril until linezolid course complete
   for risk of pancyotopenia.  On home dose of perphenzine.
   # Hypernatremia: likely combination of pre-renal azotemia in setting of
   hypertonic tube feeds.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and titrate free water flushes, transition to 200 QID for
   Na of 145
   # Anemia: poor reticulocyte output suggestive marrow suppression or low
   epo as source.  Stool remains guiac negative.
   - trend [**Hospital1 **] HCT and transfuse PRN to goal > 23
   #.Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # COPD: continue atrovent and albuterol
   # Adrenal insufficiency: continue home decadron dose
   # DM: continue insulin SQ with ISS

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism admitted for pneumonia versus urosepsis, possibly due to NSTEMI and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA.
- The patient was extubated but had thick secretions and elevated oxygen requirements, leading to re-intubation.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, acute kidney injury (ATN), hypernatremia, anemia, hypothyroidism, COPD, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and feeding intolerance.
- The patient requires a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for airway protection and nutrition.
- The patient is receiving aggressive diuresis, antibiotics, and other medications to manage their conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not treated effectively.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload and pulmonary edema, which can increase the risk of respiratory distress and heart failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and any further complications or uncontrolled blood pressure can lead to cardiovascular events.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient has ATN with declining renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male admit with sepsis now with persistent respiratory failure
   and move to trach and PEG today.  Importantly he has had evolution of
   his neck mass and CT scan showing adenopathy.
   1)Respiratory Failure-He is limited by substantial secretions,
   persistent volume overload and altered mental status and difficulty
   with compliance with previous attempts at extubation.
   -Diamox/Lasix 10mg//hr for volume
   -Goal 2 liters negative
   -Will continue broad spectrum ABX
   -Will suction PRN now
   -Will pursue trach/PEG today
   -ENT to eval neck mass and plan going forward
will have to assure IP
   comfort with tracheostomy in light of new mass.
   2)Sepsis-Off pressors, able to pursue diuresis
   -Meropenem
   -Diruesis
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is expected to undergo tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of a neck mass, with extensive adenopathy noted on a trans-thoracic echo.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Tracheostomy-related complications: These can include bleeding, infection, tracheal stenosis, or displacement of the tracheostomy tube.

2. PEG-related complications: These can include infection, bleeding, perforation of the stomach or intestines, or leakage of gastric contents.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and further complications may include worsening hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or the need for increased levels of ventilatory support.

4. Sepsis: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for sepsis-related complications such as organ dysfunction, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, or septic shock.

5. Neck mass: The presence of a rapidly enlarging neck mass suggests the possibility of malignancy or infection. Complications can include airway obstruction, difficulty with tracheostomy placement, or spread of infection.

6. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): Given the patient's immob"

","Based on the provided progress note, it appears that the patient is currently in the ICU and requires close monitoring and various treatments. The note includes information about the patient's chief complaint, allergies, medications, medical and family history, review of systems, vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, physical examination findings, laboratory results, imaging studies, microbiology reports, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.

The note also includes an assessment and plan for the patient's ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention, and communication comments.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The presence of antibiotics and microbiology reports suggests that the patient may have an ongoing infection or there is a risk of developing an infection.
2. Respiratory issues: The respiratory support mentioned in the note indicates that the patient may be receiving mechanical ventilation or other forms of respiratory assistance, which carries its own set of complications.
3. DVT: The prophylaxis for DVT implies that the patient may be at an increased risk for developing blood clots in the veins, which can lead to serious complications if not managed properly.
4. Stress ulcers: The mention of stress ulcer prophylaxis suggests that the patient may be at risk for developing stress ulcers, which are sores that can"

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with pneumosepsis vs urosepsis secondary to NSTEMI and now VAP with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient has been re-intubated for airway protection due to continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough. He underwent percutaneous tracheostomy yesterday.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia (high sodium), altered mental status (not delirium), hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, and anemia. He also has a large, firm non-tender mass on the left parotid gland, which is warm and may be due to low secretion in the setting of being chronically NPO. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 106/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels. His electrolytes are slightly imbalanced, with high sodium and low potassium levels. Imaging reveals bilateral pulmonary effusions and pulmonary edema.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism.
- He was admitted with suspected pneumonia versus urinary tract infection, possibly due to non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA.
- The patient required reintubation for airway protection due to continued respiratory secretions and a tiring cough.
- The patient underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy yesterday.
- The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium), altered mental status (not delirium), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF).
- The patient's medical history includes paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, previous nephrectomy, COPD, DM, adrenal insufficiency, and anemia.
- The patient's current medications include amlodipine, perphenazine, levothyroxine, decadron, insulin SQ with ISS, and lansoprazole.
- The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed, including respiratory failure/PNA, neck mass, hypertension, anemia, hypernatremia, renal failure, and schizophrenia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with pneumosepsis vs. urosepsis, possibly secondary to NSTEMI and now VAP with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient had to be reintubated for airway protection due to continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has a recent history of Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia, fluid overload, and pulmonary edema. The tracheostomy placement yesterday may help improve respiratory function.
2. Neck Mass: There is concern for infection given tenderness of adenopathy, overlying erythema, and warmth. This could indicate an infection, possibly leading to cellulitis or abscess formation.
3. Tracheostomy Site Bleeding: The tracheostomy site is still actively bleeding. This could lead to complications such as hematoma formation or airway obstruction if not managed properly.
4. PEG Tube Placement: The patient is scheduled for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement today. There is a risk of complications associated with the procedure, such as bleeding, infection, or perforation.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can be caused by pre-renal azotemia and hypertonic tube feeds. If"

   Total time spent: 38 minutes
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. He has been experiencing a prolonged hospital course and required percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. The patient continues to require ventilatory support and has shown slow weaning attempts. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various interventions are being implemented to manage his respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's continued need for ventilatory support indicates ongoing respiratory failure. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as diuresis with Lasix, should be continued to prevent further deterioration.
3. Sepsis: The patient is still being treated for sepsis with antibiotics. It is crucial to closely monitor for any signs of infection or septic shock and adjust the antibiotic regimen as necessary.
4. Bleeding: The significant oozing around the tracheostomy site is a concern for potential bleeding complications. Proper management strategies, including pharmacological and procedural interventions, should be employed to stabilize the bleeding before transferring the patient to any facility.
5. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility and sedation"

1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia in the setting of fluid overload and pulmonary edema. The barriers to extubation include excess secretions and airway protection, fluid overload, and altered mental status.
2. Neck Mass: There is concern for infection given the tenderness of adenopathy, overlying erythema, and warmth. The mass appears to be caudal and lateral to the airway and does not anticipate any problems with tracheostomy. Warm compresses and massage are recommended every 4 hours.
3. Trach site bleeding: The tracheostomy site is still actively bleeding. Silver nitrate or lidocaine with epinephrine is recommended by IP.
4. PEG placement: The patient is scheduled to have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed today. The patient will be N"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with pneumosepsis versus urosepsis possibly due to NSTEMI and now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient was reintubated for airway protection due to continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough. A tracheostomy tube was placed, and he is currently accepted at Hospital1, waiting for a bed.

The patient's medical history includes paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, previous nephrectomy, and a history of diabetes mellitus. He has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, and hypertension.

The patient's current medications include Amlodipine for hypertension, Clozaril for schizophrenia (held until 2 weeks after completing linezolid course), levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin SQ with ISS for diabetes mellitus, and home doses of perphenazine and decadron.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia in the setting of fluid overload and pulmonary edema. A tracheostomy was performed yesterday. Barriers to extubation include excess secretions and airway protection, fluid overload, and mental status."

   74 yo male admit with sepsis with pulmonary source now with prolonged
   hospital course leading to trach/PEG placment.  He has had continued
   need for ventilatory support with slow wean from ventilator attempted
   but with trach/PEG required for ongoing care.
   1)Respiratory Failure- last day of [**Last Name (un) **]/linezolid today
   Should be able to start trach mask trials
   Trach appears to have no further bleeding at moment --> continue to
   monitor, recheck Hct today
   2)Renal Failure-
   Continues to diurese as tolerated  with Lasix gtt--> goal 2L negative
   If pt remains stable from trach bleeding standpoint, hopefully to
   [**Hospital1 246**] later this weekend

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with sepsis of pulmonary origin. He has been in the hospital for an extended period and required tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has ongoing respiratory failure and requires ventilatory support. He also has hypernatremia, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support and there are ongoing efforts to wean him off the ventilator. However, he still needs a tracheostomy mask trial.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is diuresing as tolerated with Lasix and the goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 2 liters. If the patient remains stable, a possible transfer to another hospital later in the weekend may be considered.

Please note that the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of these complications."

 titrating to BP
   # Neck Mass: concern for infection given tenderness of adenopathy,
   overlying erythema and warmth.  ENT believes this is [**1-20**] to low
   secretion in the setting of being chronically NPO.  Trach performed.
   - warm compresses and massage q4h
   # Trach site
  IP injected lidocaine with epi.
   - monitor bleeding, HCTs have been stable

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with suspected pneumosepsis versus urosepsis caused by NSTEMI and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient underwent reintubation for airway protection due to continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough. A tracheostomy was performed. He is currently accepted at Hospital1, waiting for a bed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with sepsis and a pulmonary source. He has undergone a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to a prolonged hospital course. The patient continues to require ventilatory support and has attempted weaning from the ventilator but remains dependent on the trach/PEG for ongoing care.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be due to the prolonged need for ventilatory support. There is no indication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Anemia: The patient has secondary anemia due to blood loss from hemorrhage/bleeding.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, including hypernatremia (high sodium levels), altered mental status, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), impaired skin integrity, and pulmonary edema.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be a result of his critical illness and prolonged hospital stay.

The plan of care includes continuing tracheostomy mask trials to achieve negative fluid balance of 1 liter per day. The patient's Lasix will be changed from a drip to a bolus. For renal failure, the patient will be transferred to [**Hospital1 246**] when a bed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism admitted to the ICU with pneumosepsis vs. urosepsis, complicated by NSTEMI and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient underwent reintubation for airway protection due to continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough. He has a tracheostomy and is currently accepted at Hospital1, waiting for a bed. The patient's medical history includes COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and schizophrenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has a history of pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter and MRSA, along with fluid overload and pulmonary edema. This poses a risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Neck Mass: The patient has a neck mass that is tender, erythematous, and warm, which could indicate an infection.
3. Tracheostomy Complications: The patient has had a tracheostomy performed, which carries risks such as bleeding, tracheal stenosis, and infection.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension but remains normotensive on home Amlodipine. Monitoring blood pressure levels will be important to prevent complications.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has an elevated baseline creatinine level and has experienced acute kidney injury"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with suspected pneumosepsis or urosepsis, potentially caused by a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient required reintubation for airway protection due to continued respiratory secretions and a tiring cough. A tracheostomy was performed.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure/PNA with fluid overload and pulmonary edema. The barriers to extubation include excess secretions, airway protection, fluid overload, and mental status. The patient completed a 14-day course of antibiotics (meropenem and linezolid), which were stopped on 9/26.

Other ongoing concerns include a neck mass with suspected infection, tracheostomy site monitoring for bleeding, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, hypertension management, acute kidney injury (ATN) with declining creatinine levels, schizophrenia medication adjustment, hypernatremia, anemia, hypothyroidism, COPD, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus (DM), feeding management, and prophylactic measures.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia in the setting of fluid overload and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with suspected pneumosepsis versus urosepsis, complicated by NSTEMI and now ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient had a tracheostomy performed due to continued respiratory secretions and a tiring cough. He is currently awaiting a bed at Hospital1-246.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has pneumonia with Acinetobacter and MRSA, which is a potential source of infection. He also has fluid overload and pulmonary edema, which may contribute to respiratory failure.
2. Neck Mass: There is concern for infection due to tenderness, overlying erythema, and warmth in the neck area. ENT believes this could be due to low secretion in the setting of being chronically nothing by mouth (NPO). A tracheostomy was performed.
3. Trach site: There was bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which was managed with epinephrine injection. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels have been stable.
4. PEG placement: A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed, and the site appears clean and dry. Tube feeding (TF) has been started.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with sepsis and pulmonary source, now with a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, renal failure, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and pulmonary edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there is a need for continued tracheostomy mask during the day. Active diuresis has been stopped for now.

2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function appears to be stable, and arrangements have been made to transfer the patient to [Hospital1] when a bed becomes available.

3. Sepsis: The patient was initially admitted with sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as infection, organ dysfunction, and septic shock.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. This may require insulin therapy or other interventions to control blood sugar levels.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can cause dehydration, neurological symptoms, and electrolyte imbalances.

6. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to various factors like encephalopathy, medication effects"

   74 yo M w/ paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism
   admitted with pneumosepsis vs, urosepsis c/b by NSTEMI and now VAP with
   acinetobacter and MRSA, now re-intubated for airway protection do to
   continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough.  Trach placed.
   Currently accepted at [**Hospital1 246**], waiting for bed.
   #. Respiratory Failure/PNA:  most recent cultures from [**9-14**] showing
   Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia in setting of fluid overload and
   pulmonary edema.  s/p Tracheostomy.  Barriers to extubation include
   excess secretions and airway protection, fluid overload, mental
   status.
   - pneumonia:  completed 14d course both meropenem and linezolid
 abx
   stopped [**9-26**].
   - pulmonary edema: UOP  -1L almost daily, improving pulmonary edema
   .
   # Neck Mass: concern for infection vs inflammation given tenderness of
   adenopathy, overlying erythema and warmth.  ENT believes this is [**1-20**] to
   low secretion in the setting of being chronically NPO.  Trach
   performed.  Now improving.
   - warm compresses and massage q4h
   # Trach site
  IP injected lidocaine with epi.
   - monitor bleeding, HCTs have been stable, given some bleeding for last
   several days IP will be by to look at it
   -applying silver nitrate to area
   #PEG placement
 PEG placed, site appears clean and dry.
   - Started TF
   #Metabolic alkalosis - HCO3- has ranged from 35 to 40 over last week or
   so.  ABG from [**9-26**] is pH of 7.46 - 7.5.    pCO2 is 51, which suggests
   there is respiratory compensation with an additional respiratory
   acidosis on top.  (0.7)(Bicarb) + 20 = pCO expected = 44.  Most likely
   causes of metabolic alkalosis in him is likely a combination of
   contraction alkalosis with some post-hypercapnic alkalosis.  Possibly
   also related to hyperaldosteronism because has refractory hypernatremia
   and has been hypokalemic in past.   Without resolution could make
   extubation more difficult because is promoting compensatory respiratory
   hypoventilation.
   -Consider administration of acetozolamide
   # Hypertension
 patient remains normotensive and now transitioned back
   to home Amlodipine dose.
   - continue Amlodipine 10 mg daily
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely resulting from ATN in septic shock state with normal
   baseline 1.8-2, now trending down from peak of 4.6  to 2.3.  Resolving.
   -Trend creatinines
    # Schizophrenia:  will hold clozaril until 2 weeks after completing
   linezolid course (2 weeks from today), for risk of pancyotopenia.  Can
   restart [**10-10**].  On home dose of perphenzine.
   - prn perphenazine for agitation
   # Hypernatremia: likely combination of renal failure and hypertonic
   tube feeds
   -Talk to nutrition about formula
   -Can increase free water flushes to 250 q6
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -Consider underlying hyperaldosteronism
   # Anemia: HCTs stable, likely secondary to underlying renal disease.
   - trend HCTs daily

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism
   admitted with pneumosepsis vs, urosepsis c/b by NSTEMI and now VAP with
   acinetobacter and MRSA, now re-intubated for airway protection do to
   continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough.  Trach placed.
   Currently accepted at [**Hospital1 246**], waiting for bed.
   #. Respiratory Failure/PNA:  most recent cultures from [**9-14**] showing
   Acinetobacter and MRSA pneumonia in setting of fluid overload and
   pulmonary edema.  s/p Tracheostomy.  Barriers to extubation include
   excess secretions and airway protection, fluid overload, mental
   status.
   - pneumonia:  completed 14d course both meropenem and linezolid
 abx
   stopped [**9-26**].
   - pulmonary edema: UOP  -1L almost daily, improving pulmonary edema
   .
   # Neck Mass: concern for infection vs inflammation given tenderness of
   adenopathy, overlying erythema and warmth.  ENT believes this is [**1-20**] to
   low secretion in the setting of being chronically NPO.  Trach
   performed.  Now improving.
   - warm compresses and massage q4h
   # Trach site
  IP injected lidocaine with epi.
   - monitor bleeding, HCTs have been stable, given some bleeding for last
   several days IP will be by to look at it
   -applying silver nitrate to area
   #PEG placement
 PEG placed, site appears clean and dry.
   - Started TF
   #Metabolic alkalosis - HCO3- has ranged from 35 to 40 over last week or
   so.  ABG from [**9-26**] is pH of 7.46 - 7.5.    pCO2 is 51, which suggests
   there is respiratory compensation with an additional respiratory
   acidosis on top.  (0.7)(Bicarb) + 20 = pCO expected = 44.  Most likely
   causes of metabolic alkalosis in him is likely a combination of
   contraction alkalosis with some post-hypercapnic alkalosis.  Possibly
   also related to hyperaldosteronism because has refractory hypernatremia
   and has been hypokalemic in past.   Without resolution could make
   extubation more difficult because is promoting compensatory respiratory
   hypoventilation.
   -Consider administration of acetozolamide
   # Hypertension
 patient remains normotensive and now transitioned back
   to home Amlodipine dose.
   - continue Amlodipine 10 mg daily
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely resulting from ATN in septic shock state with normal
   baseline 1.8-2, now trending down from peak of 4.6  to 2.3.  Resolving.
   -Trend creatinines
    # Schizophrenia:  will hold clozaril until 2 weeks after completing
   linezolid course (2 weeks from today), for risk of pancyotopenia.  Can
   restart [**10-10**].  On home dose of perphenzine.
   - prn perphenazine for agitation
   # Hypernatremia: likely combination of renal failure and hypertonic
   tube feeds
   -Talk to nutrition about formula
   -Can increase free water flushes to 250 q6
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -Consider underlying hyperaldosteronism
   # Anemia: HCTs stable, likely secondary to underlying renal disease.
   - trend HCTs daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with paranoid schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, and hypoadrenalism. He was admitted with pneumosepsis versus urosepsis caused by NSTEMI and now VAP with Acinetobacter and MRSA. The patient has been reintubated for airway protection due to continued respiratory secretions and tiring cough. Tracheostomy was performed.

The patient has several medical conditions that require ongoing management:

1. Respiratory Failure/PNA: The patient has pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter and MRSA, along with pulmonary edema. He completed a 14-day course of meropenem and linezolid antibiotics. The patient is still experiencing fluid overload and mental status issues, which are barriers to extubation.

2. Neck Mass: There is concern for infection versus inflammation given the tenderness of adenopathy, overlying erythema, and warmth. The ENT believes this is likely due to low secretions in the setting of being chronically NPO. Tracheostomy was performed, and the area is improving.

3. Trach site: The patient experienced bleeding from the tracheostomy site, but his HCTs have been stable. Silver nitrate is being applied to the area.

4. PEG placement: The patient had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and the site appears clean and dry. Tube feeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with sepsis and a pulmonary source. He underwent a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently on prolonged mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube during the day. He has experienced multiple complications during his hospital stay, including respiratory failure, renal failure, tracheostomy site bleeding, hypernatremia, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for sepsis with a pulmonary source. Tracheostomy mask trials during the day should be continued to assess the patient's ability to breathe independently.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function appears stable, indicating that the acute renal failure is currently well-managed.

3. Tracheostomy Site Bleeding: The bleeding has slowed down, but further evaluation by interventional procedures (IP) is recommended. Injection of fibrin glue or other hemostatic agents may be considered to promote healing and prevent further bleeding.

4. Hypernatremia: Increasing fluid intake by fH20 flushes can help correct the high sodium levels in the blood.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: Regular turning and skin care protocols should be implemented to prevent further skin breakdown and potential infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and septic shock, which has since been resolved. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable. There have been no further bleeding incidents at the tracheostomy site overnight. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the noted events above.

Vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/59 mmHg to 149/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient appears comfortable without any pain complaints. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are ongoing.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, clear breath sounds with symmetric chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace lower extremity edema, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. Lab results show stable levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes over the past few days.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple ongoing medical complications including anemia secondary to blood loss, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pulmonary edema, hypernatremia, altered mental"
