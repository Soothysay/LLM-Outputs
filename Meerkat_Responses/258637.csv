   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on EGD
   tonight, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed.
   Has received 2 units pRBC and 2 units FFP (INR 2.6).  Remains HD
   stable. Ddx includes gastric varices (visualization impaired by clotted
   blood), PUD (gastric or duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days and pantoprazole gtt for now
   - D/c prednisone
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25 (will
   give 1 unit pRBCs now)
   - Goal INR < 2.0 (will give 1 unit FFP now)
   - Keep NPO for now, consider clears in AM if stable
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (will alert IR)
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic function, significant ascites (reaccumulation
   despite 3L para on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension, and now evidence of
   esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs, coags
   - D/c prednisone as above
   - Continue pentoxyfilline for now; confirm with Liver
   - F/u liver bx
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - NPO for now but low Na when resumes diets
   - Check bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx now growing E. coli. C. diff negative.
   [**4-14**] paracentesis not c/w SBP
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI
   - F/u micro
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to liver failure with hypovolemia, improving
   - Cont to monitor on fluid restriction
   - F/u renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ETOH use: No evidence with withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work has been consulted
   # AMS: Likely secondary to sedation from morphine this AM. No evidence
   of encephalopathy, but if pt becomes confused or develops asterixis,
   would consider lactulose PO/PR.
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   # Tachycardia: Possibly related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain.
   - Will monitor after transfusions

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure presenting with significant hematemesis. She underwent banding of esophageal varices and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient remains hemodynamically stable, but there are concerns about potential complications.

Based on the progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient initially presented with hematemesis, which was attributed to esophageal varices. Although the bleeding has been controlled with banding, there is a risk of re-bleeding or bleeding from other sources such as gastric varices, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), Mallory-Weiss tear, or malignancy.

2. Acute on Chronic Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is likely due to ethanol abuse. This condition can lead to complications like ascites, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices. Monitoring liver function tests, coagulation profile, and considering interventions like therapeutic paracentesis or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be necessary.

3. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and fever, which could be related to acute hepatitis, prednisone use, or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Cultures have been obtained"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on EGD
   tonight, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed.
   Has received 2 units pRBC and 2 units FFP (INR 2.6).  Remains HD
   stable. Ddx includes gastric varices (visualization impaired by clotted
   blood), PUD (gastric or duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days and pantoprazole gtt for now
   - D/c prednisone
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   - Keep NPO for now, consider clears in AM if stable
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization
   - If rebleeds, would need to consider TIPS
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic function, significant ascites (reaccumulation
   despite 3L para on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension, and now evidence of
   esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs, coags
   - D/c prednisone as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure presenting with significant hematemesis, which was successfully managed with banding of esophageal varices. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The differential diagnosis for the gastrointestinal bleed includes gastric varices, peptic ulcer disease, Mallory-Weiss tear, and malignancy. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact source of bleeding. She will continue receiving octreotide and pantoprazole infusions, and her blood products will be monitored closely. She is also being treated prophylactically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and possible clot stabilization. If there is rebleeding, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be considered. The patient's acute-on-chronic liver failure is likely due to alcohol-related liver disease, and she will require ongoing monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation status. Other concerns include leukocytosis/fever, hyponatremia, and potential ETOH withdrawal."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure presenting with significant hematemesis. She has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since April 16th, as well as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate. Her hematocrit (HCT) stabilized after transfusions, and conservative management is planned for now.

The patient has been diagnosed with esophageal varices, which were banded four times without further evidence of active bleeding. Other possible sources of bleeding include gastric varices, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), Mallory-Weiss tear, and malignancy. Octreotide and pantoprazole are being continued for now.

The patient has acute-on-chronic liver failure with an etiology most consistent with alcohol use. She has synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites (reaccumulation despite paracentesis on April 14th), portal hypertension, and evidence of esophageal varices. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation parameters is ongoing. A liver biopsy is pending.

The patient also has leukocytosis/fever, likely from acute hepatitis, prednisone, or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Ceftriaxone is being continued for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis and UTI coverage.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure, presenting with significant hematemesis and esophageal varices. She has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of cryoprecipitate. Her hemodynamic status has stabilized after transfusions. The plan is to manage her conservatively for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding from the esophageal varices, especially if they were not fully ligated during the banding procedure.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's acute-on-chronic liver failure, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose has been started to manage this condition.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which may indicate an infection. She is already receiving ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis and to cover a urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be due to liver failure and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of electrolytes is essential.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: Although there is no evidence of withdrawal at present, the patient's history of ETOH use should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms.

","The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure presenting with significant hematemesis. She has undergone banding of esophageal varices, received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 2 units of cryoprecipitate. Her hemodynamic stability has been maintained, but she remains at risk for re-bleeding. The differential diagnosis includes gastric varices, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), Mallory-Weiss tear, and malignancy.

The plan includes continuing octreotide and pantoprazole, monitoring the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and coagulation profile, transfusing PRBCs and FFP as needed to maintain a target Hct of 25% and INR < 2.0, respectively. The patient will be kept nil per os (NPO) for now and will receive nutritional support as tolerated. Ceftriaxone has been initiated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis and possible role in clot stabilization.

In addition, the patient is being evaluated for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) if re-bleeds occur. She also has acute-on-chronic liver failure, most consistent with an etiology related to alcohol use. This is supported by evidence of portal hypertension, esophageal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with a history of ETOH hepatitis, currently admitted to the ICU. She presented with dark red emesis and melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed grade III varices with significant bleeding in the stomach. The patient received blood transfusions and was started on octreotide to reduce portal hypertension. Her hemoglobin concentration has stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: The patient is at risk for recurrent variceal bleeding due to the presence of large varices in the stomach. Continuous monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent further bleeding.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction. Monitoring for signs of encephalopathy and managing ammonia levels is essential.

3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and indwelling lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections. Frequent cultures and strict infection control measures are important.

4. Hepatitis C recurrence: As the patient has a history of ETOH hepatitis, there is a possibility of recurrence or progression of hepatitis C infection. Close follow-up with hepatology is necessary to monitor liver function and consider antiviral therapy.

5. Renal dysfunction"

   # ETOH use: No evidence for withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work input appreciated

   # AMS: Likely hepatic encephalopathy in setting of hepatic dysfunction.
   - Lactulose PO/PR, rifaximin
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure presenting with significant hematemesis. She has undergone banding of esophageal varices without further evidence of active bleeding. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her hemodynamic status is currently stable, and she is receiving octreotide and pantoprazole per liver team recommendations. The differential diagnosis includes gastric varices, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), Mallory-Weiss tear, and malignancy. 

The patient also has acute-on-chronic liver failure with evidence of ethanol etiology, including synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices. She is being monitored for liver function tests, coagulation profile, and MELD score. The patient is also on pentoxyphylline, rifaximin, lactulose, and albumin for therapeutic paracentesis. 

Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis and fever, likely secondary to acute hepatitis or prednisone use, as well as a urinary tract infection (UTI) confirmed by urine culture. C. difficile is negative, and she is receiving ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis and UTI coverage. 

The patient has altered sodium balance and is being managed with free water deficit calculation and low-sodium diet. She also has evidence"

   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis/Melena: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on
   EGD, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed. Has
   received 6 units pRBC total since [**4-16**] (including 3 during morning of
   [**4-17**], none [**2097-4-17**]), 6u FFP, 2u cryo.  Remains HD stable. Ddx includes
   gastric varices (visualization impaired by clotted blood), PUD (gastric
   or duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt (day 1 = [**4-16**]) and pantoprazole gtt per liver
   team
   - Prednisone discontinued per liver team as may increase bleeding
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   - Transfuse FFP for goal INR < 2.0
   - ADAT by mental status (now taking sips)
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization (day
   1 = [**4-16**])
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (IR evaluated pt on [**4-17**])
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites
   (reaccumulation despite 3L paracentesis on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension,
   and now evidence of esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs qd, coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Prednisone discontinued as above
   - Continue pentoxyfilline (day 1 = [**4-12**])
   - F/u liver bx (pending)
   - Therapeutic paracentesis when stable followed by albumin [**6-6**] g/L of
   fluid removed
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Low sodium diet when tolerating POs
   - Monitor bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if
   elevated (18 on [**4-17**] at 11pm; 16 on [**4-18**] at 6pm)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx growing E. coli. C. diff negative. [**4-14**]
   paracentesis not c/w SBP. Leukocytosis continues [**4-19**] despite stopping
   prednisone and appropriate treatment for UTI.
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI (day 1 = [**4-16**]) for 3
   day course for UTI (Foley inserted [**4-17**])
   - F/u micro
   - CIS
   .
   # Altered sodium balance: Initially hyponatremic, then resolved, Na 146
   on [**4-19**]. Free water deficit calculated at 2L.
   - Recheck in afternoon; if still elevated start D5W at 100cc/hr for 1L
   total as tolerated.
   - Cont to monitor on fluid restriction
   - Appreciate renal recs; team has now signed off.
   - Daily electrolytes
   .
   # ETOH use: No evidence for withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work input appreciated
   # AMS: Likely hepatic encephalopathy in setting of hepatic dysfunction.
   - Lactulose PO/PR, rifaximin
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain. Concern for occult infection though afebrile.
   - Will monitor
   # FEN: IVFs, monitor/replete electrolytes, sips (when taking POs will
   use 1L fluid restriction and low sodium diet)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure presenting with significant hematemesis. She has undergone banding of esophageal varices and received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) since April 16th. The source of bleeding appears to be esophageal varices, but other potential sources such as gastric varices, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), Mallory-Weiss tear, or malignancy have not been ruled out.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is somnolent but oriented to city, hospital, and year, although not to the month. Physical examination findings include sclera icteric, multiple telangiectasias on the face, distended abdomen with positive fluid wave, and a regular rhythm with a II/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1 thousand/mm³, hematocrit of 26.7%, platelet count of 109 thousand/mm³, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 15.8 mg/d"

   - Continue octreotide gtt (day 1 = [**4-16**]) and pantoprazole gtt per liver
   team
   - Prednisone discontinued per liver team as may increase bleeding
   - Active T&S, q8h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   - Transfuse FFP for goal INR < 2.0
   - ADAT by mental status (now taking sips)
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization (day
   1 = [**4-16**])
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (IR evaluated pt on [**4-17**])
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites
   (reaccumulation despite 3L paracentesis on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension,
   and now evidence of esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs qd, coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**4-19**]: MELD 24, discriminant function 56
   - Prednisone discontinued due to risk of bleeding
   - Continue pentoxyfilline (day 1 = [**4-12**]), rifaximin, lactulose
   - F/u liver bx (pending)
   - Therapeutic paracentesis when stable followed by albumin [**6-6**] g/L of
   fluid removed
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Low sodium diet when tolerating POs
   - Monitor bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if
   elevated (18 on [**4-17**] at 11pm; 16 on [**4-18**] at 6pm)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx growing E. coli. C. diff negative. [**4-14**]
   paracentesis not c/w SBP. Leukocytosis continues [**4-19**] despite stopping
   prednisone and appropriate treatment for UTI.
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI (day 1 = [**4-16**]) for 3
   day course for UTI (Foley inserted [**4-17**])
   - F/u micro
   - CIS
   .
   # Altered sodium balance: Initially hyponatremic, then resolved, Na 146
   on [**4-19**]. Free water deficit calculated at 2L.
   - Pt thirsty, will give PO water as tolerated by mental status and
   otherwise start 1L NS 100cc/hr
   - Cont to monitor on fluid restriction
   - Appreciate renal recs; team has now signed off
   - Daily electrolytes
   .
   # ETOH use: No evidence for withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work input appreciated
   .
   # AMS: Likely hepatic encephalopathy in setting of hepatic dysfunction.
   - Lactulose PO/PR, rifaximin
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain. Concern for occult infection though afebrile.
   - Will monitor
   # FEN: IVFs, monitor/replete electrolytes, advance diet as tolerate by
   mental status, now on sips (when taking POs will use 1L fluid

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure presenting with significant hematemesis. She underwent banding of esophageal varices and received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with a current hematocrit (Hct) level of 26.1. The source of bleeding appears to be esophageal varices, although gastric varices and peptic ulcer disease are also considered. The patient is currently receiving octreotide and pantoprazole. She has received 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate. Her mental status is altered, and she is only taking sips of oral intake. Ceftriaxone is being administered for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis and possible clot stabilization. If rebleeding occurs, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement may be considered. The patient has evidence of acute-on-chronic liver failure with EtOH etiology, including synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices. She is monitored for liver function tests, coagulation parameters, and MELD score. She also has leukocytosis and fever, likely due to acute hepatitis, prednisone, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). Ceftriaxone is continued for SBP prophylaxis and UTI coverage"
