   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG & MI, Metastatic Carcinoid and
   chronic abd/back pain who presents with decreased po intake, diarrhea,
   lethargy and hypotension found to have colitis on CT.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Pt with lethargy, hypotension that has transiently
   responded to IV boluses but continues to require low dose levophed,
   then requiring three pressors.  Pt is a vasculopath with complex
   arterial anatomy, recently discharged after NSTEMI.  CT ruled out
   ruptured AAA and stool guaic was negative.   Differential includes
   sepsis, hypovolemic, GI bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely to be MI
   or adrenal insufficiency.  Most likely is sepsis in setting of colitis
   and peritonitis.
   - bolus IVF prn to goal CVP>12
   - wean pressors today as tolerated; has subclavian stenosis with
   difficult time to determine blood pressure, are weaning to mental
   status as well as blood pressures from legs
   - Vanc/Zosyn for possible diverticulitis/colitis
   - start empiric Flagyl and po Vanc for possible CDiff colitis
   - f/u blood/urine/stool cx
 no obvious source yet
   .
   # Abd pain/diarrhea: Pt is a known vasculopath who p/w 2-3 days of dark
   loose stools and poor po intake after completing a course of Abx for
   PNA. Per family, no fevers at home but pt reports subjective chills.
   WBC ct of 20 and CT with colitis.  Concern for C Diff colitis vs
   ischemic colitis, though may be less likely given normal lactate.  SBP
   also possible, will send fluid from peritoneal cath.  Pt was seen by
   gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] and vasc surgery in ED, no plan for OR.  Pt expressed goals of
   care to avoid heroic measures, confirmed by HCP.
   - following lactates, does have increasing gap acidosis today, unclear
   etiology, possibly from ischemia
   - bolus IVF
   - type & cross
   - started empiric Flagyl & Po Vanc for c.diff, results pending
   - dilaudid prn for pain, improved today
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for possible diverticulitis and peritonitis
   - per [**Doctor First Name 458**], can start to advance diet slowly with serial abd exams as
   long as making stool
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG/NSTEMI: pt is currently denying CP, EKGs at baseline.
   CK/MB flat and troponin continues to trend down from max of 30 during
   prior admission, continue to follow
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Plavix 75mg daily
   - hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # ESRD on PD: renal following, plan for PD today
   - send fluid from PD cath for Cx
 no organisms seen on gram stain
   - continue Calcitriol
   - added epo and phos binder per renal recs
   .
   # Ureteral stent
 urology consulted for hyperdense finding in CT scan,
   thought to possibly be blood.  Urology reviewed scan and did not think
   any intervention at this time was needed, especially in setting of this
   infection.
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct in low 30s, down to 23 with IVF.  Now concern
   for lower GI bleed given colitis and dark stool, though guaic negative
   on exam.
   - type & cross
   - CVL and PIV
   - PPI & trend hct, hct has been stable
   .
   # Metastatic Carcinoid: Pt with known liver mets followed by hem/onc
   with apparent worsening disease on CT
   - f/u hem/onc as outpt
   .
   # FEN: can start with clears
   - replete electrolytes aggressively, PD today for hyperkalemia
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin sc tid, PPI

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI), metastatic carcinoid, chronic abdominal and back pain. He presented with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension. A CT scan showed colitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension that has temporarily responded to IV boluses but continues to require low-dose vasopressor support. Differential diagnoses include sepsis, hypovolemia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely to be myocardial infarction (MI) or adrenal insufficiency.

2. Colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with colitis, which may be caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection or ischemic colitis. The treatment plan includes empiric antibiotics for possible diverticulitis/colitis, as well as starting empiric Flagyl and oral vancomycin for possible C. diff colitis.

3. Abdominal pain and diarrhea: The patient is a known vasculopath who reports 2-3 days of dark loose stools and poor oral intake after completing a course of antibiotics for pneumonia. There is concern for C. diff colitis versus ischemic colitis, although the normal lactate"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG & MI, Metastatic Carcinoid and
   chronic abd/back pain who presents with decreased po intake, diarrhea,
   lethargy and hypotension found to have colitis on CT.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Pt with lethargy, hypotension that has transiently
   responded to IV boluses but continues to require low dose levophed,
   then requiring three pressors.  Pt is a vasculopath with complex
   arterial anatomy, recently discharged after NSTEMI.  CT ruled out
   ruptured AAA and stool guaic was negative.   Differential includes
   sepsis, hypovolemic, GI bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely to be MI
   or adrenal insufficiency.  Most likely is sepsis in setting of colitis
   and peritonitis.
   - bolus IVF prn to goal CVP>12
   - pressors off [**3-5**]; has subclavian stenosis with difficult time to
   determine blood pressure, weaned to mental status as well as blood
   pressures from legs
   - Vanc/Zosyn for possible diverticulitis/colitis
   - Flagyl and po Vanc for possible CDiff colitis
   - f/u blood/urine/stool cx
 no obvious source yet
   .
   # Abd pain/diarrhea: Pt is a known vasculopath who p/w 2-3 days of dark
   loose stools and poor po intake after completing a course of Abx for
   PNA. Per family, no fevers at home but pt reports subjective chills.
   WBC ct of 20 and CT with colitis.  Concern for C Diff colitis vs
   ischemic colitis, though may be less likely given normal lactate.  SBP
   also possible, will send fluid from peritoneal cath.  Pt was seen by
   gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] and vasc surgery in ED, no plan for OR.  Pt expressed goals of
   care to avoid heroic measures, confirmed by HCP.
   - following lactates, does have gap acidosis today, unclear etiology,
   possibly from ischemia
   - bolus IVF
   - started empiric Flagyl & Po Vanc for c.diff, results pending
   - dilaudid prn for pain, improved today
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for possible diverticulitis and peritonitis
   - per [**Doctor First Name 458**], can start to advance diet slowly with serial abd exams as
   long as making stool
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG/NSTEMI: pt is currently denying CP, EKGs at baseline.
   CK/MB flat and troponin continues to trend down from max of 30 during
   prior admission, continue to follow
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Plavix 75mg daily
   - hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # ESRD on PD: renal following, plan for PD
   - PD cath Cx
 no organisms seen on gram stain
   - continue Calcitriol
   - added epo and phos binder per renal recs
   .
   # Ureteral stent
 urology consulted for hyperdense finding in CT scan,
   thought to possibly be blood.  Urology reviewed scan and did not think
   any intervention at this time was needed, especially in setting of this
   infection.
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct in low 30s, down to 23 with IVF.  Now concern
   for lower GI bleed given colitis and dark stool, though guaic negative
   on exam.
   - type & cross
   - CVL and PIV
   - PPI & trend hct, hct has been stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI), metastatic carcinoid, chronic abdominal and back pain. He presents with decreased oral intake, lethargy, hypotension, and diarrhea. He has been diagnosed with colitis on CT scan. The patient's current condition includes hypotension requiring pressors, possible sepsis, acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, and metastatic carcinoid.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection (diarrhea, elevated WBC count) and is already on antibiotics. If the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are ineffective, sepsis may develop, leading to organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has hyperkalemia. AKI can worsen his renal function and lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
3. Anemia: The patient's hct is low, indicating anemia. If there is ongoing bleeding or inadequate production of red blood cells, his anemia could worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Metastatic Carcinoid: The patient has metastatic carcinoid disease, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of pain, which has been better controlled with dilaudid. The patient underwent peritoneal dialysis (PD) as recommended by the renal team and was successfully weaned off all pressors in the early afternoon. However, the patient developed new acidosis with a lactate level of 4.0 and received an intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus. The patient also has worsening transaminitis, likely due to shock liver. The patient attempted feeding but was not hungry and only ate almost nothing.

Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTHERMIA: The patient's current temperature is 35.6Â°C (96.1Â°F), indicating hypothermia.
2. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure ranges from 93/48 mmHg to 151/82 mmHg, suggesting hypotension.
3. RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE): The patient has chronic renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
4. PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): The patient is experiencing pain, which has been partially controlled with dilaudid.
5. Other potential complications may include acidosis, transaminitis, and potential infections based on the medications administered."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG and MI, metastatic carcinoid, and chronic abdominal and back pain. He presents with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with colitis on CT and has several medical complications including ESRD on PD, ureteral stent, anemia, and metastatic carcinoid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection (colitis, elevated WBC count) and is currently on antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) for possible diverticulitis/colitis. There is a concern for sepsis, especially in the setting of colitis and peritonitis.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to require low-dose vasopressor support and has had episodes of hypotension unresponsive to IV boluses. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, GI bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely myocardial infarction or adrenal insufficiency.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESRD on PD. There is a concern for worsening AKI, especially if the patient becomes hypotensive or if there is inadequate fluid resuscitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic renal failure, acute pain, and hypothermia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6Â°C (96.1Â°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 93/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH of 7.19.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is receiving peritoneal dialysis. They have been weaned off all pressors in the early afternoon. The patient's pain is better controlled with dilaudid, but they have worsening transaminitis, likely due to shock liver. The patient received a bolus of IV fluids for new acute-on-chronic acidosis with lactate levels of 4.0.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient is also receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the worsening transaminitis. The patient's flow sheet data shows a positive fluid balance of 35 mL and a negative urine output balance of 564 mL over the past 24"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall male with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypothermia. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, acute pain, and chronic pain. On 24-hour events, the patient had several interventions including PICC request placement, NGT placement and tube feeds started, continued peritoneal dialysis, placement of percutaneous tracheostomy, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 121/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, flagyl, zosyn, pantoprazole, and hydromorphone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature indicates hypothermia. This condition can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This can result in inadequate tissue perfusion, organ ischemia, and potential shock.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's history of chronic renal failure suggests underlying kidney damage. Complications associated with chronic renal failure include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased susceptibility to infections"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient is moderately lethargic but responsive and oriented to place. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 121/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,109 mL and total output of 1,530 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 421 mL.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypothermia, hypotension (not in shock), chronic renal failure, and pain control. The patient's renal function is indicated by elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, suggesting an infection or inflammation. The platelet count (Plt) is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in liver function tests, including elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels. There are also elevated levels of amylase and lipase, indicating possible pancreatic involvement. Other abnormalities include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low albumin level, and abnormal electrolyte levels, including calcium"

   78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG & MI, Metastatic Carcinoid and
   chronic abd/back pain who presents with decreased po intake, diarrhea,
   lethargy and hypotension found to have colitis on CT.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Pt with lethargy, hypotension that has transiently
   responded to IV boluses but continues to require low dose levophed,
   then requiring three pressors.  Pt is a vasculopath with complex
   arterial anatomy, recently discharged after NSTEMI.  CT ruled out
   ruptured AAA and stool guaic was negative.   Differential includes
   sepsis, hypovolemic, GI bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely to be MI
   or adrenal insufficiency.  Most likely is sepsis in setting of colitis
   and peritonitis.
   - bolus IVF prn for hypotension, titrate to MS
   - pressors off [**3-5**]; has subclavian stenosis with difficult time to
   determine blood pressure, weaned to mental status as well as blood
   pressures from legs
   - Vanc/Zosyn for possible diverticulitis/colitis
   - Flagyl and po Vanc for possible CDiff colitis
   - f/u blood/urine/stool cx
 no obvious source yet
   .
   # Abd pain/diarrhea: Pt is a known vasculopath who p/w 2-3 days of dark
   loose stools and poor po intake after completing a course of Abx for
   PNA. Per family, no fevers at home but pt reports subjective chills.
   WBC ct of 20 and CT with colitis.  Concern for C Diff colitis vs
   ischemic colitis, though may be less likely given normal lactate.  SBP
   also possible, will send fluid from peritoneal cath.  Pt was seen by
   gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] and vasc surgery in ED, no plan for OR.  Pt expressed goals of
   care to avoid heroic measures, confirmed by HCP.
   - following lactates
   - started empiric Flagyl & Po Vanc for c.diff, results pending
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for possible diverticulitis and peritonitis
   - bisacodyl PR
   - per [**Doctor First Name 458**], can start to advance diet slowly with serial abd exams as
   long as making stool
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG/NSTEMI: pt is currently denying CP, EKGs at baseline.
   CK/MB flat and troponin continues to trend down from max of 30 during
   prior admission, continue to follow
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Plavix 75mg daily
   - hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # ESRD on PD: renal following, plan for PD
   - PD cath Cx
 no organisms seen on gram stain
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue Calcitriol
   - added epo and phos binder per renal recs
   .
   # Ureteral stent
 urology consulted for hyperdense finding in CT scan,
   thought to possibly be blood.  Urology reviewed scan and did not think
   any intervention at this time was needed, especially in setting of this
   infection.

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting and myocardial infarction, metastatic carcinoid, chronic abdominal and back pain. He presented with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension. He was found to have colitis on CT scan.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires low-dose levophed, then requiring three pressors. The differential includes sepsis, hypovolemic, GI bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely to be MI or adrenal insufficiency. Sepsis in the setting of colitis and peritonitis is the most likely cause. 
- Bolus IV fluids as needed for hypotension, titrate to mean systemic pressure (MS)
- Pressors off on 3/5; has subclavian stenosis with difficult time to determine blood pressure, weaned to mental status as well as blood pressures from legs
- Vanc/Zosyn for possible diverticulitis/colitis
- Flagyl and po Vanc for possible CDiff colitis
- Follow-up blood/urine/stool cultures

2. Abdominal pain/diarrhea: The patient has dark loose stools and poor oral intake after completing a course of antibiotics for pneumonia. WBC count is 20 and CT scan"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI), metastatic carcinoid, chronic abdominal and back pain. He presented with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension, and was found to have colitis on CT scan. The patient has been improving but now appears to be complicated by ileus/small bowel obstruction (SBO). There is a concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis versus ischemic colitis, although the latter seems less likely due to normal lactate levels. Other potential complications to consider include septic shock, hypovolemic shock, gastrointestinal bleed, and ischemic colitis.

Medical Complications:
1. Colitis: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and the CT findings indicate colitis, which could be due to C. diff infection or ischemic colitis.
2. Ileus/SBO: The patient's current presentation suggests a possible ileus/SBO, which is a complication of colitis.
3. Shock: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status raise concern for septic shock, especially in the setting of colitis and peritonitis. Other causes of shock such as hypovolemic, GI bleed, and ischemic colitis should also be considered.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's dark"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall male with a history of chronic renal failure, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with hypothermia, hypotension, and acute pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 110/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is mildly lethargic but responsive and oriented to place. Physical examination reveals mild abdominal tenderness without guarding or distention. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient has been receiving various medications including narcan, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and metronidazole. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests may suggest an infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Given the patient's chronic renal failure and recent fluid balance data showing a significant loss of fluids, there is a risk of developing AKI. Fluid management should be closely monitored to prevent further renal impairment.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's fluctuating blood glucose levels indicate the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypothermia and hypotension. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and requires pain management due to acute and chronic pain. 

Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTHERMIA: The patient is experiencing low body temperature, which can lead to various complications such as decreased metabolic rate, impaired organ function, and increased risk of infection.
2. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating poor perfusion and potential inadequate oxygen and nutrient delivery to organs and tissues. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not promptly addressed.
3. CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient has a pre-existing kidney condition that may worsen in the ICU due to factors like decreased renal perfusion, medication use, and other comorbidities. Chronic renal failure can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremia.
4. PAIN CONTROL: The patient requires management of both acute and chronic pain. Inadequate pain control can lead to patient discomfort, increased stress response, and potential complications such as delirium, immobility, and prolonged recovery.
5. OTHER LAB ABNORMALITIES: The patient's lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and other markers."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG & MI, Metastatic Carcinoid and
   chronic abd/back pain who presents with decreased po intake, diarrhea,
   lethargy and hypotension found to have colitis on CT. Now with
   ileus/SBO.
   .
   # presumptive Cdiff
 Presenation was 2-3 days of dark loose stools and
   poor po intake after completing a course of Abx for PNA. Per family, no
   fevers at home but pt reports subjective chills. WBC ct of 20 and CT
   with colitis.  Concern for C Diff colitis vs ischemic colitis,
   complicated by sepsis
 requiring pressor support.  SBP also possible,
   had high WBC count but no organisms grew.  Pt was seen by gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] and
   vasc surgery in ED, no plan for OR.  Pt expressed goals of care to
   avoid heroic measures, confirmed by HCP. [**Name (NI) 53**] on contact
   precautions.  C.diff has been complicated by what appears to be ileus,
   although SBO is still a possibility.
   - Zozyn for possible diverticulitis, will complete a 10 day course, no
   day [**7-30**]
   - Flagyl and po Vanc and IV vanco for possible CDiff colitis
   - c.diff toxin negative, but still is likely the cause
   - pt with likely ileus, but had bowel movement yesterday
 gen [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   reconsulted and following again.  Will keep NGT on intermittent wall
   suction, remains NPO for bowel rest, continue bowel regimen and
   consider PO narcan as needed
   - holding narcotics, seems comfortable
   # peritonitis
 spoke to renal today, should give vanc for the full two
   week course, and will check peritoneal fluid again, they will continue
   PD through this infection.
   - vanc dosing should be 750 mg when daily vanco level is below 15
   # Shock liver
 LFTs peaked now trending down, patient continues to
   have coagulopathy, both improving
   .
   # altered Mental status
 waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**], maybe baseline, maybe
   uremia v. narcotic usage
   - giving slight ativan since anxiety playing element in pain
   - stopping dilaudid for now, patient remains comfortable
   .
   # Hypotension:  Resolved, patient is severe vasculopath and pressures
   are difficult to determine. Patient was initially started on levo and
   then moved to three pressors. He has bilateral subclavian stenosis with
   difficult time to determine blood pressure, weaned to mental status as
   well as blood pressures from legs. CT ruled out ruptured AAA and stool
   guaic was negative.   Differential includes sepsis, hypovolemic, GI
   bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely to be MI or adrenal
   insufficiency.  Most likely is sepsis in setting of colitis and
   peritonitis. Pressors off [**3-5**]
   - hemodynamics stable
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG/NSTEMI: pt is currently denying CP, EKGs at baseline.
   CK/MB flat and troponin continues to trend down from max of 30 during
   prior admission, continue to follow
   - continue Aspirin 325mg & Plavix 75mg daily
   - hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # ESRD on PD: renal following, plan for PD, peritonitis, see above
   - PD cath Cx
 no organisms seen on gram stain
   - f/u renal recs, did stop renagel due to its constipating effects
   - continue Calcitriol
   - will reculture fluid
   - added epo per renal recs
   .
   # Ureteral stent
 urology consulted for hyperdense finding in CT scan,
   thought to possibly be blood.  Urology reviewed scan and did not think
   any intervention at this time was needed, especially in setting of this
   infection.
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct in low 30s, down to 23 with IVF.  Now concern
   for lower GI bleed given colitis and dark stool, though guaic negative
   on exam.
   - type & cross; continue to guiac stools
   - CVL and PIV for access
   - PPI & trend hct, keep > 21
   .
   # Metastatic Carcinoid: Pt with known liver mets followed by hem/onc
   with apparent worsening disease on CT
   - f/u hem/onc as outpt
   .
   # FEN: on bowel rest, today will do PPN and tomorrow plan for TPN as
   LFTs start to improve
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin sc tid, PPI IV

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and myocardial infarction (MI), metastatic carcinoid, chronic abdominal/back pain, who presents with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension. He was found to have colitis on CT scan and is now experiencing ileus/SBO. 

The patient has been diagnosed with presumptive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, which has been complicated by what appears to be ileus, although small bowel obstruction (SBO) is still a possibility. The patient has been treated with Zosyn for possible diverticulitis, oral Flagyl and IV vancomycin for possible C. diff colitis, and c. diff toxin negative but still likely the cause. 

The patient's condition has been further complicated by hypotension, which resolved after starting pressors. He also has altered mental status, waxing and waning, possibly baseline or due to uremia versus narcotic usage. 

Other comorbidities and conditions mentioned in the note include end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis (ESRD on PD), ureteral stent, anemia, metastatic carcinoid, and previous CABG/NSTEMI. 

The patient has expressed goals of care to avoid heroic measures, confirmed by his healthcare proxy."

   fevers at home but pt reports subjective chills. WBC ct of 20 and CT
   with colitis.  Concern for C Diff colitis vs ischemic colitis,
   complicated by sepsis
 requiring pressor support.  SBP also possible,
   had high WBC count but no organisms grew.  Pt was seen by gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] and
   vasc surgery in ED, no plan for OR.  Pt expressed goals of care to
   avoid heroic measures, confirmed by HCP. [**Name (NI) 53**] on contact
   precautions.  C.diff has been complicated by what appears to be ileus,
   probably not SBO as pt is having bowel movements, has normal bowel
   sounds and no severe belly pain.
   - IV vanco for peritonitis (see below)
   - Zozyn for possible diverticulitis, will complete a 10 day course, no
   day [**7-30**]
   - Flagyl and po Vanc for possible CDiff colitis, plan to treat for 2
   weeks after course of vanco/zosyn completed
   - c.diff toxin negative, but still is likely the cause
   - pt with likely ileus, continuing to have bowel movements; keep on
   bowel rest for now, continue to monitor with occasional KUBs, follow up
   with surgery about plans for advancing diet
   - holding narcotics, seems comfortable
   # peritonitis
 spoke to renal today, should give vanc for the full two
   week course, and will check peritoneal fluid again, they will continue
   PD through this infection.
   - vanc dosing should be 750 mg when daily vanco level is below 15; cont
   checking daily vanc levels

   # Hypotension:  Resolved, patient is severe vasculopath and pressures
   are difficult to determine. Patient was initially started on levo and
   then moved to three pressors. He has bilateral subclavian stenosis with
   difficult time to determine blood pressure, weaned to mental status as
   well as blood pressures from legs. CT ruled out ruptured AAA and stool
   guaic was negative.   Differential includes sepsis, hypovolemic, GI
   bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely to be MI or adrenal
   insufficiency.  Most likely is sepsis in setting of colitis and
   peritonitis. Pressors off [**3-5**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI), metastatic carcinoid, and chronic abdominal/back pain. The patient presents with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension. He was found to have colitis on CT and is now suspected to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis versus ischemic colitis, complicated by sepsis requiring pressor support. 

The patient's goals of care are to avoid heroic measures, and he is currently on contact precautions for C. diff. He has been treated with vancomycin for peritonitis and piperacillin-tazobactam for possible diverticulitis. The patient's ileus has been complicated by what appears to be an ileus, but he is still having bowel movements and has normal bowel sounds without severe belly pain.

The patient's altered mental status is waxing and waning, possibly baseline or due to uremia versus narcotic usage. His hypotension has resolved, but he has a history of severe vasculopathy and difficult-to-determine blood pressures. The differential includes sepsis, hypovolemic shock, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, ischemic colitis, less likely to be MI or adrenal insufficiency. Most likely, it is sepsis in the setting"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic renal failure and hypothermia. The patient has been on bowel rest and has had several small bowel movements during the day. Potassium levels were replaced per renal recommendations, and the patient tolerated pain without the need for narcotics. The patient called out but did not receive a bed.

Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTHERMIA: The patient is experiencing low body temperature, which may be a result of their chronic condition or other underlying factors. This condition requires immediate attention to prevent further complications.
2. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which could indicate inadequate perfusion and potential organ damage if not addressed promptly.
3. CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient has a pre-existing chronic renal failure, and it is important to monitor their kidney function closely to prevent further deterioration.
4. PAIN CONTROL: The patient requires effective pain management to ensure comfort and prevent any additional complications related to uncontrolled pain.
5. OTHER LAB ABNORMALITIES: The patient has several lab abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, abnormal liver function tests, and abnormal kidney function tests. These abnormalities need to be addressed and managed appropriately to prevent further complications.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   78 y/o M with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG & MI, Metastatic Carcinoid and
   chronic abd/back pain who presents with decreased po intake, diarrhea,
   lethargy and hypotension found to have colitis on CT. Now with
   ileus/SBO.
   .
   # presumptive Cdiff
 Presenation was 2-3 days of dark loose stools and
   poor po intake after completing a course of Abx for PNA. Per family, no
   fevers at home but pt reports subjective chills. WBC ct of 20 and CT
   with colitis.  Concern for C Diff colitis vs ischemic colitis,
   complicated by sepsis
 requiring pressor support.  SBP also possible,
   had high WBC count but no organisms grew.  Pt was seen by gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] and
   vasc surgery in ED, no plan for OR.  Pt expressed goals of care to
   avoid heroic measures, confirmed by HCP. [**Name (NI) 53**] on contact
   precautions.  C.diff has been complicated by what appears to be ileus,
   although SBO is still a possibility.
   - Zozyn for possible diverticulitis, will complete a 10 day course, no
   day [**7-30**]
   - Flagyl and po Vanc and IV vanco for possible CDiff colitis
   - c.diff toxin negative, but still is likely the cause
   - pt with likely ileus, but had bowel movement yesterday
 gen [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   reconsulted and following again.  Will keep NGT on intermittent wall
   suction, remains NPO for bowel rest, continue bowel regimen and
   consider PO narcan as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI), metastatic carcinoid, and chronic abdominal/back pain. He presented with decreased oral intake, diarrhea, lethargy, and hypotension, and was found to have colitis on CT. The patient has been diagnosed with presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and is currently being treated with Zosyn, Flagyl, and IV vancomycin. He also has ileus/SBO, and there is concern for sepsis due to high white blood cell count. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the high white blood cell count and presence of colitis, there is a concern for sepsis. The patient is already on multiple antibiotics for presumed C. diff colitis, which is appropriate.
2. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's symptoms could also be due to ischemic colitis, especially considering his history of vascular disease. Further evaluation may be needed to differentiate between C. diff colitis and ischemic colitis.
3. Peritonitis: The patient's peritoneal fluid is being checked again due to the possibility of peritonitis, especially since he is on peritoneal dialysis (PD).
