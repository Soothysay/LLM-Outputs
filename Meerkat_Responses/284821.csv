   74M admitted yesterday with worsening SOB. Over the course of [**2127**], his
   dyspnea and O2 needs have worsened. He has been on prednisone since
   [**4-3**] which were increased when he became acutely ill in Novemebr.
   Over past 2 weeks, his SOB has worsened and he was admitted 2 days ago.
   He has required wither 50% FM or BiPAP. His CXR was interpreted as
   showing a new pnemonia. He was covered with levoflox and given
   solumedrol.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted with worsening shortness of breath (SOB). He has been on prednisone since April 3rd, which were increased when he became acutely ill in November. The patient's SOB has worsened over the past two weeks, leading to his current admission. He requires either 50% FiO2 or BiPAP for respiratory support. A chest X-ray revealed new pneumonia, and he was covered with levofloxacin and given solumedrol.

The patient has a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) diagnosed three years ago, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exposure to cement dust in 2024, potential remote asbestos exposure, coronary artery disease (CAD) with stent placement in 2015, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) endograft repair in 2024, hypertension (HTN), and weight loss.

On review of systems, the patient reports dyspnea and constitutional symptoms including weight loss. His vital signs show a heart rate of 79-84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136-144/78-94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22-38 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on non-rebreather mask with BiPAP, and temperature within normal range.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, no acute distress, and normal cardiovascular"

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath. He has a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) diagnosed 3 years ago, COPD, cement dust exposure, possible remote asbestos exposure, CAD stent in 2005, AAA endograft repair in 2014, and hypertension. The patient's dyspnea and oxygenation have worsened despite being on prednisone since 04-03 and experiencing a response in 05/2019 and 09/2019. His steroids have been weaned over the past month, leading to a decline in his symptoms. The patient's current condition includes mild respiratory distress at rest, crackles bilaterally on chest examination, and right lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Imaging studies reveal usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) consistent with IPF and a chest X-ray from the previous day showing new infiltrates. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis indicates hypoxemia. The patient's assessment and plan include persistent hypoxemia with possible new infiltrates, possibilities including IPF flare, pneumonia, or congestive heart failure, with a current favoring IPF flare. The patient will continue with steroids and antibiotics, and a CT angiogram will be obtained. Other conditions such as CAD will continue with outpatient reg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of IPF, COPD, and tobacco use. He presents with hypoxia and has been transferred for further management. The patient requires a high level of oxygen and experiences desaturation with mild movements. His physical exam does not suggest a COPD exacerbation or CHF exacerbation. There are concerns about a possible bacterial process, and he is currently on day 2 of levofloxacin. The patient describes low-grade temperatures, weight loss, and night sweats, and given his chronic steroid use, there is a consideration for PCP or less likely TB. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's need for high levels of oxygen and desaturation with mild movements indicate respiratory distress. This could be due to an acute exacerbation of his underlying chronic lung disease (COPD), progression of IPF, or a superimposed pneumonia.
2. Potential Bacterial Process: The patient is on day 2 of levofloxacin, which suggests an ongoing concern for a bacterial infection. The low-grade temperatures, weight loss, and night sweats could be signs of an infection.
3. Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP) or Tuberculosis (TB): Given the patient's chronic steroid use and symptoms such as low-grade temperatures, weight loss, and night sweats, there is a consideration for PCP or less"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute on chronic respiratory failure. They have been requiring mask ventilation and experiencing desats with any activity. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/70 to 144/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is receiving non-rebreather oxygen and CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 set at 100%. An arterial blood gas analysis shows pH levels at 23, indicating acidosis. The patient has received a total of 200 mL of fluid intake and 250 mL of fluid output over the past 24 hours. They have a history of well-nourished appearance, crackles and wheezing breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological assessment is incomplete. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, while other values are within normal range. The patient has been admitted with a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing need for mask ventilation and low oxygen saturation indicate severe respiratory distress. Without adequate respiratory support, the patient may experience further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). He was admitted with acute on chronic respiratory failure and has been requiring mask ventilation with brief periods of rest. The patient is experiencing significant FiO2 requirements, significant dyspnea with any form of activity, and acute worsening of IPF versus infectious versus congestive heart failure (CHF). The clinician suspects IPF worsening but needs to evaluate and empirically treat alternate etiologies due to the limited effectiveness of therapies for IPF.

Assessment and Plan:
- Obtain CT-A chest to better evaluate the parenchyma and rule out pulmonary embolism (PE).
- Send micro incisions for sputum culture and influenza testing.
- Empiric antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and bactrim IV for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), given the patient's recent steroid use.
- Less likely for CHF but will closely monitor fluid balance, especially while on IV bactrim.
- Considerations for possible pulmonary rehabilitation and physical therapy due to the patient's weight loss, low-grade temperature, and night sweats.
- Check with primary care physician (PCP) regarding placement of PPD.

Medical Complications:

1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition is worsening, requiring mask ventilation and significant"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), and tobacco use. He presents with hypoxia and is being managed in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). 

The differential diagnosis for his hypoxia includes acute flare of chronic IPF, COPD exacerbation, or a superimposed infectious process on his underlying chronic lung disease. The physical exam does not suggest a COPD exacerbation or CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) exacerbation. 

The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures, weight loss, and night sweats, which may raise suspicion for PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) or TB (Tuberculosis), especially considering his chronic steroid use. A CT scan shows marked progression of IPF since 2014, with diffuse ground glass opacities, awaiting final read. 

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/cefepine) for HAP (Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia), atypical coverage (Levo), and empiric treatment for PCP (Bactrim). Induced sputum is not tolerated due to hypoxia. DFA (Direct Fluorescent Antibody) testing is negative for viral infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxia, and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CT scan. The patient's condition has been worsening, with increasing oxygen requirements and the need for CPAP/BiPAP support. Despite these measures, the patient continues to experience hypoxia and fatigue. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 115/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 82%. The patient's weight remains at 68.2 kg, and fluid balance shows a net intake of 1,640 mL and output of 1,625 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including broad-spectrum antibiotics (bactrim), Lasix, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Microbiology testing for respiratory viral antigen screen was negative. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and disposition is ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of CPAP/BiPAP support increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of asthma, COPD, and IPF who was transferred to the ICU with acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient continues to require mask ventilation with brief periods of rest and has significant FiO2 requirements. The patient also experiences dyspnea with any form of activity. The acute worsening of IPF versus infectious versus CHF is suspected, but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 120/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on BiPAP. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted worsening of respiratory symptoms. 

The physical examination reveals crackles on lung auscultation and normal bowel sounds. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M h/o asthma, COPD, IPF, transferred with acute on chronic
   respiratory failure for further evaluation

 Acute on chronic resp failure
   -Presumed due to IPF flare
   -cont to require mask ventilation with decreasing tolerance of periods
   off
   -cont with maxed FiO2 requirement with borderline sats
   -sig dyspnea with any form of activity (eg. writing messages)
   -Treating for potential alternate reversible etiologies given paucity
   of effective therapies for IPF
   -empiric abx vs. HAP and PCP (given on steroids with recent taper)
   until able to exclude infectious agents and narrow regimen.
   -less going for CHF but follow balance closely especially while on IV
   Bactrim given large fluid load
   -had negative PPD at PCP per report

 IPF
   -Followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Hospital1 **].  Dx via CT imaging and presentation
   c/w IPF,
   -Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 453**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] saw pt last night
 felt most c/w IPF flare and
   nothing to offer in terms of alternate therapies for IPF including
   trial enrollment or compassionate use
COPD
   - cont nebs
 CAD:
   - Stent in [**2125**].
   - cont ASA, atenolol, cont plavix and statin
Above communicated with family.  They are contemplating taking pt home
   on hospice as he would like to pass away at home.  They understand
   there is a significant chance of patient passing away en route or
   shortly after arrival.  Given his tenuous saturation on maximal FiO2 he
   could rapidly decompensate
   For remainder of plan, please see resident notes.

   Patient is critically ill.
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of asthma, COPD, and IPF, who was admitted with acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient continues to require mask ventilation with decreasing tolerance for periods off, and has a maximum FiO2 requirement with borderline oxygen saturation levels. The patient experiences significant dyspnea with any form of activity. 

The assessment and plan include treating for potential alternate reversible etiologies given the lack of effective therapies for IPF. Empiric antibiotics are being given for HAP and PCP, especially since the patient is on steroids with a recent taper. Less likely causes such as CHF are being monitored closely, especially while on IV Bactrim due to the large fluid load. The patient had a negative PPD at PCP per report. 

The patient's IPF is being followed by Dr. [First Name4 (NamePattern1)] at [Hospital1], diagnosed via CT imaging and presentation consistent with IPF. Dr. [First Name4 (NamePattern1) 453] [Last Name (NamePattern1)] saw the patient last night and felt that most of the patient's symptoms were due to an IPF flare, with nothing to offer in terms of alternate therapies for IPF including trial enrollment or compassionate use. 

The patient's COPD is being managed with nebulizers. The patient has a history of CAD, with a stent in [2125]. The patient is currently on ASA,"
