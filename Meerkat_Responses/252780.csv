   of possible effusion, no clear consolidation
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated overnight for increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated earlier this morning for increased
   work of breathing
oxygen saturation and CXR were not markedly changed.
   Currently on AC 450/14/5 with 100% oxygen.
   - Sending repeat gas to assess for need to change vent settings now
   that patient is intubated and wean FiO2 as permitted.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Continue very aggressive IVF resuscitation with 1 L NS boluses, will
   monitor tachycardia, laboratory values to assess adequacy of
   resuscitation; using LR and NS based on chloride, acid-base status,
   potassium/renal function.
   - Central line replaced.
   - Correcting hypocalcemia, calcium gtt, monitoring Q6H.
   - On Zosyn to empirically cover for gram negative pathogens (as
   discussed below).
   - NPO for bowel rest, will consider possibily initiating tube feeds.
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   - Will monitor on CIWA scale, prior to intubation, the importance of
   refraining from alcohol in setting of pancreatitis was stressed.
   .
   #) Acidosis: Patient had had initial bicarbonate of 13 (with normal
   renal function, which was likely due to her renal failure and profound
   hypovolemia from third spacing of fluids, but cannot rule out other
   etiologies as her HCO3 was low prior to her renal insufficiency).
   - Bicarb improved this morning, however patient more acidotic on ABG.
   Will follow up AM ABG post intubation and re-assess as needed.
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia: Patient with marked hypocalcemia, likely due to
   precipitation of calcium in pancreatic bed with fluid sequestration
   into third space. Improving with repletion and hydration.
   - Continue to repleat aggressively, checking Q6H, IV calcium.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved.
   - Hepatitis serologies pending.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn started given concern for possible infection in setting of
   relative hypotension and bandemia.
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   #) Gram positive cocci in blood cultures: [**Month (only) 51**] be contaminant or could
   represent superimposed infection. Vancomycin started (day 1 [**10-27**]).
   -          Monitoring all cx data (including from [**Hospital3 **])
   -          Continue vanco until further speciated.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation,
   was likely [**3-6**] to 3^rd spacing of fluids and resultant intravascular
   fluid depletion.
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI (NPO)
   .
   #) FEN: NPO, repleting electrolytes as needed. Will discuss TFs,
   aggressive IVFs as noted above.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Mom [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2017**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient underwent percutaneous drain placement and was intubated overnight for increased work of breathing. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has suspected pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. It is important to monitor her clinical condition and laboratory values closely for any signs of complications such as infection or organ dysfunction.

3. Sepsis: The patient has gram-positive cocci in her blood cultures, which could indicate a possible infection. Monitoring of all culture data and continued empiric coverage with antibiotics is essential to prevent and treat sepsis.

4. Acute kidney injury: The patient had initial renal failure but has since resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Continued monitoring of renal function is crucial, especially during ongoing fluid management.

5. Hypocalcemia: The patient has marked hypocalcemia, likely due to precipitation of calcium in the pancreatic bed with fluid sequestration. Repletion of calcium and close monitoring are necessary to correct and prevent further complications related"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated overnight for increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated earlier this morning for increased
   work of breathing
oxygen saturation and CXR were not markedly changed.
   Currently on AC 450/14/5 with 100% oxygen.
   - Sending repeat gas to assess for need to change vent settings now
   that patient is intubated and wean FiO2 as permitted.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Continue very aggressive IVF resuscitation with 1 L NS boluses, will
   monitor tachycardia, laboratory values to assess adequacy of
   resuscitation; using LR and NS based on chloride, acid-base status,
   potassium/renal function.
   - Central line replaced.
   - Correcting hypocalcemia, calcium gtt, monitoring Q6H.
   - On Zosyn to empirically cover for gram negative pathogens (as
   discussed below).
   - NPO for bowel rest, will consider possibily initiating tube feeds.
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   - Will monitor on CIWA scale, prior to intubation, the importance of
   refraining from alcohol in setting of pancreatitis was stressed.
   .
   #) Acidosis: Patient had had initial bicarbonate of 13 (with normal
   renal function, which was likely due to her renal failure and profound
   hypovolemia from third spacing of fluids, but cannot rule out other
   etiologies as her HCO3 was low prior to her renal insufficiency).
   - Bicarb improved this morning, however patient more acidotic on ABG.
   Will follow up AM ABG post intubation and re-assess as needed.
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia: Patient with marked hypocalcemia, likely due to
   precipitation of calcium in pancreatic bed with fluid sequestration
   into third space. Improving with repletion and hydration.
   - Continue to repleat aggressively, checking Q6H, IV calcium.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved.
   - Hepatitis serologies pending.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn started given concern for possible infection in setting of
   relative hypotension and bandemia.
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   #) Gram positive cocci in blood cultures: [**Month (only) 51**] be contaminant or could
   represent superimposed infection. Vancomycin started (day 1 [**10-27**]).
   -          Monitoring all cx data (including from [**Hospital3 **])
   -          Continue vanco until further speciated.

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She underwent percutaneous drain placement and was intubated overnight for increased work of breathing. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pancreatitis, suspected secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use, possible gallstone passage, EtOH abuse, acidosis, hypocalcemia, elevated liver function tests, distended and thickened gallbladder, gram-positive cocci in blood cultures, acute renal failure, GERD, and pneumoboots.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated due to increased work of breathing, indicating respiratory distress. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has ongoing pancreatitis, which can lead to local complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation. Systemic complications may include multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or sepsis if there is infection.

3. Gallbladder issues: The patient has a distended and thickened gallbladder. This could be due to acalculous cholecystitis or secondary to edema and irritation of the pancreas. There is a risk of gallbladder perforation or"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated overnight for increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated earlier this morning for increased
   work of breathing
oxygen saturation and CXR were not markedly changed.
   Suspect etiology was both due to discomfort of abdominal distension
   (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload, and possibly
   beginnings of [**Month/Year (2) 509**] (although no infiltrates on chest x-ray).  Currently
   on AC 450/14/5 with 100% oxygen.
   -          Repeat ABG demonstrated acidosis (7.23) with CO2 51, O2 159,
   and patient is currently breathing at rate of 22 with slightly larger
   volumes.  Given potential for [**Last Name (LF) 509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] leave minute ventilation at
   current setting and increase rate to 22, PEEP to 8, and decrease Fi02
   to 80% to see if her oxygenation remains stable to improved. She still
   has a large A-a gradient, which is why development of [**First Name3 (LF) 509**] could be
   possible.
   -          Will increase flow to help with any degree of air hunger
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Continue very aggressive IVF resuscitation with 1 L NS boluses, will
   monitor tachycardia, laboratory values to assess adequacy of
   resuscitation; using LR and NS based on chloride, acid-base status,
   potassium/renal function. Main value today will be urine output
will
   bolus if drops below 50cc/hr.
   - Central line replaced.
   - Correcting hypocalcemia, calcium gtt, monitoring Q6H.
   - On Zosyn to empirically cover for gram negative pathogens (as
   discussed below).
   - NPO for bowel rest, will consider possibily initiating tube feeds
   (will discuss with surgery today initiating post-pyloric feedings).
   - Sepsis and [**First Name3 (LF) 509**] risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place, stomach decompressed yesterday.
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Will monitor on CIWA scale, prior to intubation, the
   importance of refraining from alcohol in setting of pancreatitis was
   stressed prior to intubation.
   -          Current tachycardia and hypertension (SBP now 130-160) may
   be due to withdrawal
will give trial of versed to see if this helps and
   then consider increasing sedation or boluses as needed.
   .
   #) Acidosis: Patient had had initial bicarbonate of 13 (with normal
   renal function, which was likely due to her renal failure and profound
   hypovolemia from third spacing of fluids, but cannot rule out other
   etiologies as her HCO3 was low prior to her renal insufficiency).
   Currently her acidosis is mixed from both respiratory and metabolic
   state.
   - Continuing IVFs to correct metabolic abnormalities, will continue to
   adjust ventilator to work on acid-base status as well.
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia: Patient with marked hypocalcemia, likely due to
   precipitation of calcium in pancreatic bed with fluid sequestration
   into third space. Improving with repletion and hydration.
   - Continue to repleat aggressively, checking Q6H, IV calcium.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)

   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Will discuss with surgery team if additional imaging (and which
   modality
MRI vs CT w/contrast) would be of assistance given her
   distended abdomen, worsening clinical status.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn started given concern for possible infection in setting of
   relative hypotension and bandemia.
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   #) Gram positive cocci in blood cultures: [**Month (only) 51**] be contaminant or could

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation earlier this morning for increased work of breathing. Oxygen saturation and chest x-ray were not markedly changed. The etiology is suspected to be due to discomfort from abdominal distension, volume overload, and possible early stages of ARDS. The patient is currently on assist-control ventilation with 100% oxygen.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient is suspected to have pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. There is also a possibility that the patient passed a stone given the dilated common bile duct.

3. Acidosis: The patient initially had a bicarbonate level of 13, which was likely due to renal failure and profound hypovolemia. Currently, her acidosis is mixed from both respiratory and metabolic causes.

4. Hypocalcemia: The patient has marked hypocalcemia, likely due to precipitation of calcium in the pancreatic bed with fluid sequestration into the third space. Her calcium levels are improving with repletion and hydration.

5. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient had markedly elevated AST (800"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's medical history is limited due to sedation, and no allergies have been reported. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and stable blood pressure. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100% and PIP of 27 cmH2O. Fluid balance shows an input of 7,020 mL and output of 1,915 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine. Blood cultures from Hospital 1 are pending. The patient's most recent CXR shows increased haziness at both lung bases and blunting of the costophrenic angle, suggesting possible effusion but no consolidation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and positive blood cultures indicate a potential bacterial infection. The presence of haziness in the lung bases on the CXR could suggest pneumonia or effusion, which may be related to the infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. This could be due to various factors, including sepsis, dehydration, or medication toxicity.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. If"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The note indicates that the patient's blood cultures were drawn on [**2162-10-28**] at 09:09 PM. The patient's ventilator settings were adjusted, and they are now tolerating an ABG of 7.40. The patient's tachycardia improved with increased doses of versed (10) and fentanyl (200). A nutrition consult for TPN recommendations was ordered. The patient has cloudy, blood-tinged urine, and a urinalysis was ordered, revealing 15 WBCs and a few bacteria. The patient received a bolus of 500cc LR due to low urine output (<50cc) for two hours, again at 1 AM. The patient's temperature rose to 101 degrees Fahrenheit at midnight, and blood and bile cultures were recultured. Zosyn was restarted.

The patient's allergies include Piperacillin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (versed). Other ICU medications include Pantoprazole (Protonix) started on [**2162-10-28**] at 09:50 AM, and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) started on [**2162-10-29**] at 12:00 AM. 

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, a current temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/62 mmHg to 163/138 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating an intake of 3,092 mL and an output of 2,450 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a ventilator set at a volume of 450 mL, a rate of 22 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 97%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, HCO3 of 107 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation of 214.

The patient's physical examination is largely unassessed, with no information provided for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments, and others. The lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 18.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.5 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) at 188 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated yesterday ([**10-28**]) for increased work
   of breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently on AC 450/22/8 with 50% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. No infiltrates on CXR to suggest ARDS.
          -      Last ABG demonstrated adequate settings: 7.4/37/107/24
   with lactate 0.5.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Continue very aggressive IVF resuscitation with [**Telephone/Fax (1) 179**] cc LR
   boluses, will monitor tachycardia, laboratory values to assess adequacy
   of resuscitation; using LR and NS based on chloride, acid-base status,
   potassium/renal function. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2132**] PRN UOP <50.
   - Central line replaced.
   - Correcting hypocalcemia, calcium gtt, monitoring [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Given lower HCT, mindful of possible transition to hemorrhage
   pancreatitis. Monitoring PM HCT. Abx as noted below.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated today.
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   .
   #) Fevers: Overnight with fever to 101. Given that this after his Zosyn
   had been stopped, and high risk bacteremia from gut translocation.
   Concern also remains for possible cholangitis, although this has felt
   to be less likely.
   - Will re-start Zosyn today, continue to monitor all culture data.
   [**Hospital3 735**] confirmed that all culture data negative to date as of
   today. Patient re-cultured overnight.
   - Will continue to discuss with surgery when/if any repeat imaging
   would be of use.
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Yesterday, tachycardia and hypertension may have been
   secondary to withdrawal
improved with trial of versed [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   continuing increased dosing as needed.
   .
   #) Acidosis: Resolved
bicarb has returned to [**Location 810**], as has pH on ABG.
   Initially had initial bicarbonate of 13 (with normal renal function,
   which was likely due to her renal failure and profound hypovolemia from
   third spacing of fluids, but cannot rule out other etiologies as her
   HCO3 was low prior to her renal insufficiency).
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia: Patient with marked hypocalcemia, likely due to
   precipitation of calcium in pancreatic bed with fluid sequestration
   into third space. Improving with repletion and hydration, will continue
   to monitor [**Hospital1 7**].
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Continuing to discuss with surgery if any additional tests or imaging
   needed, none at present, appreciate assistance.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 5).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   #) Bacteremia: Cultures from day of admission grew out enterococci
   faecalis, sensitive to vancomycin which was started on [**10-27**]. Left IJ
   has been removed.
   -          Monitoring all cx data (including from [**Hospital3 **])
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline. Large degree was likely
   dilutional from aggressive IVF resuscitation, however concerning that
   it is continuing to decline, as noted above, transition to hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis is a possibility.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all pending.
   - Re-check PM HCT.
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to discomfort from abdominal distension, volume overload, and possibly ARDS. She has been on AC 450/22/8 with 50% oxygen and appears comfortable. Her last ABG demonstrated adequate ventilator settings. The patient also has suspected pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile, and there is concern for possible bacteremia or infection due to gut translocation. Re-starting Zosyn and monitoring all culture data is appropriate.
3. Hemorrhagic Pancreatitis: The patient's HCT is declining, which could indicate a transition to hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, and DIC labs are pending. Re-checking PM HCT is important.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient has marked hypocalcemia, likely due to precipitation of calcium in the pancreatic bed. Repletion and hydration should continue to monitor calcium levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated overnight for increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated earlier this morning for increased
   work of breathing
oxygen saturation and CXR were not markedly changed.
   Suspect etiology was both due to discomfort of abdominal distension
   (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload, and possibly
   beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest x-ray).  Currently
   on AC 450/11/8 with 50% oxygen.
   -          Last ABG demonstrated adequate settings: 7.4/37/107/24 with
   lactate 0.5.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Continue very aggressive IVF resuscitation with 1 L NS boluses, will
   monitor tachycardia, laboratory values to assess adequacy of
   resuscitation; using LR and NS based on chloride, acid-base status,
   potassium/renal function. Main value today will be urine output
will
   bolus if drops below 50cc/hr.
   - Central line replaced.
   - Correcting hypocalcemia, calcium gtt, monitoring Q6H.
   - On Zosyn to empirically cover for gram negative pathogens (as
   discussed below).
   - NPO for bowel rest, will consider possibily initiating tube feeds
   (will discuss with surgery today initiating post-pyloric feedings).
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place, stomach decompressed yesterday.
   .
   #) Fevers:
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Will monitor on CIWA scale, prior to intubation, the
   importance of refraining from alcohol in setting of pancreatitis was
   stressed prior to intubation.
   -          Current tachycardia and hypertension (SBP now 130-160) may
   be due to withdrawal
will give trial of versed to see if this helps and
   then consider increasing sedation or boluses as needed.
   .
   #) Acidosis: Resolved
bicarb has returned to [**Location 810**], as has pH on ABG.
   Initially had initial bicarbonate of 13 (with normal renal function,
   which was likely due to her renal failure and profound hypovolemia from
   third spacing of fluids, but cannot rule out other etiologies as her
   HCO3 was low prior to her renal insufficiency).
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia: Patient with marked hypocalcemia, likely due to
   precipitation of calcium in pancreatic bed with fluid sequestration
   into third space. Improving with repletion and hydration.
   - Continue to repleat aggressively, checking Q6H, IV calcium.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies pending.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   -Surgery did not feel that any additional imaging was necessary
   yesterday, will discuss again today given fevers overnight.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn started given concern for possible infection in setting of
   relative hypotension and bandemia.
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   #) Bacteremia: Cultures from day of admission grew out enterococci.
   Vancomycin started (day 1 [**10-27**]). Left IJ has been removed.
   -          Monitoring all cx data (including from [**Hospital3 **])
   -          Continue vanco until further speciated.
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation,
   was likely [**3-6**] to 3^rd spacing of fluids and resultant intravascular
   fluid depletion.
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: NPO, repleting electrolytes as needed. Will discuss TFs,
   aggressive IVFs as noted above.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. She underwent percutaneous drain placement and was intubated overnight for increased work of breathing.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing and is currently on assisted ventilation. The etiology of respiratory failure may be related to discomfort from abdominal distension, volume overload, and possible early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's oxygen saturation and chest X-ray did not show significant changes.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient is suspected to have pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. There is also a possibility that the patient could have passed a stone given the dilated common bile duct (CBD).

3. Fevers: The patient developed fevers overnight, and cultures have been ordered. She has a history of alcohol abuse and possible sepsis.

4. EtOH abuse: The patient has a history of significant alcohol consumption. She may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and sedation with versed is being given to manage tachycardia and hypertension, which may be due to withdrawal.

5. Acidosis: The patient initially had metabolic acidosis, but it has resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation and bic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, now with fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of
   breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently on AC 450/22/8 with 50% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. No infiltrates on CXR to suggest ARDS. X-ray today
   as well as CT scan consistent with moderate pleural effusions in
   setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation.
          -      Will decrease FiO2 to 40% given last ABG.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -          Given massively fluid overloaded state (from necessary IVFs
   for pancreatitis), will likely initiate slow diuresis to help improve
   fluid status (goal net negative 500 cc today) for future extubation,
   given that she has not needed IVF boluses and laboratories/hemodynamics
   have been stable as far as pancreatitis is concerned.
   .

   #) Fevers, bacteremia: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of bacteremia from gut
   translocation. CT negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Concern also remains for possible cholangitis, although this has felt
   to be less likely. Med effect also possibility (new med would be zosyn,
   versed, fentanyl)
   - Continue zosyn and vancomycin (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin [**10-28**]).
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites).
   - Re-culture bile.

   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well. Yesterday T.
   Bili and direct bili were elevated which was concerning for worsening
   abdominal process, but they have improved today. Alk phos still high
   though. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.

   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She is currently intubated for respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing, possibly secondary to discomfort from abdominal distension, volume overload, and ARDS. The patient has been febrile since [Date range (1) 2161] and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected bacteremia. Imaging shows moderate pleural effusions, increased ascites, peripancreatic stranding and inflammation, and a possibly mildly inflamed appendix. There is no evidence of abscess, hemorrhage, or bowel pathology. The patient's LFTs are elevated, likely due to alcoholic hepatitis, and her gallbladder appears distended and thickened.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The main concern here is extubation and weaning off the ventilator. The patient needs to improve her respiratory function and fluid status to attempt extubation.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which is likely secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. She will require further management of her pancreatitis, including aggressive IV fluids, pain control, and nutritional support.

3. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient has had persistent fevers since [Date range"

   secondary to proximity to fluid.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated yesterday ([**10-28**]) for increased work
   of breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently on AC 450/22/8 with 50% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. No infiltrates on CXR to suggest ARDS.
          -      Last ABG demonstrated adequate settings: 7.4/37/107/24
   with lactate 0.5.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Continue very aggressive IVF resuscitation with [**Telephone/Fax (1) 179**] cc LR
   boluses, will monitor tachycardia, laboratory values to assess adequacy
   of resuscitation; using LR and NS based on chloride, acid-base status,
   potassium/renal function. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2132**] PRN UOP <50.
   - Central line replaced.
   - Correcting hypocalcemia, calcium gtt, monitoring [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Given lower HCT, mindful of possible transition to hemorrhage
   pancreatitis. Monitoring PM HCT. Abx as noted below.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated today.
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   .
   #) Fevers: Overnight with fever to 101. Given that this after his Zosyn
   had been stopped, and high risk bacteremia from gut translocation.
   Concern also remains for possible cholangitis, although this has felt
   to be less likely.
   - Will re-start Zosyn today, continue to monitor all culture data.
   [**Hospital3 735**] confirmed that all culture data negative to date as of
   today. Patient re-cultured overnight.
   - Will continue to discuss with surgery when/if any repeat imaging
   would be of use.
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Yesterday, tachycardia and hypertension may have been
   secondary to withdrawal
improved with trial of versed [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   continuing increased dosing as needed.
   .
   #) Acidosis: Resolved
bicarb has returned to [**Location 810**], as has pH on ABG.
   Initially had initial bicarbonate of 13 (with normal renal function,
   which was likely due to her renal failure and profound hypovolemia from
   third spacing of fluids, but cannot rule out other etiologies as her
   HCO3 was low prior to her renal insufficiency).
   .
   #) Hypocalcemia: Patient with marked hypocalcemia, likely due to
   precipitation of calcium in pancreatic bed with fluid sequestration
   into third space. Improving with repletion and hydration, will continue
   to monitor [**Hospital1 7**].
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Continuing to discuss with surgery if any additional tests or imaging
   needed, none at present, appreciate assistance.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 5).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   #) Bacteremia: Cultures from day of admission grew out enterococci
   faecalis, sensitive to vancomycin which was started on [**10-27**]. Left IJ
   has been removed.
   -          Monitoring all cx data (including from [**Hospital3 **])
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline. Large degree was likely
   dilutional from aggressive IVF resuscitation, however concerning that
   it is continuing to decline, as noted above, transition to hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis is a possibility.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all pending.
   - Re-check PM HCT.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 y/o F w/hx of pancreatitis who presents with severe acute
   pancreatitis, ? cholangitis/choledocholithiasis and acute renal
   failure.
   1. Pancreatitis:  Required less fluid yesterday, maintaining good urine
   output, CVP currently 16, evidence of anasarca on recent CT
    - will start gradual diuresis (aim for
 500 cc today)
    - appreciate surgery input
    - monitor bladder pressures
   2. Volume overload: bilateral pleural effusions with abdominal ascites
   in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   given pancreatitis appears to be improving, abd CT no necrosis/abscess,
   electrolytes within normal limits, uop stable, pressures stable,
   therefore will start gentle diuresis
    - lasix 10 mg IV for goal net negative
   3. Gallbladder disease: ? cholangitis, bilis came up a bit yesterday,
   now having fevers through zosyn, biliary drain continues to drain bile.
    - will contact [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
    - t/b with surgery regarding plan for drain
    -contt vanc/zosyn
   2. Fever:  Febrile to 101 overnight.  Blood cx from admission growing
   enterococcus, but negative since then.  Initially febrile after d/c
   zosyn, however continues to have temp after zosyn has been added back.
   Reimaging does not reveal abscess or obvious source of infection.
    - urine, bile, sputum, blood culture
    - [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 2160**] [**Last Name (un) 270**] to vanc
    - low threshold tap abd if fevers persist
    - cont vanc/zosyn and check vanc trough
   3. Respiratory failure:  Likely ARDS due to underlying pancreatitis,
   with difficulty keeping up with her minute ventilation due to abdominal
   distention, now + bilateral pleural effusions likely increasing wob.
   ABG improved with increase in respiratory rate.
    - will initiate diuresis, and cont to assess on ventilator, with
   diuresis and decrease in size of effusions may be able to progress on
   vent
   4. ETOH withdrawal: requiring heavy sedation dosing, likely [**3-6**] prior
   use
   5. Respiratory
   - continue low tidal volume and decrease FIO2 to 40%
   6. ARF: Resolved.
   5. Anemia:  28 this morning.  Likely related to volume resuscitation,
   less likely hemorrhagic pancreatitis, and no evidence of this on abd
   CT.  Fibrinogen and haptoglobin elevated and less likely DIC

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis appears to be improving, with good urine output and a stable central venous pressure (CVP). However, there is evidence of anasarca on recent CT. A gradual diuresis is planned, aiming for 500 cc today, with monitoring of bladder pressures.
2. Volume overload: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions and abdominal ascites, which may be related to the aggressive diuresis. Gentle diuresis is being started, with a goal net negative fluid balance.
3. Gallbladder disease: The patient may have cholangitis, as evidenced by the presence of bile in the drain. Culture data from the bile is pending, and the plan is to consult with surgery regarding the management of the drain.
4. Fever: The patient continues to have fevers, despite being on vancomycin and Zosyn. Blood cultures have been obtained, and imaging does not reveal any abscess or obvious source of infection. Low threshold tapping of the abdomen is planned if fevers persist.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has acute respiratory distress"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 y/o F w/hx of pancreatitis who presents with severe acute
   pancreatitis, ? cholangitis/choledocholithiasis and acute renal
   failure.
   1. Pancreatitis:  Required less fluid yesterday, maintaining good urine
   output, CVP currently 16, evidence of anasarca on recent CT
    - will start gradual diuresis (aim for
 500 cc today)
    - appreciate surgery input
    - monitor bladder pressures
   2. Volume overload: bilateral pleural effusions with abdominal ascites
   in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   given pancreatitis appears to be improving, abd CT no necrosis/abscess,
   electrolytes within normal limits, uop stable, pressures stable,
   therefore will start gentle diuresis
    - lasix 10 mg IV for goal net negative
   3. Gallbladder disease: ? cholangitis, bilis came up a bit yesterday,
   now having fevers through zosyn, biliary drain continues to drain bile.
    - will contact [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
    - t/b with surgery regarding plan for drain
    -contt vanc/zosyn
   2. Fever:  Febrile to 101 overnight.  Blood cx from admission growing
   enterococcus, but negative since then.  Initially febrile after d/c
   zosyn, however continues to have temp after zosyn has been added back.
   Reimaging does not reveal abscess or obvious source of infection.
    - urine, bile, sputum, blood culture
    - [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 2160**] [**Last Name (un) 270**] to vanc
    - low threshold tap abd if fevers persist
    - cont vanc/zosyn and check vanc trough
   3. Respiratory failure:  Likely ARDS due to underlying pancreatitis,
   with difficulty keeping up with her minute ventilation due to abdominal
   distention, now + bilateral pleural effusions likely increasing wob.
   ABG improved with increase in respiratory rate.
    - will initiate diuresis, and cont to assess on ventilator, with
   diuresis and decrease in size of effusions may be able to progress on
   vent
   4. ETOH withdrawal: requiring heavy sedation dosing, likely [**3-6**] prior
   use
   5. Respiratory
   - continue low tidal volume and decrease FIO2 to 40%
   6. ARF: Resolved.
   5. Anemia:  28 this morning.  Likely related to volume resuscitation,
   less likely hemorrhagic pancreatitis, and no evidence of this on abd
   CT.  Fibrinogen and haptoglobin elevated and less likely DIC

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, presenting with severe acute pancreatitis, possible cholangitis/choledocholithiasis, and acute renal failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated, requiring heavy sedation dosing. She has shown improvement in her pancreatitis but still has ongoing issues such as volume overload with bilateral pleural effusions and abdominal ascites, fever, respiratory failure likely due to ARDS, ETOH withdrawal, and anemia. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, abscess formation, and systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS).
2. Cholangitis/Choledocholithiasis: The patient's symptoms suggest possible cholangitis or choledocholithiasis, which can cause bile duct obstruction, leading to jaundice, chills, and sepsis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration may occur, requiring dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
4. Volume Overload: The patient's volume overload, evident from bilateral pleural effusions and abdominal ascites, needs to be carefully managed to prevent complications like pulmonary edema or worsening respiratory failure.
5. Respiratory Failure: Due to AR"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 y/o F w/hx of pancreatitis who presents with severe acute
   pancreatitis and acute renal failure.
   1. Pancreatitis:  Required less fluid yesterday, maintaining good urine
   output
    - will start gradual diuresis
    - appreciate surgery input
    - monitor bladder pressures
   2. Volume overload: bilateral pleural effusions with abdominal ascites
   in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   given pancreatitis appears to be improving, abd CT no necrosis/abscess,
   electrolytes within normal limits, uop stable, pressures stable,
   therefore will start gentle diuresis
    - lasix 10 mg IV for goal net negative
   3. Gallbladder: ? cholangitis, bilis came up a bit yesterday, now
   having fevers through zosyn, biliary drain continues to drain bile.
    - will contact [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
    - t/b with surgery regarding plan for drain
    -contt vanc/zosyn
   2. Fever:  Febrile to 101 overnight.  Blood cx from admission growing
   enterococcus, but negative since then.  This is her first fever during
   this hospitalization and occurred in the setting of zosyn being
   discontinued.  She is still having fevers after starting zosyn.
   Reimaging does not reveal abscess.
    - urine, bile, sputum, blood culture
    - [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 2160**] [**Last Name (un) 270**] to vanc
    - low threshold tap abd
   3. Respiratory failure:  Likely ARDS due to underlying pancreatitis,
   with difficulty keeping up with her minute ventilation due to abdominal
   distention, + bilateral pleural effusions likely increasing wob.  ABG
   improved with increase in respiratory rate.
   4. ETOH withdrawal: requiring heavy sedation dosing, likely [**3-6**] prior
   use
   5. Respiratory
   - continue low tidal volume and decrease FIO2 to 40%
   - P:F <200, c/w ARDS, although does not have bilateral infiltrates.
   6. ARF: Resolved.
   5. Anemia:  28 this morning.  Likely related to volume resuscitation
   but she is at risk for hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
   - check DIC labs
   - follow serial Hct; if drops again will reimage her abdomen

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis. She presents with severe acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has had several complications, including volume overload with bilateral pleural effusions and abdominal ascites, suspected cholangitis with bile drainage, fever, and potential alcohol withdrawal. Her respiratory status is improving, but she still requires heavy sedation. Her anemia is likely related to volume resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe acute pancreatitis, which can lead to further complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or hemorrhage.
2. Volume Overload: The patient's volume overload is indicated by the presence of bilateral pleural effusions and abdominal ascites. If not managed properly, it can lead to worsening respiratory distress and cardiovascular instability.
3. Gallbladder Issues: The patient may have cholangitis, as indicated by the presence of bilious output. This condition can progress to cholecystitis or sepsis if not treated promptly.
4. Fever: The patient's fever could be due to an ongoing infection, such as bacterial cholangitis or a hospital-acquired infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, now with fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of
   breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently on AC 450/22/8 with 50% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. No infiltrates on CXR to suggest ARDS. X-ray today
   as well as CT scan consistent with moderate pleural effusions in
   setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation.
          -      Will decrease FiO2 to 40% given last ABG.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -          Given massively fluid overloaded state (from necessary IVFs
   for pancreatitis), initiated diuresis.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD. Calcium, renal function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan completed last night consistent with pancreatitis, no
   hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of bacteremia from gut
   translocation. CT negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Concern also remains for possible cholangitis, although this has felt
   to be less likely. Med effect also possibility (new med would be zosyn,
   versed, fentanyl)
   - Continue zosyn and vancomycin (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin [**10-28**]).
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites).
   - Re-culture bile, pending.
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and
   direct bili were elevated which was concerning for worsening abdominal
   process, but they have improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 6).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   - Follow up final CT read.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline, although today within
   laboratory error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive
   IVF resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - Hct stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: NPO, repleting electrolytes as needed. TPN.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family was in, was updated on progress, all questions
   answered, they will call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, now with fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of
   breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently on AC 450/22/8 with 40% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. No infiltrates on CXR to suggest ARDS. X-ray today
   as well as CT scan consistent with moderate pleural effusions in
   setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation.
          -      Decreased FiO2 to 40% given last ABG; PS trial.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -          Given massively fluid overloaded state (from necessary IVFs
   for pancreatitis), initiated diuresis, continue today goal negative 1 L
   today.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD. Calcium, renal function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of bacteremia from gut
   translocation. CT negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Concern also remains for possible cholangitis, although this has felt
   to be less likely. Med effect also possibility (new med would be zosyn,
   versed, fentanyl)
   - Continue zosyn and vancomycin (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin [**10-28**]).
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites).
   - Re-culture bile, pending.
   - Send c-diff, urine/blood/sputum cx today
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and
   direct bili were elevated which was concerning for worsening abdominal
   process, but they have improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 7).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   - Follow up final CT read.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline, although today within
   laboratory error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive
   IVF resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - Hct stable

   #) Communication: Family was in, was updated on progress, all questions
   answered, they will call anytime with questions. Per patient

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to increased work of breathing. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient develops further lung issues such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has suspected pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. This condition can lead to complications such as infection, necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammation.

3. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient has continued fevers since [Date range (1) 2161]. Culture data has only revealed for enterococcus. There is a high risk of bacteremia from gut translocation, and the patient is at risk for sepsis.

4. Ethanol Abuse: The patient has a history of significant alcohol consumption. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal is necessary, and there is a risk of complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

5. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient had markedly elevated AST greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern. Although the LFTs have improved, there is still a risk of liver damage and complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, now with fevers.
   1) Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of
   breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently improving respiratory status, still on AC, PEEP 8,
   largest compromise likely 2.2 b/l pleural effusions
    - will cont diuresis goal - 1l today
    - attempt PS
   2) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD. Calcium, renal function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan completed last night consistent with pancreatitis, no
   hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   3) cholangitis: surgery following, drain in place, unclear if she had
   infection or was passing stone
   #) Fevers, bacteremia: continues to have low-grade temps now with
   rising white count and bandemia
    - will check cdif
    - will check urine, blood, sputum cultures
    - if negative and continues to have fvrs/wbc, will obtain diagnostic
   tap abd/belly
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, very aggitated when
   sedation lessened
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and
   direct bili were elevated which was concerning for worsening abdominal
   process, but they have improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 6).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   - Follow up final CT read.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline, although today within
   laboratory error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive
   IVF resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   likely [**3-6**] prolonged hosp and volume
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   #) FEN: NPO, repleting electrolytes as needed. TPN.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family was in, was updated on progress, all questions
   answered, they will call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient is currently status-post percutaneous drain and intubated for increased work of breathing. She now has fevers.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she still requires assisted ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 95%. The patient is sedated and responds to commands.

The patient's abdominal distension has improved since the insertion of a nasogastric (NG) tube. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 90 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 123/76 mmHg, and respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.1, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 28.3, platelet (Plt) count of 198,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose level of 140 mg/dL. The liver function tests (LFTs) show an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 800, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 40, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) level of 125, total bilirubin (T Bili) level of 1.0, and direct bilirubin (Dir Bili) level of 0.6 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, hyperlipidemia, and a recent episode of acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also has a history of gallstones, but no stones have been seen on imaging. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, pancreatitis, cholangitis, bacteremia, alcohol abuse, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on assisted ventilation, indicating that she may not be weaned off the ventilator yet. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise due to factors such as volume overload, pleural effusions, or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's abdominal distension has improved, she still requires ongoing management for pancreatitis, including bowel rest, pain control, and close monitoring of laboratory functions.

3. Cholangitis: The patient has a percutaneous drain in place, which was inserted due to concerns of cholangitis. However, the culture results from the drain are negative for bacteria. Further evaluation and management are required to address this condition.

4. Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection indicated by the presence of fevers and a rising white blood cell count. She is already receiving antibiotics, but additional cultures and diagnostic procedures may be necessary to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate treatment.

5. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of significant alcohol consumption, and there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and providing appropriate supportive care are essential.

6. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver function tests, specifically AST and ALT levels, remain elevated. This could be due to alcoholic hepatitis or other underlying liver conditions. Continued monitoring of liver enzymes and addressing any associated complications are necessary.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, now with fevers.
   1) Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of
   breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently improving respiratory status, still on AC, PEEP 8,
   largest compromise likely 2.2 b/l pleural effusions
    - will cont diuresis goal - 1l today
    - attempt PS
   2) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD. Calcium, renal function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan completed last night consistent with pancreatitis, no
   hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - NG tube in place for decompression.

    - will check urine, blood, sputum cultures
    - if negative and continues to have fvrs/wbc, will obtain diagnostic
   tap abd/belly
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, very aggitated when
   sedation lessened
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and
   direct bili were elevated which was concerning for worsening abdominal
   process, but they have improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 6).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   - Follow up final CT read.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She is currently intubated for increased work of breathing due to discomfort from abdominal distension, volume overload, and possibly ARDS. Her respiratory status is improving, but she still requires assisted ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. She has pleural effusions that need to be managed.

The patient also has suspected pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. Her calcium, renal function, UOP, and BP are stable. She is NPO for bowel rest, receiving TPN, and has an NG tube in place for decompression.

She has cholangitis, as determined by surgery, and a drain is in place. There is uncertainty about whether she had an infection or was passing a stone. She has fevers, bacteremia, and a rising white blood cell count with bandemia. Cultures have been obtained, and if negative, a diagnostic tap of the abdomen may be performed.

The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and is being monitored for signs of withdrawal. Her liver function tests show elevated AST (greater than ALT), which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. Imaging shows fatty liver, and her T. Bili and direct bili have improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.

She has a distended"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia.
- She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis.
- She is status-post percutaneous drain and intubated for increased work of breathing.
- The patient has fevers and is suspected to have respiratory failure secondary to discomfort from abdominal distension, volume overload, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- She also has pancreatitis suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use.
- The patient has cholangitis, with a drain in place, and unclear if she had an infection or was passing a stone.
- She has fevers, bacteremia, and rising white blood cell count and bandemia.
- The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
- Her imaging showed fatty liver, and no stones were seen on imaging.
- The patient has a distended and thickened gallbladder, possibly due to acalculous cholecystitis, cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of the pancreas in the surrounding area.
- She has anemia, likely dilutional from aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation.
- The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is receiving IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
- She is nil per os (NPO), repleting electrolytes as needed, and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on assisted ventilation and has a history of ARDS. There is a possibility of further deterioration in respiratory status.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen or lead to complications such as necrosis or abscess formation.
3. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, and there is a risk of worsening infection or the development of sepsis.
4. Bacteremia: The patient's fevers and rising white blood cell count suggest bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms or complications.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated LFTs indicate liver dysfunction, which may progress if not addressed.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be considered to improve her hemoglobin levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, now with fevers.
   1) Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of
   breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently improving respiratory status, still on AC, PEEP 8,
   largest compromise likely 2.2 b/l pleural effusions
    - will cont diuresis goal - 1l today
    - attempt PS
   2) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD. Calcium, renal function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan completed last night consistent with pancreatitis, no
   hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   3) cholangitis: surgery following, drain in place, unclear if she had
   infection or was passing stone
   #) Fevers, bacteremia: continues to have low-grade temps now with
   rising white count and bandemia
    - will check cdif
    - will check urine, blood, sputum cultures
    - negative, will obtain diagnostic tap abd/belly
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, very aggitated when
   sedation lessened
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and
   direct bili were elevated which was concerning for worsening abdominal
   process, but they have improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 6).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   - Follow up final CT read.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline, although today within
   laboratory error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive
   IVF resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   likely [**3-6**] prolonged hosp and volume
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   #) FEN: NPO, repleting electrolytes as needed. TPN.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family was in, was updated on progress, all questions
   answered, they will call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She is currently intubated for increased work of breathing and has fevers. The patient has respiratory failure, pancreatitis, possible cholangitis, fevers, bacteremia, alcohol abuse, and elevated liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on assisted ventilation with PEEP 8 and may require further interventions such as PSV (partial support ventilation) or extubation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and surgery consultation assistance is appreciated. TPN (total parenteral nutrition) has been initiated, and the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for bowel rest.
3. Cholangitis: The patient has a percutaneous drain in place, and surgery following is recommended. The presence of infection or stone passage is unclear.
4. Fevers and bacteremia: The patient continues to have low-grade temperatures with a rising white count and bandemia. Cultures have been obtained, and diagnostic taps of the abdomen and belly may be necessary.
5. EtOH abuse: Monitoring for signs of withdrawal is important given the patient's possible history of significant alcohol consumption.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, now with fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of
   breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently on AC 450/22/8 with 40% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. No infiltrates on CXR to suggest ARDS. X-ray today
   as well as CT scan consistent with moderate pleural effusions in
   setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation. Last ABG at 4:30 AM: pH 7.41,
   pCO2 48, pO2 80, HCO3 31
          -      Decreased FiO2 to 40% given last ABG; PS trial.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -          Given massively fluid overloaded state (from necessary IVFs
   for pancreatitis), initiated diuresis, continue today goal negative 1 L
   today.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD. Calcium, renal function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of bacteremia from gut
   translocation. CT negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Concern also remains for possible cholangitis, although this has felt
   to be less likely. Med effect also possibility (new med would be zosyn,
   versed, fentanyl)
   - Continue zosyn and vancomycin (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin [**10-28**]).
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites).
   - Re-culture bile, pending.
   - Send c-diff, urine/blood/sputum cx today
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and
   direct bili were elevated which was concerning for worsening abdominal
   process, but they have improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 7).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   - Follow up final CT read.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline, although today within
   laboratory error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive
   IVF resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - Hct stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: NPO, repleting electrolytes as needed. TPN.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family was in, was updated on progress, all questions
   answered, they will call anytime with questions. Per patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. She has been experiencing fevers since October 27th, with a positive blood culture for enterococcus faecalis. The patient's condition is complicated by pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, elevated liver function tests, a distended gallbladder, anemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has multiple lines inserted for various purposes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) given her condition. Monitoring and maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or infected pancreatic necrosis. Regular monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and imaging studies may be necessary.

3. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers since October 27th, and her blood culture revealed enterococcus faecalis. She is at high risk for bacteremia and sepsis. Continued surveillance for signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain,
   intubated for increased work of breathing, now with fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of
   breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal
   distension (which improved after NG placement), some volume overload,
   and possibly beginnings of ARDS (although no infiltrates on chest
   x-ray).  Currently on AC 450/22/8 with 40% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. No infiltrates on CXR to suggest ARDS. X-ray today
   as well as CT scan consistent with moderate pleural effusions in
   setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation. Last ABG at 4:30 AM: pH 7.41,
   pCO2 48, pO2 80, HCO3 31
          -      Decreased FiO2 to 40% given last ABG; PS trial.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -          Given massively fluid overloaded state (from necessary IVFs
   for pancreatitis), initiated diuresis, continue today goal negative 1 L
   today.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD. Calcium, renal function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of bacteremia from gut
   translocation. CT negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Concern also remains for possible cholangitis, although this has felt
   to be less likely. Med effect also possibility (new med would be zosyn,
   versed, fentanyl)
   - Continue zosyn and vancomycin (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin [**10-28**]).
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites).
   - Re-culture bile, pending.
   - Send c-diff, urine/blood/sputum cx today
   #) EtOH abuse: Continuing to monitor for signs of withdrawal given
   possible history of significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of
   [**10-24**]. Likely that LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient had markedly elevated AST (800s at admission)
   greater than ALT, which is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern.
   Her imaging from the OSH demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and
   direct bili were elevated which was concerning for worsening abdominal
   process, but they have improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 7).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   - Follow up final CT read.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline, although today within
   laboratory error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive
   IVF resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - Hct stable

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. The patient presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to discomfort from abdominal distension, volume overload, and possible ARDS. The patient also has ongoing fevers, suspected to be due to bacteremia or cholangitis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Liver function tests are also elevated, but improving. Imaging studies reveal moderate pleural effusions and findings consistent with pancreatitis.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, pancreatitis, fevers, elevated liver enzymes, and anemia. There are no new culture data available, but the patient has been on antibiotics for suspected infection. The patient's family has been updated on her progress, and she has a code status of full.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of pancreatitis, development of sepsis, and further complications related to her liver and gallbladder."

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She is status-post percutaneous drain for possible cholangitis, intubated for increased work of breathing, self-extubated yesterday, and re-intubated. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, pancreatitis, fevers, bacteremia, alcohol abuse, elevated liver function tests, and a distended gallbladder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to increased work of breathing caused by discomfort from abdominal distension and moderate pleural effusions. She required re-intubation after self-extubation, indicating the need for continuous respiratory support.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has suspected pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. Pancreatitis can lead to complications such as infection, necrosis, or abscess formation.
3. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient has been experiencing fevers since [Date range (1) 2161]. Culture data revealed enterococcus, indicating a high risk of bacteremia from gut translocation. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
4. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of significant alcohol consumption, which may lead to withdrawal symptoms and complications such as delirium tremens.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain for
   possible cholangitis, intubated for increased work of breathing,
   self-extubated yesterday and re-intubated.
   #) Respiratory failure: Yesterday patient failed PS trial, which is not
   unexpected given her moderate pleural effusions and total body
   overloaded volume state. She self-extubated, but required immediate
   re-intubation given low oxygen saturations. She was initially intubated
   on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely secondary to both due to
   discomfort of abdominal distension. At this point volume overload
   appears to be her [**Last Name **] problem, as there have been no infiltrates to
   suggest ARDS.  Currently on AC 450/18/8 with 40% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. Chest x-rays and CT scan consistent with moderate
   pleural effusions in setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation.
          -      Will hold off on PS trial until further diuresed.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -          Given massively fluid overloaded state (from necessary IVFs
   for pancreatitis), initiated diuresis, continue today goal negative
   1-1.5 L today, she puts out well to 10 mg IV lasix
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging. Calcium, renal
   function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   - Ideally would refrain from ERCP as her pancreatitis improves, however
   given her edematous gall bladder, without any stones seen, will discuss
   whether ERCP may be of benefit at this time.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**],
   with culture data only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of
   bacteremia from gut translocation. CT negative for abscess or other
   concerning pathology. Concern also remains for possible cholangitis,
   although this has felt to be less likely. Med effect also possibility
   (new med would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Today with increasing bands on differential, which is concerning for
   infection, but culture data otherwise unrevealing and fever curve
   improving (Tmax was 100.4 in last 24 hours).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin.
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites). Holding on paracentesis unless
   fever curve worsens.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Likely that
   LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Initially she had had
   markedly elevated AST (800s at admission) greater than ALT, which was
   consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern. Her imaging from the OSH
   demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and direct bili were elevated
   which was concerning for worsening abdominal process, but they have
   improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs, AST/ALT now back to normal.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 8).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
discussed again today and ERCP team
   recommended MRCP to start off with given that patient is improving.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain for
   possible cholangitis, intubated for increased work of breathing,
   self-extubated yesterday and re-intubated.
   #) Respiratory failure: Yesterday patient failed PS trial, which is not
   unexpected given her moderate pleural effusions and total body
   overloaded volume state. She self-extubated, but required immediate
   re-intubation given low oxygen saturations. She was initially intubated
   on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely secondary to both due to
   discomfort of abdominal distension. At this point volume overload
   appears to be her [**Last Name **] problem, as there have been no infiltrates to
   suggest ARDS.  Currently on AC 450/18/8 with 40% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. Chest x-rays and CT scan consistent with moderate
   pleural effusions in setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation.
          -      Will hold off on PS trial until further diuresed.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -          Given massively fluid overloaded state (from necessary IVFs
   for pancreatitis), initiated diuresis, continue today goal negative
   1-1.5 L today, she puts out well to 10 mg IV lasix
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging. Calcium, renal
   function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   - Ideally would refrain from ERCP as her pancreatitis improves, however
   given her edematous gall bladder, without any stones seen, will discuss
   whether ERCP may be of benefit at this time.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**],
   with culture data only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of
   bacteremia from gut translocation. CT negative for abscess or other
   concerning pathology. Concern also remains for possible cholangitis,
   although this has felt to be less likely. Med effect also possibility
   (new med would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Today with increasing bands on differential, which is concerning for
   infection.
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites). Given that overall fever curve is
   improving (Tmax was 100.4 in last 24 hours), will hold off on further
   investigation, but will have low threshold to tap asxites.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Likely that
   LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Initially she had had
   markedly elevated AST (800s at admission) greater than ALT, which was
   consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern. Her imaging from the OSH
   demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and direct bili were elevated
   which was concerning for worsening abdominal process, but they have
   improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs which are markedly improved, nearly back
   to normal range.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 7).
   - ERCP team aware of patient.
   - Follow up final CT read.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT continues to decline, although today within
   laboratory error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive
   IVF resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - Hct stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has undergone a percutaneous drain for possible cholangitis. The patient self-extubated yesterday but required immediate re-intubation due to low oxygen saturation. She has been on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, and PaO2 of 200 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, as indicated by her failure to pass a spontaneous breathing trial and subsequent self-extubation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, especially considering her moderate pleural effusions and total body overloaded volume state.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is likely secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. There is a possibility of developing complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis or infected pancreatic necrosis.
3. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers and leukocytosis. There is a high risk of bacteremia from gut"

   [**11-2**] ETT in place about 4 cm above the carina
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain for
   possible cholangitis, intubated for increased work of breathing,
   self-extubated again overnight and re-intubated for respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory failure: Overnight, patient again failed PS trial (was
   disynchronously breathing), and also again self-extubated despite being
   in restraints. After extubation, she had a good cough, but appeared to
   quickly fatigue, and needed to be re-intubated. She still has moderate
   pleural effusions and total body overloaded volume state. She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she has had no infiltrates on imaging.
          -    Will continue with PS trials as she is diuresed.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again. Will likely
   use paralytics or further boluses for MRCP to avoid potentially unsafe
   situation of self-extubation off of the floor.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   - Ideally would refrain from ERCP as her pancreatitis improves, however
   given her edematous gall bladder, without any stones seen, may go for
   ERCP after MRCP.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**],
   with culture data only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of
   bacteremia from gut translocation. CT negative for abscess or other
   concerning pathology. Concern also remains for possible cholangitis,
   although this has felt to be less likely. Med effect also possibility
   (new med would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Fever curve appears to be unchanged (Tmax 100.7). Bandemia improved
   with empiric treatment for c. difficile.
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin.
   - Monitoring culture data, considered paracentesis/thoracentesis
   (however not enough ascites to tap at present).
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment yesterday, stool negative x2. On precautions until ruled out.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   -          Pharmacy to weigh in on other sedation options, considering
   haldol trial as well, persodex as extubation approaches
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Still remains unclear what
   underlying process is--no stones have been seen on imaging completed at
   OSH per report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   Currently concern is for bile leak or bile peritonitis, however
   interventional radiology did not feel that ultrasound paracentesis
   would be possible (not enough ascites).
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 8).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
awaiting results of MRCP (to be completed
   today).
   - Per ERCP team, HIDA scan may also be option to evaluate for bile
   leak
will discuss further with surgery as well.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - Hct stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: NPO, repleting electrolytes as needed. On TPN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient underwent percutaneous drain for possible cholangitis, intubation for increased work of breathing, self-extubation, and re-intubation due to respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated multiple times due to increased work of breathing and respiratory distress. She also self-extubated overnight. The patient has moderate pleural effusions and total body overloaded volume state. Continuous monitoring and diuresis are recommended.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. Aggressive fluid resuscitation has been performed, and the patient is on bowel rest with TPN initiated. NG tube decompression and consideration for ERCP after MRCP are planned.

3. Fevers, Bacteremia, Leukocytosis: The patient has had continuous fevers since [Date range (1) 2161], with culture data only revealing enterococcus. There is a high risk of bacteremia from gut translocation. Antibiotics have been narrowed to Zosyn and vancomycin, as enterococcus was sensitive to ampicillin. Monitoring culture data and considering paracentesis/thoracentesis is advised.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain for
   possible cholangitis, intubated for increased work of breathing,
   self-extubated again overnight and re-intubated for respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory failure: Overnight, patient again failed PS trial (was
   disynchronously breathing), and also again self-extubated despite being
   in restraints. After extubation, she had a good cough, but appeared to
   quickly fatigue, and needed to be re-intubated. She still has moderate
   pleural effusions and total body overloaded volume state. She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she has had no infiltrates on imaging.
          -    Will continue with PS trials as she is diuresed.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging. Calcium, renal
   function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   - Ideally would refrain from ERCP as her pancreatitis improves, however
   given her edematous gall bladder, without any stones seen, will discuss
   whether ERCP may be of benefit at this time.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**],
   with culture data only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of
   bacteremia from gut translocation. CT negative for abscess or other
   concerning pathology. Concern also remains for possible cholangitis,
   although this has felt to be less likely. Med effect also possibility
   (new med would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Today with increasing bands on differential, which is concerning for
   infection, but culture data otherwise unrevealing and fever curve
   improving (Tmax was 100.4 in last 24 hours).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin.
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites). Holding on paracentesis unless
   fever curve worsens.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Likely that
   LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Initially she had had
   markedly elevated AST (800s at admission) greater than ALT, which was
   consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern. Her imaging from the OSH
   demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and direct bili were elevated
   which was concerning for worsening abdominal process, but they have
   improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs, AST/ALT now back to normal.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for

","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been intubated multiple times.

The patient's recent events include an unplanned extubation, which led to the initiation of a surgical consultation for paracentesis to evaluate for bile peritonitis/bile leak. Bedside ultrasound did not reveal a suitable window to perform the procedure safely, so radiology was called to perform the procedure using ultrasound guidance. The plan is to leave a drain in place if bile is noted.

The patient also has an increased band count, which is concerning for infection. Empiric treatment for C. difficile has been initiated. The patient's temperature is 100.7 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient's medications include fentanyl, lasix, heparin sodium, and various other medications such as flagyl, thiamine, folic acid, insulin, artificial tears, albuterol/atrovent nebs, Tylenol, chlorhexidine, and heparin SQ.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's height is 66 inches and weight is 165 pounds. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg, and the bladder pressure is 22 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.7 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 28.4%, platelet count of 230 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, total bilirubin level of 26.0%, lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L, albumin level of 2.5 g/dL, calcium level of 8.3 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 3.7 mg/dL.

The patient's chest X-ray shows an endotracheal tube in place about 4 cm above the carina.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory support with pressure support ventilation (PSV), sedation with versed and fentanyl, continuation of diuresis, and monitoring for signs of withdrawal given possible history of significant alcohol consumption.

The patient's pancreatitis is suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. A CT scan is consistent with pancreatitis, and no hemorrhage or abscess was seen. The patient is NPO for bowel rest, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been initiated. Ideally, the patient will refrain from endoscopic retrograde cholangiop"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain for
   possible cholangitis, intubated for increased work of breathing,
   self-extubated yesterday and re-intubated.
   #) Respiratory failure: Yesterday patient failed PS trial, which is not
   unexpected given her moderate pleural effusions and total body
   overloaded volume state. She self-extubated, but required immediate
   re-intubation given low oxygen saturations. She was initially intubated
   on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely secondary to both due to
   discomfort of abdominal distension. At this point volume overload
   appears to be her [**Last Name **] problem, as there have been no infiltrates to
   suggest ARDS.  Currently on AC 450/18/8 with 40% oxygen and doing well,
   appears comfortable. Chest x-rays and CT scan consistent with moderate
   pleural effusions in setting of aggressive IVF resuscitation.
          -      Will hold off on PS trial until further diuresed.
   -          Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -          Given massively fluid overloaded state (from necessary IVFs
   for pancreatitis), initiated diuresis, continue today goal negative
   1-1.5 L today, she puts out well to 10 mg IV lasix
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging. Calcium, renal
   function, UOP, BP all stable.
   - Appreciate surgery consult assistance
no intervention at present.
   - Bolus LR if UOP <50, other hemodynamic instability or worsening
   laboratory functions.
   - CT scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - Sepsis and ARDS risk remain high, continuing to monitor; lactate has
   been WNL.
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   - Ideally would refrain from ERCP as her pancreatitis improves, however
   given her edematous gall bladder, without any stones seen, will discuss
   whether ERCP may be of benefit at this time.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**],
   with culture data only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of
   bacteremia from gut translocation. CT negative for abscess or other
   concerning pathology. Concern also remains for possible cholangitis,
   although this has felt to be less likely. Med effect also possibility
   (new med would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Today with increasing bands on differential, which is concerning for
   infection, but culture data otherwise unrevealing and fever curve
   improving (Tmax was 100.4 in last 24 hours).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin.
   - Continuing to investigate other potential infection sources (eg lung,
   urine, think about tapping ascites). Holding on paracentesis unless
   fever curve worsens.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Likely that
   LFT abnormalities related as discussed below.
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Initially she had had
   markedly elevated AST (800s at admission) greater than ALT, which was
   consistent with alcoholic hepatitis pattern. Her imaging from the OSH
   demonstrated fatty liver as well. T. Bili and direct bili were elevated
   which was concerning for worsening abdominal process, but they have
   improved. No stones have been seen on imaging.
   - Will continue to trend LFTs, AST/ALT now back to normal.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV, HBV sAg/sAb, HAV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Differential is acalculous
   cholecystitis (less likely given drainage from percutaneous tube),
   cholangitis, or secondary to edema and irritation of pancreas in
   surrounding area. No stones noted on imaging completed at OSH per
   report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern for
   possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 8).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
discussed again today and ERCP team
   recommended MRCP to start off with given that patient is improving.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. She is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including bacteremia, leukocytosis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and anemia. The patient has been receiving aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, diuretics, antibiotics, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, as indicated by her need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not adequately addressed.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers, bacteremia, and leukocytosis, suggesting a high risk of infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may continue to progress and could lead to complications such as necrosis or abscess formation.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has elevated LFTs, which may indicate ongoing liver injury. Continued monitoring and supportive care are necessary to prevent further liver damage.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not appropriately managed. It is essential to address the underlying cause and provide supportive care as needed.
6. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given"

   Code status: Full
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. The patient has a complex medical history and is experiencing multiple complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was self-extubated and required re-intubation due to fatigue and low oxygen saturation levels. This indicates a potential respiratory failure and the need for continued ventilatory support.

2. Infection: The patient has an elevated temperature and an increased white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Additionally, the presence of C. difficile is suspected, and the patient has been started on empiric treatment for it.

3. Abdominal issues: The patient underwent an ultrasound to evaluate for paracentesis and also required a guided ultrasound procedure to evaluate for bile peritonitis/bile leak. This suggests the possibility of abdominal pathology, such as liver disease or gastrointestinal complications.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a potential coagulopathy or bleeding risk.

5. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated, which may suggest impaired kidney function.

6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction.

7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium, are outside"

   Culture data: [**10-31**] sputum culture yeast and oropharyngeal flora
rare
   growth. Otherwise no new culture data.
   Chest x-ray: [**11-3**] Persistent right-sided effusion greater than left, no
   other significant change
   [**11-2**] MRCP (Preliminary read):
   Marked gallbladder wall thickening with gallbladder wall being more
   heterogeneous than on the study of [**2162-10-25**]. Gallbladder is collapsed
   around a
   cholecystostomy tube. There is pericholecystic blood in region of
   gallbladder
   neck and porta hepatis. Findings are probably due to inflammation of
   the
   gallbladder secondary to the patient's pancreatitis. No common bile
   duct
   stone is identified. Peripancreatic fluid compatible with acute
   pancreatitis
   without necrosis or fluid collection. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient
s RSBI today was 52. She had previously
   failed self-extubation twice, but in setting of significant sedation,
   secretions, and larger pulmonary effusions resulting in fatigue--she
   had a good cough. She was initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased
   work of breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of
   abdominal distension. Although ARDS has been a concern, she continues
   to have no infiltrates on imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will consider adding valium tomorrow to
   continue to cut down on versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**]. Calling surgery again today to discuss tube feeds given
   recent MRCP results.
   - NG tube in place for decompression
not a significant amount of
   drainage at present.
   - MRCP as noted above, continues to demonstrate findings consistent
   with pancreatitis, no other significant new pathology (no abscess or
   pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Fever to 101 this morning. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. Concern
   also had existed for possible cholangitis, although this has felt to be
   less likely. Med effect also possibility (new meds since
   hospitalization would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started two days ago (WBC down today to 11).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin,

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests. The patient was intubated for increased work of breathing and is currently sedated. She has a distended but soft abdomen with positive bowel sounds. The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to her RSBI (respiratory system compliance and frequency) score. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and may require ongoing respiratory support.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis appears to be secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. There is a possibility of gallstones, but none have been identified on imaging. The patient is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and bowel rest.
3. Fevers, Bacteremia, Leukocytosis: The patient continues to have fevers, and there is a concern for bacteremia. Antibiotics have been narrowed to Zosyn, and it is planned to complete a 14-day course. Cultures are being monitored, and precautions are in place for possible Clostridioides difficile infection.
4. Distended, Thickened Gallbladder: The underlying cause of the gallbladder distension and thickening is unclear."

   [**11-2**] MRCP (Preliminary read):
   Marked gallbladder wall thickening with gallbladder wall being more
   heterogeneous than on the study of [**2162-10-25**]. Gallbladder is collapsed
   around a
   cholecystostomy tube. There is pericholecystic blood in region of
   gallbladder
   neck and porta hepatis. Findings are probably due to inflammation of
   the
   gallbladder secondary to the patient's pancreatitis. No common bile
   duct
   stone is identified. Peripancreatic fluid compatible with acute
   pancreatitis
   without necrosis or fluid collection. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain for
   possible cholangitis, intubated for increased work of breathing,
   self-extubated again overnight and re-intubated for respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory failure: Overnight, patient again failed PS trial (was
   disynchronously breathing), and also again self-extubated despite being
   in restraints. After extubation, she had a good cough, but appeared to
   quickly fatigue, and needed to be re-intubated. She still has moderate
   pleural effusions and total body overloaded volume state. She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she has had no infiltrates on imaging.
          -    Will continue with PS trials as she is diuresed.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again. Will likely
   use paralytics or further boluses for MRCP to avoid potentially unsafe
   situation of self-extubation off of the floor.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   - Ideally would refrain from ERCP as her pancreatitis improves, however
   given her edematous gall bladder, without any stones seen, may go for
   ERCP after MRCP.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**],
   with culture data only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of
   bacteremia from gut translocation. CT negative for abscess or other
   concerning pathology. Concern also remains for possible cholangitis,
   although this has felt to be less likely. Med effect also possibility
   (new med would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Fever curve appears to be unchanged (Tmax 100.7). Bandemia improved
   with empiric treatment for c. difficile.
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin.
   - Monitoring culture data, considered paracentesis/thoracentesis
   (however not enough ascites to tap at present).
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment yesterday, stool negative x2. On precautions until ruled out.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   -          Pharmacy to weigh in on other sedation options, considering
   haldol trial as well, persodex as extubation approaches
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Still remains unclear what
   underlying process is--no stones have been seen on imaging completed at
   OSH per report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   Currently concern is for bile leak or bile peritonitis, however
   interventional radiology did not feel that ultrasound paracentesis

   Chest x-ray: [**11-3**] Persistent right-sided effusion greater than left, no
   other significant change
   [**11-2**] MRCP (Preliminary read):
   Marked gallbladder wall thickening with gallbladder wall being more
   heterogeneous than on the study of [**2162-10-25**]. Gallbladder is collapsed
   around a
   cholecystostomy tube. There is pericholecystic blood in region of
   gallbladder
   neck and porta hepatis. Findings are probably due to inflammation of
   the
   gallbladder secondary to the patient's pancreatitis. No common bile
   duct
   stone is identified. Peripancreatic fluid compatible with acute
   pancreatitis
   without necrosis or fluid collection. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient
s RSBI today was 52. She had previously
   failed self-extubation twice, but in setting of significant sedation,
   secretions, and larger pulmonary effusions resulting in fatigue--she
   had a good cough. She was initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased
   work of breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of
   abdominal distension. Although ARDS has been a concern, she continues
   to have no infiltrates on imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will consider adding valium tomorrow to
   continue to cut down on versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**]. Calling surgery again today to discuss tube feeds given
   recent MRCP results.
   - NG tube in place for decompression
not a significant amount of
   drainage at present.
   - MRCP as noted above, continues to demonstrate findings consistent
   with pancreatitis, no other significant new pathology (no abscess or
   pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Fever to 101 this morning. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. Concern
   also had existed for possible cholangitis, although this has felt to be
   less likely. Med effect also possibility (new meds since
   hospitalization would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started two days ago (WBC down today to 11).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin,
   will plan to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 9).
   - Monitoring culture data, not enough fluid for paracentesis. TTE was
   discussed earlier, and given persistent fevers, will investigate for
   possible endocarditis in setting of one culture positive for
   enterococcous. IJ has been changed since (+) culture, will plan to try
   to place PICC today and d/c CVL. A-line was also re-sited this morning.
   Other consideration would be to check sinuses and consider
   thoracentesis. Will consider stopping Zosyn as well if work-up remains
   negative, as fevers could be secondary to medications or atelectasis as
   well.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 9).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
will follow up on results of MRCP. Per
   surgery team, HIDA will not change management.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: TPN
likely start tube feeds if okay with surgery.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis, ethanol abuse, elevated LFTs, and a distended, thickened gallbladder.

The patient's recent progress includes the following:
- She underwent an ultrasound (US), paracentesis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 11/2.
- The MRI revealed marked gallbladder wall thickening with heterogeneity compared to a previous study. The gallbladder collapsed around a cholecystostomy tube, and there was pericholecystic blood in the region of the gallbladder neck and porta hepatis. These findings were felt to be secondary to inflammation of the gallbladder due to pancreatitis. No common bile duct stone was identified. Peripancreatic fluid was compatible with acute pancreatitis without necrosis or fluid collection.
- The patient's arterial line was stopped on 11/3 and restarted the next day.
- She received a total of 30 mg of lasix IV with good output.
- The patient's mental status improved, as she opens her eyes when called and moves her extremities in response to commands.

   Chest x-ray: [**11-3**] Persistent right-sided effusion greater than left, no
   other significant change
   [**11-2**] MRCP (Preliminary read):
   Marked gallbladder wall thickening with gallbladder wall being more
   heterogeneous than on the study of [**2162-10-25**]. Gallbladder is collapsed
   around a
   cholecystostomy tube. There is pericholecystic blood in region of
   gallbladder
   neck and porta hepatis. Findings are probably due to inflammation of
   the
   gallbladder secondary to the patient's pancreatitis. No common bile
   duct
   stone is identified. Peripancreatic fluid compatible with acute
   pancreatitis
   without necrosis or fluid collection. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with abdominal pain,
   found to have pancreatitis, and is status-post percutaneous drain for
   possible cholangitis, intubated for increased work of breathing,
   self-extubated again overnight and re-intubated for respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient
s RSBI today was 52. She had previously
   failed self-extubation twice, but in setting of significant sedation,
   secretions, and larger pulmonary effusions resulting in fatigue--she
   had a good cough. She was initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased
   work of breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of
   abdominal distension. Although ARDS has been a concern, she continues
   to have no infiltrates on imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again. Will likely
   use paralytics or further boluses for MRCP to avoid potentially unsafe
   situation of self-extubation off of the floor.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**].
   - NG tube in place for decompression.
   - Ideally would refrain from ERCP as her pancreatitis improves, however
   given her edematous gall bladder, without any stones seen, may go for
   ERCP after MRCP.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Continued fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**],
   with culture data only revealing for enterococcous.  High risk of
   bacteremia from gut translocation. CT negative for abscess or other
   concerning pathology. Concern also remains for possible cholangitis,
   although this has felt to be less likely. Med effect also possibility
   (new med would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Fever curve appears to be unchanged (Tmax 100.7). Bandemia improved
   with empiric treatment for c. difficile.
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin.
   - Monitoring culture data, considered paracentesis/thoracentesis
   (however not enough ascites to tap at present).
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment yesterday, stool negative x2. On precautions until ruled out.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Continuing versed boluses as needed, currently no signs of
   withdrawal.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   -          Pharmacy to weigh in on other sedation options, considering
   haldol trial as well, persodex as extubation approaches
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Still remains unclear what
   underlying process is--no stones have been seen on imaging completed at
   OSH per report, and percutaneous drain, which was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted.
   Currently concern is for bile leak or bile peritonitis, however
   interventional radiology did not feel that ultrasound paracentesis
   would be possible (not enough ascites).
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, further recommendations per surgical team
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 8).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
awaiting results of MRCP (to be completed
   today).
   - Per ERCP team, HIDA scan may also be option to evaluate for bile
   leak
will discuss further with surgery as well.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - Hct stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: NPO, repleting electrolytes as needed. On TPN.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions
called last night and
   updated. Per patient
s parents, updates should be relayed to patient
   father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2017**].

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient has been intubated for respiratory distress and has had multiple episodes of self-extubation. She also has a history of alcohol abuse and possible cholangitis. The patient's gallbladder wall is thickened, and there is pericholecystic blood noted in the region of the gallbladder neck and porta hepatis, suggesting inflammation secondary to pancreatitis. There are no stones seen on imaging. The patient's pancreatitis appears to be improving, but she continues to have fevers and bacteremia, likely due to gut translocation. The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and she is still on mechanical ventilation. She is also receiving TPN and IV fluids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's RSBI is 52, indicating the need for continued ventilatory support.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use.
3. Fevers and bacteremia: The patient continues to have fevers and bacteremia, possibly due to gut translocation or cholangitis.
4. Distended, thickened gallbladder: The underlying process causing the gallbladder changes is unclear, but it could be related to alcohol use or bile leak. Further evaluation with ERCP or HIDA scan may be necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable, but there may be a dilutional component due to aggressive IV fluid resuscitation.
6. GERD: The patient is receiving IV PPI for suspected GERD.
7. FEN (nothing specified in the note).
8. PPx (nothing specified in the note).

   Culture Data: None new
   Imaging: Chest x-ray final read pending from this morning.
   [**11-3**] Transthoracic Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
   function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of vegetation or abscess. Normal global
   and regional biventricular systolic function. No diastolic dysfunction,
   pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease seen.
   Final MRCP Read ([**11-2**]):
   1. Markedly thickened gallbladder wall and heterogeneity of the
   gallbladder
   wall likely due to inflammation from the patient's acute pancreatitis.
   There
   is also pericholecystic blood and blood in the region of the porta
   hepatis
   likely due to pancreatitis.
   2. Findings of acute pancreatitis without pancreatic necrosis or acute
   fluid
   collection.
   3. Mildly dilated common bile duct without evidence of stone or
   stricture.
   4. Small amount of ascites increased. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient
s RSBI today was 52. She had previously
   failed self-extubation twice, but in setting of significant sedation,
   secretions, and larger pulmonary effusions resulting in fatigue--she
   had a good cough. She was initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased
   work of breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of
   abdominal distension. Although ARDS has been a concern, she continues
   to have no infiltrates on imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will consider adding valium tomorrow to
   continue to cut down on versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**]. Calling surgery again today to discuss tube feeds given
   recent MRCP results.
   - NG tube in place for decompression
not a significant amount of
   drainage at present.
   - MRCP as noted above, continues to demonstrate findings consistent
   with pancreatitis, no other significant new pathology (no abscess or
   pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Fever to 101 this morning. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. Concern
   also had existed for possible cholangitis, although this has felt to be
   less likely. Med effect also possibility (new meds since
   hospitalization would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started two days ago (WBC down today to 11).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin,
   will plan to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 9).
   - Monitoring culture data, not enough fluid for paracentesis. TTE was
   discussed earlier, and given persistent fevers, will investigate for
   possible endocarditis in setting of one culture positive for
   enterococcous. IJ has been changed since (+) culture, will plan to try
   to place PICC today and d/c CVL. A-line was also re-sited this morning.
   Other consideration would be to check sinuses and consider
   thoracentesis. Will consider stopping Zosyn as well if work-up remains
   negative, as fevers could be secondary to medications or atelectasis as
   well.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 9).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
will follow up on results of MRCP. Per
   surgery team, HIDA will not change management.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: TPN
likely start tube feeds if okay with surgery.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

   Culture Data: None new
   Imaging: Chest x-ray final read pending from this morning.
   [**11-3**] Transthoracic Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
   function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of vegetation or abscess. Normal global
   and regional biventricular systolic function. No diastolic dysfunction,
   pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease seen.
   Final MRCP Read ([**11-2**]):
   1. Markedly thickened gallbladder wall and heterogeneity of the
   gallbladder
   wall likely due to inflammation from the patient's acute pancreatitis.
   There
   is also pericholecystic blood and blood in the region of the porta
   hepatis
   likely due to pancreatitis.
   2. Findings of acute pancreatitis without pancreatic necrosis or acute
   fluid
   collection.
   3. Mildly dilated common bile duct without evidence of stone or
   stricture.
   4. Small amount of ascites increased. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient
s RSBI today was 52. She had previously
   failed self-extubation twice, but in setting of significant sedation,
   secretions, and larger pulmonary effusions resulting in fatigue--she
   had a good cough. She was initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased
   work of breathing likely secondary to both due to discomfort of
   abdominal distension. Although ARDS has been a concern, she continues
   to have no infiltrates on imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will consider adding valium tomorrow to
   continue to cut down on versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**]. Calling surgery again today to discuss tube feeds given
   recent MRCP results.
   - NG tube in place for decompression
not a significant amount of
   drainage at present.
   - MRCP as noted above, continues to demonstrate findings consistent
   with pancreatitis, no other significant new pathology (no abscess or
   pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Fever to 101 this morning. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. Concern
   also had existed for possible cholangitis, although this has felt to be
   less likely. Med effect also possibility (new meds since
   hospitalization would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started two days ago (WBC down today to 11).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin,
   will plan to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 9).
   - Monitoring culture data, not enough fluid for paracentesis. TTE was
   discussed earlier, and given persistent fevers, will investigate for
   possible endocarditis in setting of one culture positive for
   enterococcous. IJ has been changed since (+) culture, will plan to try
   to place PICC today and d/c CVL. A-line was also re-sited this morning.
   Other consideration would be to check sinuses and consider
   thoracentesis. Will consider stopping Zosyn as well if work-up remains
   negative, as fevers could be secondary to medications or atelectasis as
   well.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 9).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
will follow up on results of MRCP. Per
   surgery team, HIDA will not change management.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: TPN
likely start tube feeds if okay with surgery.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted for pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests, and subsequently intubated for increased work of breathing. The patient's RSBI today was 52, indicating respiratory failure. She has been experiencing fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis, and is suspected to have secondary pancreatitis. The patient's elevated LFTs have resolved, and her anemia is likely dilutional from aggressive IV fluid resuscitation. She also has a distended, thickened gallbladder likely due to irritation from pancreatitis. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's RSBI of 52 indicates respiratory failure. She has failed self-extubation twice and has moderate bilateral pleural effusions. There is a concern for ARDS, but she continues to have no infiltrates on imaging. Spontaneous breathing trials will be considered if she does well, and extubation may be attempted soon.
2. Fevers, Bacteremia, Leukocytosis: The patient has had persistent fevers since [Date range (1) 2161], with culture data revealing for enterococcus. The source of infection could be related to gut translocation or medication effects. Antibiotics have been narrowed to Zosyn, and"

   [**11-3**] Transthoracic Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
   function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of vegetation or abscess. Normal global
   and regional biventricular systolic function. No diastolic dysfunction,
   pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease seen.
   Final MRCP Read ([**11-2**]):
   1. Markedly thickened gallbladder wall and heterogeneity of the
   gallbladder
   wall likely due to inflammation from the patient's acute pancreatitis.
   There

   collection.
   3. Mildly dilated common bile duct without evidence of stone or
   stricture.
   4. Small amount of ascites increased. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Respiratory was unable to complete RSBI due to
   sedation this morning.  Yesterday she did not do well with She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates on
   imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation again later today (yesterday attempts limited by
   need for increased sedation with TTE and PICC).
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will discuss appropriate transition of either
   increasing methadone or adding valium with pharmacy today.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to remain in place to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - TPN initiated [**10-29**], and tube feeds started today.
   - MRCP as noted above, findings consistent with pancreatitis, no other
   significant new pathology (no abscess or pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve,
   continued to have fever over last 24 hours (101.3). No new culture
   data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data only
   revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT and
   MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started 3 days ago (bandemia much improved).
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 10) from time of (+)
   blood cultures ([**10-27**]).
   - Monitoring culture data, not enough fluid for paracentesis. In
   setting of enterococcous bacteremia, seeding of valve was possible, but
   TTE was completely WNL . IJ has been changed since (+) culture, and was
   pulled yesterday when PICC placed. A-line also removed yesterday. Other
   considerations have been to check sinuses and consider thoracentesis.
   Fevers could be secondary to medications or atelectasis as well.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course of 14 days.
   - ID consult to be requested today to help evaluated persistent fevers
   and other appropriate work up or changing antibiotics. Appreciate
   assistance.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day
   10), continuing to monitor culture data.
   - MRCP as noted above.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

- She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected enterococcal bacteremia, which is improving.
- Her anemia is stable, and no hemorrhagic component was noted on the CT scan.
- She has a history of alcohol abuse and GERD.
- Her family is aware of her progress and has been updated regularly.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial reason for ICU admission was respiratory failure. She has had difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to sedation issues and may require further extubation attempts.

   Culture Data: None new
   Imaging: Chest x-ray final read pending from this morning.
   [**11-3**] Transthoracic Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
   function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of vegetation or abscess. Normal global
   and regional biventricular systolic function. No diastolic dysfunction,
   pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease seen.
   Final MRCP Read ([**11-2**]):
   1. Markedly thickened gallbladder wall and heterogeneity of the
   gallbladder
   wall likely due to inflammation from the patient's acute pancreatitis.
   There
   is also pericholecystic blood and blood in the region of the porta
   hepatis
   likely due to pancreatitis.
   2. Findings of acute pancreatitis without pancreatic necrosis or acute
   fluid
   collection.
   3. Mildly dilated common bile duct without evidence of stone or
   stricture.
   4. Small amount of ascites increased. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Respiratory was unable to complete RSBI due to
   sedation this morning.  Yesterday she did not do well with She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates on
   imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation again later today (yesterday attempts limited by
   need for increased sedation with TTE and PICC).
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will discuss appropriate transition of either
   increasing methadone or adding valium with pharmacy today.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to remain in place to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - TPN initiated [**10-29**]. Calling surgery again today to discuss tube feeds
   given recent MRCP results.
   - NG tube in place for decompression
not a significant amount of
   drainage at present.
   - MRCP as noted above, continues to demonstrate findings consistent
   with pancreatitis, no other significant new pathology (no abscess or
   pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Fever to 101 this morning. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. Concern
   also had existed for possible cholangitis, although this has felt to be
   less likely. Med effect also possibility (new meds since
   hospitalization would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started two days ago (WBC down today to 11).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin,
   will plan to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 9).
   - Monitoring culture data, not enough fluid for paracentesis. TTE was
   discussed earlier, and given persistent fevers, will investigate for
   possible endocarditis in setting of one culture positive for
   enterococcous. IJ has been changed since (+) culture, will plan to try
   to place PICC today and d/c CVL. A-line was also re-sited this morning.
   Other consideration would be to check sinuses and consider
   thoracentesis. Will consider stopping Zosyn as well if work-up remains
   negative, as fevers could be secondary to medications or atelectasis as
   well.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 9).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
will follow up on results of MRCP. Per
   surgery team, HIDA will not change management.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: TPN
likely start tube feeds if okay with surgery.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, suspected to be secondary to discomfort from abdominal distension. She underwent an emergency intubation on [**10-28**]. The patient's current condition is improving, but she still requires sedation. She has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, likely secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. She also has an elevated white blood cell count, fevers, and bandemia. The patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and is stable. There are no new significant findings on imaging, and her condition is improving. She has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and will be considered for tube feeds if okay with surgery. The patient's family has been informed about her progress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for respiratory failure. She may still face challenges with weaning off the ventilator due to sedation needs.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, or systemic inflammation.
3. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis. There is a concern for bacteremia, possibly due to gut translocation. Continued monitoring and antibiotic therapy are necessary.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: Considering the patient"

   Culture Data: None new
   Imaging: Chest x-ray final read pending from this morning.
   [**11-3**] Transthoracic Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
   function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of vegetation or abscess. Normal global
   and regional biventricular systolic function. No diastolic dysfunction,
   pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease seen.
   Final MRCP Read ([**11-2**]):
   1. Markedly thickened gallbladder wall and heterogeneity of the
   gallbladder
   wall likely due to inflammation from the patient's acute pancreatitis.
   There
   is also pericholecystic blood and blood in the region of the porta
   hepatis
   likely due to pancreatitis.
   2. Findings of acute pancreatitis without pancreatic necrosis or acute
   fluid
   collection.
   3. Mildly dilated common bile duct without evidence of stone or
   stricture.
   4. Small amount of ascites increased. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Respiratory was unable to complete RSBI due to
   sedation this morning.  Yesterday she did not do well with She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates on
   imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will consider adding valium tomorrow to
   continue to cut down on versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**]. Calling surgery again today to discuss tube feeds given
   recent MRCP results.
   - NG tube in place for decompression
not a significant amount of
   drainage at present.
   - MRCP as noted above, continues to demonstrate findings consistent
   with pancreatitis, no other significant new pathology (no abscess or
   pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Fever to 101 this morning. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. Concern
   also had existed for possible cholangitis, although this has felt to be
   less likely. Med effect also possibility (new meds since
   hospitalization would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started two days ago (WBC down today to 11).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin,
   will plan to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 9).
   - Monitoring culture data, not enough fluid for paracentesis. TTE was
   discussed earlier, and given persistent fevers, will investigate for
   possible endocarditis in setting of one culture positive for
   enterococcous. IJ has been changed since (+) culture, will plan to try
   to place PICC today and d/c CVL. A-line was also re-sited this morning.
   Other consideration would be to check sinuses and consider
   thoracentesis. Will consider stopping Zosyn as well if work-up remains
   negative, as fevers could be secondary to medications or atelectasis as
   well.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 9).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
will follow up on results of MRCP. Per
   surgery team, HIDA will not change management.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: TPN
likely start tube feeds if okay with surgery.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pancreatitis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, but showing signs of improvement. 

The patient's recent events include a transesophageal echo (TTE) that showed no vegetations or abscess, indicating no evidence of endocarditis. The TTE also revealed normal biventricular systolic function, no diastolic dysfunction, and no significant valvular disease. An MRCP showed findings consistent with pancreatitis, but no other significant new pathology. 

The patient has been experiencing fevers, and there is a concern for bacteremia and leukocytosis. Her WBC count is elevated, but has improved with empiric treatment for C. difficile. Antibiotics have been narrowed to Zosyn, which was started on October 25th and will be completed for at least 14 days. 

The patient's other medical conditions include alcohol abuse, anemia, GERD, and a distended, thickened gallbladder likely secondary to irritation from pancreatitis. Her elevated liver function tests (LFTs) have resolved, and she has been on IV PPI for GERD. 

The patient's plan includes a spontaneous breathing trial today if she does well, with consideration for extubation. She will continue to be sedated with versed and fentanyl, transitioning to methadone per protocol. The goal is to diurese 1500-2000cc negative today, and she responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix. Mitts will be placed to prevent extubation again. 

Regarding her pancreatitis, the patient will remain NPO for bowel rest, with TPN initiated on October 29th. Surgery is being consulted again today to discuss tube feeds given recent MRCP results. An NG tube is in place for decompression, but there is not a significant amount of drainage at present. 

The patient's code status is full, confirmed with the patient. Her family is aware of her progress, and updates should be relayed to her father."

   Culture Data: None new
   Imaging: Chest x-ray final read pending from this morning.
   [**11-3**] Transthoracic Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
   function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
   There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of vegetation or abscess. Normal global
   and regional biventricular systolic function. No diastolic dysfunction,
   pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease seen.
   Final MRCP Read ([**11-2**]):
   1. Markedly thickened gallbladder wall and heterogeneity of the
   gallbladder
   wall likely due to inflammation from the patient's acute pancreatitis.
   There
   is also pericholecystic blood and blood in the region of the porta
   hepatis
   likely due to pancreatitis.
   2. Findings of acute pancreatitis without pancreatic necrosis or acute
   fluid
   collection.
   3. Mildly dilated common bile duct without evidence of stone or
   stricture.
   4. Small amount of ascites increased. New moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Respiratory was unable to complete RSBI due to
   sedation this morning.  Yesterday she did not do well with She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates on
   imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation.
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will consider adding valium tomorrow to
   continue to cut down on versed and fentanyl.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to be placed to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - NPO for bowel rest, no tube feeds per surgery recommendations, TPN
   initiated [**10-29**]. Calling surgery again today to discuss tube feeds given
   recent MRCP results.
   - NG tube in place for decompression
not a significant amount of
   drainage at present.
   - MRCP as noted above, continues to demonstrate findings consistent
   with pancreatitis, no other significant new pathology (no abscess or
   pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Fever to 101 this morning. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. Concern
   also had existed for possible cholangitis, although this has felt to be
   less likely. Med effect also possibility (new meds since
   hospitalization would be zosyn, versed, fentanyl).
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started two days ago (WBC down today to 11).
   - Antibiotics currently narrowed to zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**],
   vancomycin [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin,
   will plan to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 9).
   - Monitoring culture data, not enough fluid for paracentesis. TTE was
   discussed earlier, and given persistent fevers, will investigate for
   possible endocarditis in setting of one culture positive for
   enterococcous. IJ has been changed since (+) culture, will plan to try
   to place PICC today and d/c CVL. A-line was also re-sited this morning.
   Other consideration would be to check sinuses and consider
   thoracentesis. Will consider stopping Zosyn as well if work-up remains
   negative, as fevers could be secondary to medications or atelectasis as
   well.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course.
   #) EtOH abuse: No longer tachycardic or hypertensive. Considerable
   sedation needs, suspected to be related to EtOH consumption. Continuing
   to monitor for signs of withdrawal given possible history of
   significant consumption. Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Following cx data, NGTD from [**Hospital3 735**].
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day 9).
   - ERCP team aware of patient
will follow up on results of MRCP. Per
   surgery team, HIDA will not change management.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable, although today within laboratory
   error. Large degree was likely dilutional from aggressive IVF
   resuscitation. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: TPN
likely start tube feeds if okay with surgery.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, suspected pancreatitis, and elevated liver function tests. The patient has been intubated and sedated due to increased work of breathing and discomfort from abdominal distension. She has had fevers, bacteremia, and leukocytosis, and her condition has been complicated by alcohol withdrawal, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated for increased work of breathing, and she continues to require mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about spontaneous breathing trials and extubation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. She has been aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable. TPN has been initiated, and there are plans to discuss tube feeds with the surgery team.
3. Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: The patient has had persistent fevers, and cultures have revealed enterococcus. Antibiotics have been narrowed to Zosyn, and a 14-day course is planned. The source of infection is still being investigated, with considerations for endocarditis given the positive culture for enterococcus.
4. EtOH abuse: The patient has a history of significant alcohol consumption, and there are concerns about alcohol withdrawal."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Respiratory was unable to complete RSBI due to
   sedation this morning.  Yesterday she did not do well with She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates on
   imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation again later today (yesterday attempts limited by
   need for increased sedation with TTE and PICC).
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will discuss appropriate transition of either
   increasing methadone or adding valium with pharmacy today.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to remain in place to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - TPN initiated [**10-29**], and tube feeds started today.
   - MRCP as noted above, findings consistent with pancreatitis, no other
   significant new pathology (no abscess or pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve,
   continued to have fever over last 24 hours (101.3). No new culture
   data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data only
   revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT and
   MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Bandemia improved with empiric treatment for c. difficile with flagyl
   started 3 days ago (bandemia much improved).
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 10) from time of (+)
   blood cultures ([**10-27**]).
   - Monitoring culture data, not enough fluid for paracentesis. In
   setting of enterococcous bacteremia, seeding of valve was possible, but
   TTE was completely WNL . IJ has been changed since (+) culture, and was
   pulled yesterday when PICC placed. A-line also removed yesterday. Other
   considerations have been to check sinuses and consider thoracentesis.
   Fevers could be secondary to medications or atelectasis as well.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course of 14 days.
   - ID consult to be requested today to help evaluated persistent fevers
   and other appropriate work up or changing antibiotics. Appreciate
   assistance.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day
   10), continuing to monitor culture data.
   - MRCP as noted above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and gallbladder edema. The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing secondary to discomfort from abdominal distension. Although ARDS was a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates on imaging.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for increased work of breathing. A spontaneous breathing trial will be attempted today if she does well, and extubation may be considered later today.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has suspected pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. CT scans show findings consistent with pancreatitis, but no hemorrhage or abscess.
3. Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: The patient has had persistent fevers since [Date range (1) 2161], with culture data revealing enterococcus. Antibiotics have been started empirically, and the patient is being monitored closely. Bandemia improved with treatment for c. difficile.
4. Alcohol abuse: The patient's last known drink was on [10-24]. Sedation taper and transition are being planned.
5. Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved, likely secondary to alcohol use. Hepatitis serologies are negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Respiratory was unable to complete RSBI due to
   sedation this morning.  Yesterday she did not do well with She was
   initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing likely
   secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension. Although
   ARDS has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates on
   imaging.
          -    Spontaneous breathing trial today
if she does well, will
   consider extubation again later today (yesterday attempts limited by
   need for increased sedation with TTE and PICC).
   -    Sedation with versed and fentanyl
currently transitioning to
   methadone per protocol, will discuss appropriate transition of either
   increasing methadone or adding valium with pharmacy today.
   -   Continuing to diurese
goal 1500cc to 2000cc net negative today,
   responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix.
   -   Mitts to remain in place to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides,
   alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have passed stone given
   dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT scan consistent
   with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen. Patient was
   aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far as her
   pancreatitis is concerned.
   - TPN initiated [**10-29**], and tube feeds started today.
   - MRCP as noted above, findings consistent with pancreatitis, no other
   significant new pathology (no abscess or pancreatitic hemorrhage).
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve,
   continued to have fever over last 24 hours (101.3). No new culture
   data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data only

   - ID consult to be requested today to help evaluated persistent fevers
   and other appropriate work up or changing antibiotics. Appreciate
   assistance.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis resolved. Was likely secondary to
   alcohol use (initial AST >800). Hepatitis serologies all negative (HCV,
   HBV sAg/sAb, HAV). Continuing to monitor trend.

   CXR: [**11-5**] final read pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Will continue to work on sponatenous breathing
   trial
today patient was too sedated (after episode of agitation and
   trying to get out of bed) to continue taking adequate tital volumes, so
   he was switched over to pressure support. Will again try breathing
   trial and aim to extubate today if possible. It is possible that her
   abdominal distension and pleural effusions are making weaning
   difficult.
   .
   She was initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing
   likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension.
   Although ARDS has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates
   on imaging.
          -     Sedation with versed and fentanyl
levels of sedation have
   dramatically decreased, and will space out methadone dosing to Q6H, and
   add on valium 10 mg IV TID to wean levels of other medications, as
   valium will self-taper.
   -   Continuing to diurese
will be less aggressive given small bump in
   creatinine, responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix (HCO2 also slightly up
   which is likely contraction alkalosis)
   -   Mitts to remain in place to help prevent extubation again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as her pancreatitis is concerned.
   - Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Bandemia and WBC appear to have improved since initiation of flagyl.
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 12) from time of (+)
   blood cultures ([**10-27**]).
   - Appreciate ID recommendations. All lines have been changed,
   ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis. Will
   come to conclusion regarding thoracentesis, additional imaging today.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course of 14 days
   (today is day 5).
   - ID consult to be requested today to help evaluated persistent fevers
   and other appropriate work up or changing antibiotics. Appreciate
   assistance.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks time.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day
   12), continuing to monitor culture data.
   - MRCP as noted above.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient

   updates should be relayed to patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests. She was intubated due to increased work of breathing, likely secondary to discomfort from abdominal distension. Although acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates on imaging.

The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 97/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also stable.

The patient's abdominal distension and pleural effusions may be making weaning difficult. Sedation levels have been decreased, and methadone dosing is being spaced out to every 6 hours. Valium 10 mg IV TID will be added to wean levels of other medications.

The patient has stable pancreatitis, with no pain and no hemorrhage or abscess seen on imaging. She has been aggressively fluid-resuscitated and continues to receive tube feeds.

The patient has had fevers since [Date range (1) 2161], with culture data revealing enterococcus. No new culture data are available, and the CT and"

   CXR [**11-6**]: Bilateral pleural effusions
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Will continue to work on spontaneous breathing
   trial again today. It is possible that her abdominal distension and
   pleural effusions are making weaning difficult, but likely sedation is
   the major factor.
   - Continue weaning sedation
   - SBT today
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as her pancreatitis is concerned.
   - Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Bandemia and WBC appear to have improved since initiation of flagyl.
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was transferred to the ICU for pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is intubated due to increased work of breathing and is currently improving but has challenging sedation needs. 

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and attempts will be made to wean her off mechanical ventilation today. Her abdominal distension and pleural effusions may be contributing to the difficulty in weaning her from the ventilator, but sedation is believed to be the major factor. 

The patient's pancreatitis appears to be stable, with no pain reported. It is suspected to be secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. There is a possibility that the patient may have passed a stone, but none have been seen on imaging. The CT scan shows signs consistent with pancreatitis, and no hemorrhage or abscess has been observed. The patient has been aggressively fluid-resuscitated and has been stable in terms of her pancreatitis.

The patient has been experiencing fevers since [Date range (1) 2161], with culture data revealing enterococcus, presumably from gut translocation. A CT scan and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) have been negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. Bandemia and white blood cell (W"

   CXR [**11-6**]: Bilateral pleural effusions
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Will continue to work on sponatenous breathing
   trial again today. It is possible that her abdominal distension and
   pleural effusions are making weaning difficult, but likely sedation is
   the major factor.
   .
   She was initially intubated on [**10-28**] for increased work of breathing
   likely secondary to both due to discomfort of abdominal distension.
   Although ARDS has been a concern, she continues to have no infiltrates
   on imaging.
          -     Sedation with versed and fentanyl
levels of sedation have
   dramatically decreased, and will space out methadone dosing to Q6H, and
   add on valium 10 mg IV TID to wean levels of other medications, as
   valium will self-taper.
   -   Continuing to diurese
will be less aggressive given small bump in
   creatinine, responds well to 10-20 mg IV lasix (HCO2 also slightly up
   which is likely contraction alkalosis)
   -   Mitts to remain in place to help prevent premature extubation
   again.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as her pancreatitis is concerned.
   - Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Bandemia and WBC appear to have improved since initiation of flagyl.
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 13) from time of (+)
   blood cultures ([**10-27**]).
   - Appreciate ID recommendations. All lines have been changed,
   ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis. Held
   off on [**Female First Name (un) 217**] or additional imaging at present. If pt [**Last Name (LF) 1445**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation support and sedation. There have been several significant events in the past 24 hours.

The patient failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) between the 3rd and 6th day, likely due to sedation. As a result, the patient was placed back on assisted control (AC) mode of ventilation. After making this change, the patient's oxygen saturation levels were lower and required increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The patient's allergy includes codeine, and there is an unknown allergy as well. The patient has been receiving various medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole for antibiotic coverage. Other medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, haloperidol, and diazepam.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/89 mmHg to 97/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,099 mL with 546 mL given through intravenous fluids. The total output includes 2,445"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently weaning sedation in preparation
   of extubation.
   #) Respiratory failure: Will continue to work on spontaneous breathing
   trial again today. It is possible that her abdominal distension and
   pleural effusions are making weaning difficult, but likely sedation
   continues to be the major factor. Significant progress has been made
   over last 24 hours in weaning her sedation down, and she continues to
   do well on MMV.
   - Continue weaning sedation
   - SBT today, possible extubation if she does well.
   - Continuing to diurese as tolerated by renal function (stable at 1.0
   today), goal 1000 cc to 1500 cc negative today.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   - Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis.
   Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl.
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 14, however only day
   12 since (+) blood cultures on [**10-27**])
   - Appreciate ID recommendations. Held off on thoracentesis or
   additional imaging at present.  Will discuss today possibly adding
   antifungal coverage as per ID recs.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 7).
   - Checking differential today given rising WBC
   - Will discuss other work-up, such as scanning sinuses (eg NG tube in
   place) today.
   - Rising platelet count (599 up from 100
s-200
s) could also be
   suggestive of infection.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day
   14), continuing to monitor culture data.
   - MRCP as noted above.
   #) Anemia: Today patient
s HCT trended down slightly, from 23.1 to
   22.6. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not had any
   evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted on CT
   previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as well.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   - Given slow decline (as opposed to acute), will hold off on additional
   imaging of abdomen, but consider if continues to decline.
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.

   to update them on progress. Per patient
s parents, updates should be
   relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2017**].

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently weaning sedation in preparation
   of extubation.
   #) Respiratory failure: Will continue to work on spontaneous breathing
   trial again today. It is possible that her abdominal distension and
   pleural effusions are making weaning difficult, but likely sedation
   continues to be the major factor. Significant progress has been made
   over last 24 hours in weaning her sedation down, and she continues to
   do well on MMV.
   - Continue weaning sedation
   - SBT today, possible extubation if she does well.
   - Continuing to diurese as tolerated by renal function (stable at 1.0
   today), goal 1000 cc to 1500 cc negative today.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   - Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis.
   Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl.
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 14, however only day
   12 since (+) blood cultures on [**10-27**])
   - Appreciate ID recommendations. Held off on thoracentesis or
   additional imaging at present.  Will discuss today possibly adding
   antifungal coverage as per ID recs.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 7).
   - Checking differential today given rising WBC
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day
   14), continuing to monitor culture data.
   - MRCP as noted above.
   #) Anemia: Today patient
s HCT trended down slightly, from 23.1 to
   22.6. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not had any
   evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted on CT
   previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as well.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   - Given slow decline (as opposed to acute), will hold off on additional
   imaging of abdomen, but consider if continues to decline.
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .

   to update them on progress. Per patient
s parents, updates should be
   relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2017**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pancreatitis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated but showing signs of improvement in weaning sedation. Her respiratory status is stable on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. There are no abscesses or other concerning pathologies seen on imaging. The patient has had fevers since [Date range (1) 2161], with culture data revealing enterococcus, which is likely from gut translocation. All lines have been changed or pulled, and she is currently on antibiotics (Zosyn) for the fevers. The patient's anemia is likely due to phlebotomy and not acute bleeding. Her gallbladder appears distended and thickened, possibly secondary to irritation from pancreatitis. A percutaneous drain was placed, but only bile was drained. The patient's HCT trended down slightly, but there is no evidence of bleeding, and she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted on CT previously. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and GERD. She is receiving tube feeds and IV PPI for GERD. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently improving but with challenging
   sedation needs.
   #) Respiratory failure: Will continue to work on spontaneous breathing
   trial again today. It is possible that her abdominal distension and
   pleural effusions are making weaning difficult, but likely sedation is
   the major factor.
   - Continue weaning sedation
   - SBT today
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as her pancreatitis is concerned.
   - Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology.
   Bandemia and WBC appear to have improved since initiation of flagyl.
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 14) from time of (+)
   blood cultures ([**10-27**]
day 12 since [**10-27**])
   - Appreciate ID recommendations. All lines have been changed,
   ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis. Held
   off on [**Female First Name (un) 217**] or additional imaging at present. If pt [**Last Name (LF) 1445**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   consider adding antifungal coverage as per ID recs.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given significant improvement in
   bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment course of 14 days
   (today is day 5).
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine are in TPN, but supplementing as well.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Currently, based on imaging,
   appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to irritation from
   her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging at OSH or here.
   At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed stone given
   dilated duct noted.
   Unable to check for bile in ascites as it has resolved, HIDA not felt
   to be helpful.
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks.
   - Zosyn for fevers, as noted above, (was started [**10-25**], today is day
   13), continuing to monitor culture data.
   - MRCP as noted above.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT stable. No hemorrhagic component noted on CT.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend
   .
   #) GERD: Continuing IV PPI
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) is aware of patient
   progress, knows to call anytime with questions. Per patient
s parents,
   updates should be relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and other complications. She has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been improving gradually. However, she continues to have fevers, and there is a suspicion of bacteremia. The patient is also anemic, but her HCT levels are stable. There is a plan to perform a cholecystectomy in 6 weeks due to a distended and thickened gallbladder. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, PPI, and tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was admitted for respiratory failure, and she remains intubated. There is a possibility of weaning her off mechanical ventilation, but sedation and abdominal distension are making it challenging. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are necessary to assess her progress in spontaneous breathing trials.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which appears to be secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use. CT scan shows signs consistent with pancreatitis without hemorrhage or abscess. The patient's pancreatitis is stable, and she is being aggressively fluid resuscitated.

3. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient has had persistent fevers since [Date range (1) 2161]. Blood cultures revealed enterococcus, and she"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently weaning sedation in preparation
   of extubation, with continued fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Will continue to work on spontaneous breathing
   trial again today. It is possible that her abdominal distension and
   pleural effusions are making weaning difficult, but likely that
   sedation continues to be the major factor. Significant progress has
   been made over last 24 hours in weaning her sedation down, and she
   continues to do well on MMV with adequate minute ventilation (5-6L).
   - Continue weaning sedation
will use haldol and possibly persodex to
   avoid agents that suppress her respiratory rate, and further taper down
   versed (to 7) and fentanyl (85).
   - SBT today, possible extubation if she does well on 0/5.
   - Continuing to diurese as tolerated by renal function (stable at 1.0
   today), goal 1000 cc to 1500 cc negative today.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   - Holding tube feeds in preparation of possible extubation.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis.
   Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl.
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 14, however only day
   12 since (+) blood cultures on [**10-27**]), will discuss possibly stopping to
   see if fever curve changes.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations. Held off on thoracentesis or
   additional imaging at present.  Will discuss today possibly adding
   antifungal coverage as per ID recs.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 7).
   - Checking differential today given rising WBC
   - Will discuss other work-up, such as scanning sinuses (eg NG tube in
   place) today.
   - Rising platelet count (599 up from 100
s-200
s) could also be
   suggestive of infection (can also be seen with iron deficiency, but her
   iron studies were more consistent with anemia of chronic disease).
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Unable to check for bile in ascites as
   it has resolved, HIDA not felt to be helpful.
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks.
   #) Anemia: Today patient
s HCT trended down slightly, from 23.1 to
   22.6. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not had any
   evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted on CT
   previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as well.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   - Given slow decline (as opposed to acute), will hold off on additional
   imaging of abdomen, but consider if continues to decline.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds on hold for possible extubation.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) to visit today, will plan
   to update them on progress. Per patient
s parents, updates should be
   relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2017**].

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted for pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests. She was intubated for increased work of breathing and is currently weaning sedation in preparation for extubation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 129/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a sinus rhythm and has shown improvement in weaning sedation.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.4 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and slightly low platelet count. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient has been on antibiotics since day 12. The patient's kidney function is stable, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions and low lung volumes but no significant change from yesterday. The abdominal ultrasound did not reveal enough fluid for paracentesis.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, pancreatitis, fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis, ethanol abuse, distended and thickened gallbladder, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and feeding intolerance.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient is unable to sustain spontaneous breathing, persistent fevers and bacteremia leading to sepsis, further complications related to pancreatitis such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation, and potential relapse into alcohol abuse.

Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She is currently weaning sedation in preparation for extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her lab results show signs of infection and pancreatitis. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions and low lung volumes. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, pancreatitis, fevers, bacteremia, ethanol abuse, and anemia. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, persistent fevers and bacteremia leading to sepsis, complications related to pancreatitis, and potential relapse into alcohol abuse."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who unfortunately did not tolerate a
   breathing trial this morning, and with continued fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Unfortunately patient did not tolerate
   breathing trial this morning, and sedation did not appear to be a
   factor. At this time, need to start thinking about tracheostomy to wean
   patient from ventilator if unable to find an intervenable reason for
   failure to wean (eg pneumonia or significant effusion not seen well on
   chest x-ray).
   - Patient was on [**Month/Day (1) **], however now approaching 24 hours on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will need to switch back to versed and fentanyl (at lower
   doses) and use haldol as well for agitation. Will titrate down
   methadone from Q6H to Q8H.
   - Will image chest with CTA to rule out PE given hypoxia, look for
   pneumonia, evidence of loculated effusions or significant effusions
   that might be beneficial to drain.
   - Will consult IP tomorrow to discuss trach (possibly PEG) if no
   obvious new abnormalities seen on chest CT
   - Will be less aggressive with regards to diuresis given dye load with
   CTA.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          Given persistent fevers and fact that patient is now two
   weeks out from pancreatitis, will re-image abdomen while patient is
   getting chest CT to evaluate for potential source of infection.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Persistent fevers overnight. No
   new culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis. Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of
   flagyl.
   - Completed 14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered
   entercoccous in one blood
   - Appreciate ID recommendations. Obtaining CT chest to look for
   loculated effusion, will consider thoracentesis. Will also scan sinuses
   while patient is down in CT scan, as this could be source of persistent
   fevers.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 8).
   - Rising platelet count (above 600 now, up from 100
s-200
s) could also
   be suggestive of infection or acute phase reactant (can also be seen
   with iron deficiency, but her iron studies were more consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease).
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Unable to check for bile in ascites as
   it has resolved, HIDA not felt to be helpful.
   -          Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6
   weeks.
   -          CT abdomen today
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   - Given slow decline (as opposed to acute), will hold off on additional
   imaging of abdomen, but consider if continues to decline.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).
   .
   #) FEN: Resuming tube feeds
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.

s parents, updates should be relayed
   to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2017**]. [**Name2 (NI) 133**] try to arrange

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests. The patient was intubated for increased work of breathing and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers and has not tolerated any spontaneous breathing trials. She has a tracheostomy planned if she is unable to be weaned from the ventilator. A CT angiography (CTA) is also ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, or significant effusions that may need to be drained.

The patient's pancreatitis appears to be stable, but persistent fevers and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. Cultures have grown enterococcus, and the patient has completed a 14-day course of Zosyn, which covered this organism. Antibiotic treatment for C. difficile has been started empirically, and the stool has been negative twice.

The patient's anemia is stable, and iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease. There is no evidence of bleeding currently, and phlebotomy is likely playing a role as well.

The patient's gallbladder is distended and thickened, likely secondary to irritation from pancreatitis. A percutaneous drain has been placed, but no stones have been seen on imaging. A cholecystectomy is planned in 6 weeks.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of codeine allergy and unknown allergies. He has been experiencing fever, elevated heart rate, and increased blood pressure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His recent blood cultures showed >25 PMNs, 1+ Gram-negative rods in the sputum culture, and NGTD x4 in the blood culture. His most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 53 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated at 1.1 mg/dL, while his white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range. Other lab results, including electrolyte levels and liver function tests, are within normal limits. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and diuretics.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, currently weaning sedation in preparation
   of extubation, with continued fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Will continue to work on spontaneous breathing
   trial again today. It is possible that her abdominal distension and
   pleural effusions are making weaning difficult, but likely that
   sedation continues to be the major factor. Significant progress has
   been made over last 24 hours in weaning her sedation down, and she
   continues to do well on MMV with adequate minute ventilation (5-6L).
   - Continue weaning sedation
will use haldol and possibly persodex to
   avoid agents that suppress her respiratory rate, and further taper down
   versed (to 7) and fentanyl (85).
   - SBT today, possible extubation if she does well on 0/5.
   - Continuing to diurese as tolerated by renal function (stable at 1.0
   today), goal 1000 cc to 1500 cc negative today.
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   - Holding tube feeds in preparation of possible extubation.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: No change in fever curve. No new
   culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis.
   Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl.
   - Antibiotics currently: zosyn (zosyn started [**10-25**], vancomycin
   [**Date range (1) 2200**]), since enterococcous was sensitive to ampicillin, will plan
   to complete at least 14 day course (today is day 14, however only day
   12 since (+) blood cultures on [**10-27**]), will discuss possibly stopping to
   see if fever curve changes.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations. Held off on thoracentesis or
   additional imaging at present.  Will discuss today possibly adding
   antifungal coverage as per ID recs.
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 8).
   - Checking differential today given rising WBC
   - Will discuss other work-up, such as scanning sinuses (eg NG tube in
   place) today.
   - Rising platelet count (599 up from 100
s-200
s) could also be
   suggestive of infection (can also be seen with iron deficiency, but her
   iron studies were more consistent with anemia of chronic disease).
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Unable to check for bile in ascites as
   it has resolved, HIDA not felt to be helpful.
   - Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6 weeks.
   #) Anemia: Today patient
s HCT trended down slightly, from 23.1 to
   22.6. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not had any
   evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted on CT
   previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as well.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   - Given slow decline (as opposed to acute), will hold off on additional
   imaging of abdomen, but consider if continues to decline.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).
   .
   #) FEN: Tube feeds on hold for possible extubation.
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) to visit today, will plan
   to update them on progress. Per patient
s parents, updates should be
   relayed to patient
s father. [**Name (NI) 2051**] [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2017**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She is currently intubated and being weaned off sedation in preparation for extubation. The patient continues to have fevers and shows signs of infection, with ongoing blood cultures revealing gram-negative rods. Her respiratory status has improved, but she still requires assistance with breathing. The patient's pancreatitis appears to be stable, and there are no signs of abscess or other concerning pathology on imaging. Antibiotics have been started empirically and will be continued for a total of 14 days. The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease, and further evaluation is planned. There are no changes in her other medical conditions, including alcohol abuse, GERD, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she still requires assistance with breathing. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to factors such as abdominal distension, pleural effusions, and ongoing sedation. Close monitoring of her respiratory function and continued weaning attempts are necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and positive blood cultures indicate ongoing infection. The presence of gram-negative rods suggests a bacterial infection. Continued surveillance and management of infection through appropriate antibiotic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory failure: Over the weekend, patient did not do well with
   breathing trials, and in fact needed additional PEEP support. Imaging
   was completed yesterday to rule out PE or look for other reversible
   causes of hypoxia or inability to wean. At this time, need to start
   thinking about tracheostomy to wean patient from ventilator, and family
   will be in today for meeting to further discuss.
   - Currently patient is back on assist-control, appears comfortable,
   will plan to check ABG today
   - Patient responded well to haldol earlier today, and given concerns of
   possible confusion (and possibly ICU psychosis with her agitation), she
   may respond better to haldol
initiating TID standing Haldol with
   additional PRN dosing, will aim to wean versed and fentanyl in this
   setting. Checking EKG today to ensure QTc is okay with haldol use.
   - Will discuss with family and IP service tracheostomy today
   - Diuresis goal about 1 liter net negative today
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          No complications (hemorrhage, abscess, pseudocyst) noted on
   CT of abdomen from yesterday.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Persistent fevers overnight,
   higher to 102. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis. Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of
   flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which
   covered entercoccous in one blood
   - Given appearance on chest CT and fevers, yesterday cipro, zosyn, and
   vanco added (today is day 2) to flagyl
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 10).
   - Rising platelet count (today stable at 620, up from 100
s-200
   could also be suggestive of infection or acute phase reactant (can also
   be seen with iron deficiency, but her iron studies were more consistent
   with anemia of chronic disease).
   - Will follow up final read of CT sinuses, which suggested moderate
   disease. Vancomycin will provide additional gram positive coverage,
   while cipro will provide additional gram negative.
   - If continues to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider empiric anti-fungal coverage.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - Appreciate surgery assistance, will continue to follow abdominal
   examination, repeat imaging per surgery recommendations (since imaging
   was prior to removal of tube).
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator and requires additional PEEP support. This indicates a potential complication related to respiratory function.

2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis, suggesting an ongoing infection. The presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture and enterococcus in the blood culture further supports the possibility of a bacterial infection. Additionally, the patient's recent initiation of multiple antibiotics indicates an attempt to treat a suspected infection.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, which is an inflammation of the pancreas. The abdominal imaging shows inflammatory changes consistent with pancreatitis, although no hemorrhage or abscess is noted.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count was initially low (100-200) but has since improved to 620. This improvement could be due to the treatment of an underlying infection or an acute phase reactant.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but the cause is not clear. The iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease, and there is no evidence of bleeding or hemorrhagic component of pancreatitis.

6. Gallbladder issues: The patient has a distended, thickened gallbladder, likely secondary to irritation from pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who unfortunately did not tolerate a
   breathing trial this morning, and with continued fevers.
   #) Respiratory failure: Unfortunately patient did not tolerate
   breathing trial this morning, and sedation did not appear to be a
   factor. At this time, need to start thinking about tracheostomy to wean
   patient from ventilator if unable to find an intervenable reason for
   failure to wean (eg pneumonia or significant effusion not seen well on
   chest x-ray). No PE seen on CTA.
   - Patient was on [**Month/Day (1) **], however now approaching 24 hours on
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will need to switch back to versed and fentanyl (at lower
   doses) and use haldol as well for agitation. Will titrate down
   methadone from Q6H to Q8H.
   - Will discuss with family and IP service tracheostomy today
   - Diuresis goal about 1 liter net negative today
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          Given persistent fevers and fact that patient is now two
   weeks out from pancreatitis, will re-image abdomen while patient is
   getting chest CT to evaluate for potential source of infection.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Persistent fevers overnight. No
   new culture data. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis. Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of
   flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which
   covered entercoccous in one blood
   - Given appearance on chest CT and fevers, yesterday cipro, zosyn, and
   vanco added to flagyl (today is day 2)
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 9).
   - Rising platelet count (above 600 now, up from 100
s-200
s) could also
   be suggestive of infection or acute phase reactant (can also be seen
   with iron deficiency, but her iron studies were more consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease).
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Unable to check for bile in ascites as
   it has resolved, HIDA not felt to be helpful.
   -          Drain in place for now, plan is for cholecysectomy in 6
   weeks.
   -          CT abdomen today
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   - Given slow decline (as opposed to acute), will hold off on additional
   imaging of abdomen, but consider if continues to decline.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and remained intubated. She developed fevers, bacteremia, and leukocytosis, and multiple cultures were obtained. The patient was started on empirical treatment for suspected infection and her condition improved initially. However, she subsequently developed agitation and required increased sedation. The patient's platelet count has been rising, and she has been weaned off some sedatives. Imaging studies have shown moderate sinus disease, partial opacification of the left maxillary sinus, mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary, ethmoidal, sphenoid, and left frontal sinuses. A CT abdomen revealed pancreatitis without hemorrhage or abscess. The patient's anemia is stable, and she has not shown evidence of bleeding. She has been treated for possible gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving folate and thiamine supplementation. The patient's gallbladder appears thickened and distended, and a percutaneous drain was placed due to concern for cholangitis, although only bile was found. The patient is scheduled for cholecystectomy in six weeks. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and she has been placed back on assisted ventilation. She is also on prophylactic antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, c"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is a fever of 102.4, which started at 04:00 PM on [**2162-11-8**]. The patient also has a history of sputum production with Gram-negative rods (GNRs) observed on gram stain.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including moderate sinus disease with partial opacification of the left maxillary sinus, mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary, ethmoidal, sphenoid, and left frontal sinuses. There are also airspace opacities in the right lung apex, concerning for focal pneumonia. Additionally, there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis of the lung, which cannot be excluded as superimposed pneumonia. The CT abdomen shows continued inflammatory changes surrounding the pancreas, compatible with pancreatitis. There is also moderate gallbladder irregularity, with wall irregularity, pericholecystic fluid, and a pigtail catheter in place, likely reflecting continued inflammatory changes from adjacent pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 39.1°C (102.4°F), current temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 85 bpm with a range of 76-122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/66 mmHg to 136/84 mmH"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator, with gram negative bacteremia and
   resolution of fevers in last 24 hours.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient had not done well with breathing
   trials, and actually was hypoxic. Imaging was completed to rule out PE
   or look for other reversible causes of hypoxia or inability to wean.
   Yesterday family agreed to pursue trachestomy to help improve ability
   to wean patient and lessen sedation.
   - Currently patient is back on assist-control, appears comfortable,
   will leave on current settings until tracheostomy
   - Haldol TID standing, PRN for sedation, and will continue to wean
   versed and fentanyl
   - IP to place tracheostomy today or tomorrow, and PEG
   - Diuresis goal about [**2-3**] liter net negative today (especially given
   CXR appearance)
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          No complications (hemorrhage, abscess, pseudocyst) noted on
   CT of abdomen from this week.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis:
   Afebrile overnight!
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Imaging of abdomen had no revealed
   an abscess or other reason for fever. TTE negative for abscess or
   vegetation. Lines have been changed. Abdominal ultrasound revealed
   there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood culture.
   Overnight, culture data notable for gram negative rods in blood
   culture.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 11).
   - Fevers, leukocytosis, platelet count have all improved on cipro, and
   given gram negatives in sputum and blood, sputum this is likely reason
   for fever (VAP, also could be from gut translocation). Will continue
   cipro (day 3), discuss changing zosyn to other gram negative coverage
   given fevers while on zosyn. Will likely stop vancomycin.
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - Appreciate surgery assistance, will continue to follow abdominal
   examination, repeat imaging per surgery recommendations (will discuss
   with IR if surgery cannot rule out retained part of percutaneous drain.
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Patient
s INR has been slowly trended upward, suspect
   likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient was
   NPO, then only on TPN.
   Patient received vitamin K, will re-check in AM, transfuse FFPs if
   remains about 1.5 prior to tracheosomty. Low suspicion for DIC, but
   checking labs.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).
   .
   #) FEN: Holding tube feeds at midnight for trach
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) will be in today for
   meeting to discuss progress, further treatment. Mom [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**]. Will try to arrange family meeting for tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been experiencing persistent fevers, difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and gram-negative bacteremia. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is back on assist-control ventilation and appears comfortable. A tracheostomy is planned to improve the ability to wean her off the ventilator and reduce sedation.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is stable, with no complications such as hemorrhage, abscess, or pseudocyst noted on the recent CT scan of the abdomen. Tube feeds are continued.

3. Fevers, Bacteremia, Leukocytosis: The patient's fever has resolved overnight, and there is an improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis. Empiric treatment with ciprofloxacin has been started, and further ID recommendations are appreciated.

4. EtOH Abuse: The patient's last known drink was on October 24th. Sedation taper and transition are noted, along with folate and thiamine supplementation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory failure: Over the weekend, patient did not do well with
   breathing trials, and in fact needed additional PEEP support. Imaging
   was completed yesterday to rule out PE or look for other reversible
   causes of hypoxia or inability to wean. At this time, need to start
   thinking about tracheostomy to wean patient from ventilator, and family
   will be in today for meeting to further discuss.
   - Currently patient is back on assist-control, appears comfortable,
   will plan to check ABG today
   - Patient responded well to haldol earlier today, and given concerns of
   possible confusion (and possibly ICU psychosis with her agitation), she
   may respond better to haldol
initiating TID standing Haldol with
   additional PRN dosing, will aim to wean versed and fentanyl in this
   setting. Checking EKG today to ensure QTc is okay with haldol use.
   - Will discuss with family and IP service tracheostomy today
   - Diuresis goal about 1 liter net negative today
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          No complications (hemorrhage, abscess, pseudocyst) noted on
   CT of abdomen from yesterday.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Persistent fevers overnight,
   higher to 102. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis. Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of
   flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which
   covered entercoccous in one blood
   - Given appearance on chest CT and fevers, yesterday cipro, zosyn, and
   vanco added (today is day 2) to flagyl
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 10).
   - Rising platelet count (today stable at 620, up from 100
s-200
   could also be suggestive of infection or acute phase reactant (can also
   be seen with iron deficiency, but her iron studies were more consistent
   with anemia of chronic disease).
   - Will follow up final read of CT sinuses, which suggested moderate
   disease. Vancomycin will provide additional gram positive coverage,
   while cipro will provide additional gram negative.
   - If continues to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider empiric anti-fungal coverage.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - Appreciate surgery assistance, will continue to follow abdominal
   examination, repeat imaging per surgery recommendations (since imaging
   was prior to removal of tube).
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.

The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing and has had persistent fevers and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty in weaning from the ventilator suggests a high risk for respiratory failure. Further evaluation and intervention may be necessary.

2. Infection: The persistent fevers and leukocytosis indicate a possible ongoing infection. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, but the source of infection has not been fully identified. Cultures are pending, and it is important to consider additional coverage, especially for gram-negative organisms.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pseudocysts, hemorrhage, or abscess formation. Imaging studies will help monitor for these complications.

4. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Monitoring for symptoms such as agitation, tremors, and seizures is essential.

5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobility and hypercoagulable state due to alcohol abuse increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory failure: Over the weekend, patient did not do well with
   breathing trials, and in fact needed additional PEEP support. Imaging
   was completed yesterday to rule out PE or look for other reversible
   causes of hypoxia or inability to wean. At this time, need to start
   thinking about tracheostomy to wean patient from ventilator, and family
   will be in today for meeting to further discuss.
   - Currently patient is back on assist-control, appears comfortable,
   will plan to check ABG today
   - Patient responded well to haldol earlier today, and given concerns of
   possible confusion (and possibly ICU psychosis with her agitation), she
   may respond better to haldol
initiating TID standing Haldol with
   additional PRN dosing, will aim to wean versed and fentanyl in this
   setting. Checking EKG today to ensure QTc is okay with haldol use.
   - Will discuss with family and IP service tracheostomy today
   - Diuresis goal about 1 liter net negative today
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          No complications (hemorrhage, abscess, pseudocyst) noted on
   CT of abdomen from yesterday.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Persistent fevers overnight,
   higher to 102. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis. Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of
   flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which
   covered entercoccous in one blood
   - Given appearance on chest CT and fevers, yesterday cipro, zosyn, and
   vanco added (today is day 2) to flagyl
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 10).
   - Rising platelet count (today stable at 620, up from 100
s-200
   could also be suggestive of infection or acute phase reactant (can also
   be seen with iron deficiency, but her iron studies were more consistent
   with anemia of chronic disease).
   - Will follow up final read of CT sinuses, which suggested moderate
   disease. Vancomycin will provide additional gram positive coverage,
   while cipro will provide additional gram negative.
   - If continues to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider empiric anti-fungal coverage.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - Appreciate surgery assistance, will continue to follow abdominal
   examination, repeat imaging per surgery recommendations (since imaging
   was prior to removal of tube).
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).
   .
   #) FEN: Resuming tube feeds
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) will be in today for
   meeting to discuss progress, further treatment. Mom [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**]. Will try to arrange family meeting for tomorrow.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator.
   #) Respiratory failure: Over the weekend, patient did not do well with
   breathing trials, and in fact needed additional PEEP support. Imaging
   was completed yesterday to rule out PE or look for other reversible
   causes of hypoxia or inability to wean. At this time, need to start
   thinking about tracheostomy to wean patient from ventilator, and family
   will be in today for meeting to further discuss.
   - Currently patient is back on assist-control, appears comfortable,
   will plan to check ABG today
   - Patient responded well to haldol earlier today, and given concerns of
   possible confusion (and possibly ICU psychosis with her agitation), she
   may respond better to haldol
initiating TID standing Haldol with
   additional PRN dosing, will aim to wean versed and fentanyl in this
   setting. Checking EKG today to ensure QTc is okay with haldol use.
   - Will discuss with family and IP service tracheostomy today
   - Diuresis goal about 1 liter net negative today
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          No complications (hemorrhage, abscess, pseudocyst) noted on
   CT of abdomen from yesterday.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis: Persistent fevers overnight,
   higher to 102. She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], with culture data
   only revealing for enterococcous, presumably from gut translocation. CT
   and MRCP negative for abscess or other concerning pathology. TTE
   negative for abscess or vegetation. All lines have been changed or
   pulled. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not enough fluid for a
   paracentesis. Bandemia appeared to have improved since initiation of
   flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which
   covered entercoccous in one blood
   - Given appearance on chest CT and fevers, yesterday cipro, zosyn, and
   vanco added (today is day 2) to flagyl
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 10).
   - Rising platelet count (today stable at 620, up from 100
s-200
   could also be suggestive of infection or acute phase reactant (can also
   be seen with iron deficiency, but her iron studies were more consistent
   with anemia of chronic disease).
   - Will follow up final read of CT sinuses, which suggested moderate
   disease. Vancomycin will provide additional gram positive coverage,
   while cipro will provide additional gram negative.
   - If continues to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider empiric anti-fungal coverage.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - Appreciate surgery assistance, will continue to follow abdominal
   examination, repeat imaging per surgery recommendations (since imaging
   was prior to removal of tube).
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).
   .
   #) FEN: Resuming tube feeds
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) will be in today for
   meeting to discuss progress, further treatment. Mom [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**]. Will try to arrange family meeting for tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pancreatitis, fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis, and a distended gallbladder. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She has been experiencing persistent fevers and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's condition has been complicated by infections, including enterococcal bacteremia and pneumonia. She has also been diagnosed with alcohol abuse and pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on assist-control ventilation and is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator. There is a need to consider tracheostomy to facilitate weaning and prevent respiratory failure.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis secondary to high triglycerides and alcohol abuse. She is stable, but there is a risk of complications such as hemorrhage, abscess formation, or pseudocyst development.
3. Infections: The patient has persistent fevers and bacteremia caused by enterococcus. She is being treated with antibiotics, but there is a risk of developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which may contribute to her current condition and increase the risk of"

   Laboraotry Data:
   [**11-9**] Blood culture: Gram negative rods x1, other culture NGTD
   Otherwise no new culture data
   Imaging:
   [**11-10**] Chest X-ray pending, appears more fluid overloaded that prior
   [**11-9**] KUB pending, no evidence of residual drain noted
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator, with gram negative bacteremia and
   resolution of fevers in last 24 hours.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient had not done well with breathing
   trials, and actually was hypoxic. Imaging was completed to rule out PE
   or look for other reversible causes of hypoxia or inability to wean.
   Yesterday family agreed to pursue trachestomy to help improve ability
   to wean patient and lessen sedation.
   - Currently patient is back on assist-control, appears comfortable,
   will leave on current settings until tracheostomy
   - Haldol TID standing, PRN for sedation, and will continue to wean
   versed and fentanyl
   - IP to place tracheostomy today or tomorrow, and PEG
   - Diuresis goal about [**2-3**] liter net negative today (especially given
   CXR appearance)
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          No complications (hemorrhage, abscess, pseudocyst) noted on
   CT of abdomen from this week.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis:
   Afebrile overnight!
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Imaging of abdomen had no revealed
   an abscess or other reason for fever. TTE negative for abscess or
   vegetation. Lines have been changed. Abdominal ultrasound revealed
   there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 11).
   - Fevers, leukocytosis, platelet count have all improved on cipro, and
   given gram negatives in sputum and blood, sputum this is likely reason
   for fever (VAP, also could be from gut translocation). Will continue
   cipro (day 3), discuss changing zosyn to other gram negative coverage
   given fevers while on zosyn. Will likely stop vancomycin.
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - Appreciate surgery assistance, will continue to follow abdominal
   examination, repeat imaging per surgery recommendations (since imaging
   was prior to removal of tube).
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).
   .
   #) FEN: Resuming tube feeds
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   .
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father) will be in today for
   meeting to discuss progress, further treatment. Mom [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**]. Will try to arrange family meeting for tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pancreatitis, fevers, and bacteremia. The patient has been intubated and sedated, but has not been able to wean off the ventilator due to hypoxia. Her condition has been complicated by a distended gallbladder, anemia, GERD, and a tracheostomy/PEG tube placement planned. She has had persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and bandemia, which improved after starting ciprofloxacin and flagyl. The patient's labs and imaging studies are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator may lead to further respiratory failure, requiring ongoing respiratory support.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to complications such as hemorrhagic pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, or pseudocyst formation.
3. Infection: The patient's history of fevers, bacteremia, and leukocytosis suggests a high risk of infection. Bacterial sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) could develop, requiring prompt recognition and treatment.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia could progress, leading to increased risk of bleeding, especially if there is ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding or platelet dysfunction.
5. Gallbladder Complications: The patient's distended gallbladder may lead to cholecystitis or gallstone-related complications, potentially requiring surgical intervention.
6. Tracheostomy/PEG Tube Complications: Complications related to the tracheostomy and PEG tube placement, such as bleeding, infection, or displacement, could occur during or after the procedure.
7. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse increases the risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can be prevented with appropriate management.
8. Other Complications: The patient's multiple comorbidities and critical condition increase the risk of other complications, including thromboembolism, delirium, or organ dysfunction."

[**11-10**] [**Month/Day (4) 2539**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of retained foreign body.
[**11-11**] Chest X-ray final read pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator, with blood cultures notable for
   gram positive cocci and gram variable rods.
   #) Respiratory failure: Given difficulty weaning from ventilator,
   patient to go for tracheostomy today.
   - Haldol TID standing, PRN for sedation, after tracheostomy will
   attempt to wean down sedation
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc (patient is LOS
   about 1 L positive, however expect that much of the fluid has
   redistributed and she has lost significant muscle mass)
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis:
   Patient with fevers overnight to 101-102. New culture data as noted
   above.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Imaging of abdomen had no revealed
   an abscess or other reason for fever. TTE negative for abscess or
   vegetation. Lines have been changed. Abdominal ultrasound revealed
   there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x3. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 12).
   - Given sensitivities above, will continue cipro (day 4), meropenem
   (day 2) for VAP. Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood
   cultures (although may be able to narrow based on ID recommendations).
   - Will aim to d/c PICC line today, place peripherals for at least next
   24 hours.
   - Will likely pursue thoracentesis of right side given persistent
   effusion and VAP, for both diagnostic purposes and possible therapeutic
   purposes (to help wean from vent)
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - No evidence of retained object on [**Last Name (LF) 2539**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to discuss further
   with surgery removal of suture material as this continues to serve as
   portal of infection.
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN.
   .
   #) GERD: PO PPI
   .
   #) FEN: Tube
   feeds

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient has had persistent fevers and bacteremia, with blood cultures showing gram-positive cocci and gram-variable rods. Imaging of the abdomen revealed no abscess or other reason for fever, and a thoracentesis was performed to drain pleural effusion. 

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, methadone, heparin sodium, lasix, haloperidol, lansoprazole, ciprofloxacin, lactulose, miconazole powder, tylenol, meropenem, and flagyl. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 to 114/69 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 86 to 117 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.1. The blood cultures indicate resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, gentamicin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, but sensitivity to cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, tobramycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. 

The patient's imaging studies show no evidence of retained foreign body in the percutaneous cholecystotomy tube. The chest X-ray is pending final read. 

The patient's plan includes tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from the ventilator, continued treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia with ciprofloxacin and meropenem, and continuation of vancomycin for gram-positive blood cultures. The patient's PICC line will be removed, and additional peripheral lines will be placed. A thoracentesis will be performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The patient's sedation will be tapered, and transition will be made to a tracheostomy. 

The patient's other medical issues include alcohol abuse, distended and thickened gallbladder, anemia, elevated INR, GERD, and pancreatitis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator, with gram negative bacteremia and
   resolution of fevers in last 24 hours.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient had not done well with breathing
   trials, and actually was hypoxic. Imaging was completed to rule out PE
   or look for other reversible causes of hypoxia or inability to wean.
   Yesterday family agreed to pursue trachestomy to help improve ability
   to wean patient and lessen sedation.
   - Currently patient is back on assist-control, appears comfortable,
   will leave on current settings until tracheostomy
   - Haldol TID standing, PRN for sedation, and will continue to wean
   versed and fentanyl
   - IP to place tracheostomy today or tomorrow, and PEG
   - Diuresis goal about [**2-3**] liter net negative today (especially given
   CXR appearance)
   .
   #) Pancreatitis: Stable, no pain. Suspected to be secondary to high
   triglycerides, alcohol use. Also possible that patient could have
   passed stone given dilated CBD, but none have been seen on imaging.  CT
   scan consistent with pancreatitis, no hemorrhage or abscess seen.
   Patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and has been stable as far
   as pancreatitis is concerned.
   -          No complications (hemorrhage, abscess, pseudocyst) noted on
   CT of abdomen from this week.
   -          Continuing tube feeds.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis:
   Afebrile overnight!
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Imaging of abdomen had no revealed
   an abscess or other reason for fever. TTE negative for abscess or
   vegetation. Lines have been changed. Abdominal ultrasound revealed
   there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood culture.
   Overnight, culture data notable for gram negative rods in blood
   culture.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x2. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 11).
   - Fevers, leukocytosis, platelet count have all improved on cipro, and
   given gram negatives in sputum and blood, sputum this is likely reason
   for fever (VAP, also could be from gut translocation). Will continue
   cipro (day 3), discuss changing zosyn to other gram negative coverage
   given fevers while on zosyn. Will likely stop vancomycin.
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - Appreciate surgery assistance, will continue to follow abdominal
   examination, repeat imaging per surgery recommendations (will discuss
   with IR if surgery cannot rule out retained part of percutaneous drain.
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Patient
s INR has been slowly trended upward, suspect
   likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient was
   NPO, then only on TPN.
   Patient received vitamin K, will re-check in AM, transfuse FFPs if
   remains about 1.5 prior to tracheosomty. Low suspicion for DIC, but
   checking labs.
   .
   #) GERD: Change to PO PPI (no evidence of bleeding).
   .
   #) FEN: Holding tube feeds at midnight for trach
   .
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   .
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to increased work of breathing and has been intubated. The patient had persistent fevers and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The patient's condition improved after changing antibiotics and increasing sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not respond well to tracheostomy and continues to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to complications such as hemorrhage, abscess, or pseudocyst formation.
3. Bacteremia and Fevers: The presence of gram-negative rods in the blood culture indicates bacteremia. If the infection spreads or if the patient does not respond to the current antibiotic treatment, it could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Alcohol Abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse increases the risk of complications such as liver damage or liver failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she continues to lose blood due to phlebotomy or if there are ongoing bleeding complications.
6. Elevated INR: The patient's increased INR may indicate a risk of bleeding, especially if it remains elevated prior to the tracheostomy"

   a
   plastic surgery consult for further evaluation. Moderate bilateral
   pleural
   effusions with associated atelectasis. NG tube in place. Mild pelvic
   fluid
   which appears simple. Heterogeneous gall bladder not significantly
   changed
   in size compared to 3 days ago. No intra-abdominal abscess.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy yesterday, with
   bacteremia.
   #) Respiratory failure: Given difficulty weaning from ventilator,
   patient went for tracheostomy yesterday. This morning during rounds she
   did well with breathing trial, maintaining adequate minute ventilation
   and oxygenation.
   - Haldol TID standing, PRN for sedation. Fentanyl and versed have been
   weaned down considerably, but will need to continue to wean as cannot
   maintain if patient is on trach mask. Will discuss additional weaning
   with pharmacy (eg PO valium or fentanyl boluses) as wish to avoid
   withdrawal from narcotics/benzodiazepam agents. QTc has been stable on
   haldol, following daily.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc (patient is LOS
   about 1 L positive, however expect that much of the fluid has
   redistributed and she has lost significant muscle mass)
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - Given difficulty weaning sedation and concern for patient safety,
   obtaining 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her
   lines and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since
   this has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV if she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   This morning, temperature of 100, otherwise no fever since >24 hours.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT yesterday. Bandemia appeared to have improved since
   initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn
   ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   CT yesterday was negative for any new acute process (as there had been
   no imaging since patient pulled out percutaneous drain).
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Given initial significant improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis,
   will continue treatment course of 14 days (today is day 13), tomorrow
   will be last day.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, will stop ciprofloxacin given that
   klebsiella is very sensitive to meropenem (day 3) for VAP. Will
   continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures until further
   speciation completed (although may be able to narrow based on ID
   recommendations).
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Current unresolved issue is that
   of the retained suture material. Her cholecystitis has been felt to be
   related to edema from her pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on
   repeated imaging. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of
   concern for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since
   pulled out the percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been
   deemed necessary.
   -          Appreciate surgery assistance. Given KUB and CT without
   evidence of retained foreign object, will discuss with surgery whether
   suture material can be removed or trimmed close to skin. If surgery
   team unable to do this, will discuss appropriate next steps (IR or
   additional imaging).
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was transferred from another facility for pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is currently intubated. She has bacteremia and fevers, and there is suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's lines have been changed, and the PICC line was removed due to infection concerns. There is a concern about retained suture material in the gallbladder, which needs to be addressed. The patient's anemia is stable, and she has received folate and thiamine supplementation. Her elevated INR is thought to be due to nutritional deficiencies. The patient requires sedation tapering and transition, and she has been weaned down from fentanyl and versed. There is a need for additional weaning strategies to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The patient's family has been updated on her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator: The patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator, which could lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lung complications.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is suspected to have VAP, which is a type of lung infection commonly seen in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for Trach/PEG placement and possible bronchoscope. The patient has a history of fever, with the highest temperature recorded at 102.1°F (Tmax: 38.9°C). The patient's heart rate is within normal range, but their blood pressure is on the lower side. The respiratory rate is within normal range, and the oxygen saturation is at 96%. The patient has undergone several procedures, including percutaneous tracheostomy, PICC line placement, and central line placement. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,421 mL and output of 2,835 mL. The patient's blood cultures have shown various organisms, including Klebsiella, gram-positive cocci, Bacillus species, and NGTD. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. The patient's liver enzymes are within normal range, while the creatinine level is slightly elevated. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's glucose level is well-controlled. Imaging studies reveal moderate bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, mild pelvic fluid, heterogeneous gallbladder, and no intra-abdominal abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and positive blood cultures suggest a possible infection. The presence of different organisms in the blood"

   Note - extravasation of contrast into arm, approx 150 cc, at IV site
   confirmed
   with scan of arm. This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] who will obtain
   a
   plastic surgery consult for further evaluation. Moderate bilateral
   pleural
   effusions with associated atelectasis. NG tube in place. Mild pelvic
   fluid
   which appears simple. Heterogeneous gall bladder not significantly
   changed
   in size compared to 3 days ago. No intra-abdominal abscess.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, who has had persistent fevers and
   difficulty weaning from ventilator, with blood cultures notable for
   gram positive cocci and gram variable rods.
   #) Respiratory failure: Given difficulty weaning from ventilator,
   patient to go for tracheostomy today.
   - Haldol TID standing, PRN for sedation, after tracheostomy will
   attempt to wean down sedation
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc (patient is LOS
   about 1 L positive, however expect that much of the fluid has
   redistributed and she has lost significant muscle mass)
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia, leukocytosis:
   Patient with fevers overnight to 101-102. New culture data as noted
   above.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Imaging of abdomen had no revealed
   an abscess or other reason for fever. TTE negative for abscess or
   vegetation. Lines have been changed. Abdominal ultrasound revealed
   there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data including c. diff.
started empiric
   treatment on [**11-1**], stool negative x3. Given initial significant
   improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis, will continue treatment
   course of 14 days (today is day 12).
   - Given sensitivities above, will continue cipro (day 4), meropenem
   (day 2) for VAP. Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood
   cultures (although may be able to narrow based on ID recommendations).
   - Will aim to d/c PICC line today, place peripherals for at least next
   24 hours.
   - Will likely pursue thoracentesis of right side given persistent
   effusion and VAP, for both diagnostic purposes and possible therapeutic
   purposes (to help wean from vent)
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: No change in management. Based on
   imaging, appears that her cholecystitis was likely secondary to
   irritation from her pancreatitis. No stones have been seen on imaging
   at OSH or here. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern
   for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. It is possible she passed
   stone given dilated duct noted. Patient pulled out percutaneous drain
   overnight, and surgery aware and will follow, no acute interventions
   felt necessary overnight. Read of repeat CT abdomen as noted above.
   - No evidence of retained object on [**Last Name (LF) 2539**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to discuss further
   with surgery removal of suture material as this continues to serve as
   portal of infection.
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy yesterday, with
   bacteremia.
   #) Respiratory failure: Given difficulty weaning from ventilator,
   patient went for tracheostomy yesterday. This morning during rounds she
   did well with breathing trial, maintaining adequate minute ventilation
   and oxygenation.
   - Haldol TID standing, PRN for sedation. Fentanyl and versed have been
   weaned down considerably, but will need to continue to wean as cannot
   maintain if patient is on trach mask. Will discuss additional weaning
   with pharmacy (eg PO valium or fentanyl boluses) as wish to avoid
   withdrawal from narcotics/benzodiazepam agents. QTc has been stable on
   haldol, following daily.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc (patient is LOS
   about 1 L positive, however expect that much of the fluid has
   redistributed and she has lost significant muscle mass)
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - Given difficulty weaning sedation and concern for patient safety,
   obtaining 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her
   lines and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since
   this has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV if she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   This morning, temperature of 100, otherwise no fever since >24 hours.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT yesterday. Bandemia appeared to have improved since
   initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn
   ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   CT yesterday was negative for any new acute process (as there had been
   no imaging since patient pulled out percutaneous drain).
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Given initial significant improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis,
   will continue treatment course of 14 days (today is day 14), tomorrow
   will be last day.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, will stop ciprofloxacin given that
   klebsiella is very sensitive to meropenem (day 4) for VAP. Will
   continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures until further
   speciation completed (although may be able to narrow based on ID
   recommendations).
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Current unresolved issue is that
   of the retained suture material. Her cholecystitis has been felt to be
   related to edema from her pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on
   repeated imaging. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of
   concern for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since
   pulled out the percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been
   deemed necessary.
   -          Appreciate surgery assistance. Given KUB and CT without
   evidence of retained foreign object, will discuss with surgery whether
   suture material can be removed or trimmed close to skin. If surgery
   team unable to do this, will discuss appropriate next steps (IR or
   additional imaging).
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, fevers, and bacteremia. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has completed a 14-day course of piperacillin/tazobactam for bacteremia, and her bandemia has improved. Imaging shows evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is being treated with meropenem. The patient's sedation is being weaned, and she is receiving folate and thiamine supplementation. A retained suture material in the gallbladder is still unresolved, and the surgical team is assisting with this issue. The patient's anemia is stable, and her INR has been stable since receiving Vitamin K. She is receiving tube feeds and PPI for GERD. The patient's code status is full code, and her family has been updated on her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's difficulty in weaning from the ventilator indicates a risk of ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's imaging suggests VAP, which can lead to worsening lung infection and potential sepsis.
3. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient's persistent fevers and bacteremia indicate an ongoing infection that needs to be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including but not limited to sepsis, pneumonia, and a history of substance abuse. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission and has required several boluses of sedation around 8 pm. There have been some difficulties in placing a peripheral IV line, with a PICC line being attempted but not successful due to poor access. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole, as well as other medications for pain management, agitation, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Line infections: The difficulty in placing peripheral IV lines and the unsuccessful attempt at a PICC line could increase the risk of line infections, particularly if alternative sites are used.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI): The use of central lines for prolonged periods can increase the risk of CRBSI.
4. Delirium: The patient has required several boluses of sedation around 8 pm, suggesting potential agitation or delirium.
5. Nosocomial infections: Given the prolonged stay in the ICU, the patient is at risk of developing nosocomial infections such as urinary tract infections or"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient is now status-post tracheostomy after
   difficulty weaning. She did well on PS trials yesterday, however has
   been intermittently agitated which has limited ability to further wean.
   - Discussed strategy for weaning sedation and minimizing risk of
   withdrawal from narcotics and benzodiazepines, and will increase haldol
   to 3 mg TID standing, given she has a good response to this, and
   uptitrate if needed so that PRNs are minimized. Continuing valium 10 mg
   PO TID, and will plan to go up further if needed to wean versed once
   she is on a stable haldol dose. Fentanyl patch should begin to take
   effect later today or tomorrow, so will wean fentanyl as tolerated at
   that time. Continuing methadone as well, will aim to further titrate
   that down once above interventions made. Following daily QTc given
   haldol and methadone can both prolong this.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV if she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   Overall fever curve appears to be improving.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT this week. Bandemia appeared to have improved since
   initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn
   ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem (day 5) for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures until
   further speciation completed (called lab this morning)
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation taper and
   transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine supplementation. Social
   work consult once extubated.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week. No evidence of bleeding currently, and
   she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her
   pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at
   least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging
   study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   .
   #) Eosinophilia: Noted on today

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is now status-post tracheostomy. The patient has been intermittently agitated, limiting the ability to further wean sedation. The plan is to increase haloperidol to 3 mg TID and uptitrate as needed, continue valium 10 mg PO TID, and wean versed once the patient is on a stable haloperidol dose. The fentanyl patch should begin to take effect later today or tomorrow, allowing for weaning of fentanyl as tolerated. Methadone will be continued and further titrated down once the above interventions are made. The goal is to achieve a daily urine output of 500-1000cc. Treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is ongoing, and a 1:1 sitter will be assigned to help re-orient the patient and ensure the safety of her lines and tracheostomy. A speech consult will be arranged for assistance with tracheostomy speaking if the patient tolerates the tracheostomy mask. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitated intubation and tracheostomy. There is a risk of continued difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation due to agitation.
2. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy yesterday, with
   bacteremia.
   #) Respiratory failure: Given difficulty weaning from ventilator,
   patient went for tracheostomy yesterday. This morning during rounds she
   did well with breathing trial, maintaining adequate minute ventilation
   and oxygenation.
   - Haldol TID standing, PRN for sedation. Will consider increasing dose
   to allow for wean of narcotics/benzo's. Will discuss additional weaning
   with pharmacy (eg PO valium or fentanyl boluses) as wish to avoid
   withdrawal from narcotics/benzodiazepam agents. QTc has been stable on
   haldol, following daily.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc (patient is LOS
   about 1 L positive, however expect that much of the fluid has
   redistributed and she has lost significant muscle mass)
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - Given difficulty weaning sedation and concern for patient safety,
   obtaining 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her
   lines and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since
   this has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV if she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   This morning, temperature of 100, otherwise no fever since >24 hours.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT yesterday. Bandemia appeared to have improved since
   initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn
   ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   CT yesterday was negative for any new acute process (as there had been
   no imaging since patient pulled out percutaneous drain).
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Given initial significant improvement in bandemia and leukocytosis,
   will continue treatment course of 14 days (today is day 14), tomorrow
   will be last day.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, will stop ciprofloxacin given that
   klebsiella is very sensitive to meropenem (day 4) for VAP. Will
   continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures until further
   speciation completed (although may be able to narrow based on ID
   recommendations).
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**].
   -          Sedation taper and transition as noted above.
   -          Folate and thiamine supplementation.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder: Current unresolved issue is that
   of the retained suture material. Her cholecystitis has been felt to be
   related to edema from her pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on
   repeated imaging. At OSH, a percutaneous drain was placed out of
   concern for possible cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since
   pulled out the percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been
   deemed necessary.
   -          Appreciate surgery assistance. Given KUB and CT without
   evidence of retained foreign object, will discuss with surgery whether
   suture material can be removed or trimmed close to skin. If surgery
   team unable to do this, will discuss appropriate next steps (IR or
   additional imaging).
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable. No evidence of bleeding currently, and she has not
   had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her pancreatitis noted
   on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at least a small role as
   well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.

   Imaging:
   Chest x-ray from [**11-13**] PM: No interval change.
   Chest x-ray from [**11-14**]: Read pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient is now status-post tracheostomy after
   difficulty weaning. Yesterday she did not do well with a spontaneous
   breathing trial.
   - Haldol appeared to work well yesterday with improvement during the
   day in regards to her agitation. Given that the patient tends to become
   more agitated and restless overnight, will increase PM haldol dose to
   10 mg, and give Q6H dosing of 5 mg during the day. Continuing valium 10
   mg PO TID, and will plan to go up further if needed to wean versed once
   she is on a stable haldol dose (today making additional adjustments).
   Continuing fentanyl patch, and will aim to wean versed by 20% today
   (down to 4). Following daily QTc given haldol and methadone can both
   prolong this.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV once she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   - Will attempt SBT/PS tomorrow after 24 hours of improved behavior
   control.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   Continues to have intermittent low grade temperatures (100), but as
   noted yesterday, fever curve appears to be improving.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT completed last week. Bandemia appeared to have
   improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of
   zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem (day 7) for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures which were
   coagulase negative staph until sensitivities return. Given that she has
   had two positive cultures, cannot solely attribute this to
   contamination, however surveillance cultures have been negative. Prior
   TTE was negative, but will need to consider repeat if patient remains
   febrile or additional culture return positive.
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation taper and
   transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine supplementation. Social
   work consult once extubated.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week. No evidence of bleeding currently, and
   she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her
   pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at
   least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging
   study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   .
   #) Eosinophilia: Noted on today
s labs. Mild, will continue to monitor
   trend, could be related to medications (meropenem is new).
   .
   #) GERD: PO PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a tracheostomy and has been having periods of agitation. She did not tolerate a spontaneous breathing trial yesterday but was placed back on assisted control mode.
2. Fevers and bacteremia: The patient has had intermittent low-grade temperatures, but her fever curve appears to be improving. She has been febrile since [Date range (1) 2161] and has undergone several investigations including TTE, line changes, and imaging studies. Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci speciated as coag-negative Staphylococcus.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has imaging consistent with VAP and has completed a 14-day course of empiric antibiotics (zosyn) covering enterococcus. Klebsiella in sputum is very sensitive to meropenem, and ciprofloxacin has been stopped.
4. Alcohol abuse: The patient's last known drink was on October 24th. Sedation taper and transition are ongoing. Folate and thiamine supplementation have been initiated, and a social work consult will be arranged once she is extubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. Recent events include a pressure support trial that resulted in hypoxia, an episode of hypoxia that resolved without intervention, and an additional dose of IV lasix to aid diuresis. The patient's allergies include codeine, and their last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and meropenem. The patient is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and haloperidol.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 116/59 to 143/92 mmHg, heart rate between 78 and 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 13 and 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,432 mL with 534 mL going into the total fluid, 407 mL going into the TF (total fluid), and 1,820 mL going into IV fluids. Output includes 2,740 mL of total output, 1,710 mL of urine output, and a negative balance of 308 mL.

The patient is on a ventilator with settings including Vt set at 450 mL, PS at 5 cmH2O, RR set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, PIP at 14 cmH2O, and plateau pressure at 20 cmH2O. ABG results show a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2 of 102 mmHg.

Physical examination findings are not provided. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests including elevated creatinine and lactic acid levels. The patient has a history of respiratory distress and has been on multiple antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The chest x-ray from 11/13 shows no interval change, but the one from 11/14 is pending.

2. Nosocomial infection: Given the prolonged ICU stay and the use of multiple antibiotics, there is a risk of developing a nosocomial infection. Blood cultures from 11/8 and 11/9 grew coag-negative staphylococci.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of AKI. The fluid balance also shows a negative balance, which may contribute to renal dysfunction.

4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic heparin sodium is being administered to reduce this risk.

6. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and use of multiple medications increase the risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient is now status-post tracheostomy after
   difficulty weaning. She did well on PS trials yesterday, however has
   been intermittently agitated which has limited ability to further wean.
   - Discussed strategy for weaning sedation and minimizing risk of
   withdrawal from narcotics and benzodiazepines, and will increase haldol
   to 3 mg TID standing, given she has a good response to this, and
   uptitrate if needed so that PRNs are minimized. Continuing valium 10 mg
   PO TID, and will plan to go up further if needed to wean versed once
   she is on a stable haldol dose. Fentanyl patch should begin to take
   effect later today or tomorrow, so will wean fentanyl as tolerated at
   that time. Continuing methadone as well, will aim to further titrate
   that down once above interventions made. Following daily QTc given
   haldol and methadone can both prolong this.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV if she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   Overall fever curve appears to be improving.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT this week. Bandemia appeared to have improved since
   initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of zosyn
   ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem (day 6) for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures--?
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation taper and
   transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine supplementation. Social
   work consult once extubated.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week. No evidence of bleeding currently, and
   she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her
   pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at
   least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging
   study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   .
   #) Eosinophilia: Noted on today

The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient has been experiencing periods of agitation, making it difficult to wean off sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, fevers, bacteremia, and suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including tracheostomy, diuresis, sedation weaning, and antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to her agitation and risk of withdrawal from narcotics and benzodiazepines.

2. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient has had persistent fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Despite line changes and completion of a 14-day course of antibiotics, the fever curve appears to be improving, but the source of infection is still unclear.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Imaging and sputum cultures have confirmed the presence of VAP, specifically klebsiella pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics, such as meropenem, have been initiated based on sensitivity results.

4. Alcohol Abuse: The patient's last known drink was on [**10-24**]. Tapering of sedation and transition to alcohol-free medications are ongoing. Folate and thiamine supplementation are also being provided. A social work consult will be arranged once the patient is extubated"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient is now status-post tracheostomy after
   difficulty weaning. Saturday she did not do well with a spontaneous
   breathing trial.
   - Haldol appeared to work well with improvement during the day in
   regards to her agitation. Given that the patient tends to become more
   agitated and restless overnight, increased PM haldol dose to 10 mg, and
   give Q6H dosing of 5 mg during the day. Continuing valium 10 mg PO TID,
   and will plan to go up further if needed to wean versed once she is on
   a stable haldol dose (today making additional adjustments). Continuing
   fentanyl patch, and will aim to wean versed by 20% today (down to 4).
   Following daily QTc given haldol and methadone can both prolong this.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV once she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   - Will attempt SBT/PS tomorrow after 24 hours of improved behavior
   control.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   Continues to have intermittent low grade temperatures (100), but as
   noted yesterday, fever curve appears to be improving.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT completed last week. Bandemia appeared to have
   improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of
   zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem (day 7) for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures which were
   coagulase negative staph until sensitivities return. Given that she has
   had two positive cultures, cannot solely attribute this to
   contamination, however surveillance cultures have been negative. Prior
   TTE was negative, but will need to consider repeat if patient remains
   febrile or additional culture return positive.
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation taper and
   transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine supplementation. Social
   work consult once extubated.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week. No evidence of bleeding currently, and
   she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her
   pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at
   least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging
   study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   .
   #) Eosinophilia: Noted on today
s labs. Mild, will continue to monitor
   trend, could be related to medications (meropenem is new).
   .
   #) GERD: PO PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. The patient also has fevers, bacteremia, a distended gallbladder, anemia, elevated INR, eosinophilia, GERD, and is receiving tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to increased work of breathing. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
2. Fevers and bacteremia: The patient has had persistent low-grade fevers, indicating an ongoing infection. Bacteremia has been present, and there is a concern for VAP. Appropriate antibiotics have been administered, but the patient remains febrile.
3. Distended gallbladder: The patient has a distended, thickened gallbladder, likely secondary to edema from pancreatitis. This may lead to complications such as cholecystitis or cholangitis if not managed properly.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of her anemia. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, and DIC labs have been ordered.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's INR has trended"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 131/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, with slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Other lab values appear within normal ranges. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and cultures should be done to prevent and detect this condition early.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient is now status-post tracheostomy after
   difficulty weaning. Saturday she did not do well with a spontaneous
   breathing trial.
   - Haldol appeared to work well with improvement during the day in
   regards to her agitation. Given that the patient tends to become more
   agitated and restless overnight, increased PM haldol dose to 10 mg, and
   give Q6H dosing of 5 mg during the day. Continuing valium 10 mg PO TID,
   and will plan to go up further if needed to wean versed once she is on
   a stable haldol dose (today making additional adjustments). Continuing
   fentanyl patch, and will aim to wean versed by 20% today (down to 4).
   Following daily QTc given haldol and methadone can both prolong this.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV once she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   - [**6-7**] trial today.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   Continues to have intermittent low grade temperatures (100), but as
   noted yesterday, fever curve appears to be improving.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT completed last week. Bandemia appeared to have
   improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of
   zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures which were
   coagulase negative staph until sensitivities return. Given that she has
   had two positive cultures, cannot solely attribute this to
   contamination, however surveillance cultures have been negative. Prior
   TTE was negative, but will need to consider repeat if patient remains
   febrile or additional culture return positive.
   - PLAN: Vanco for 14 day total course (Staph bacteremia) + Meropenem
   for 8 day total course (Klebs)
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation taper and
   transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine supplementation. Social
   work consult once more awake and on PMV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week. No evidence of bleeding currently, and
   she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her
   pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at
   least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging
   study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   .
   #) Eosinophilia: Noted on today
s labs. Mild, will continue to monitor
   trend, could be related to medications (meropenem is new).

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, fevers, and bacteremia. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy in place. The patient has been experiencing agitation and restlessness, particularly at night, and has been on various medications to manage her symptoms. She also has elevated liver function tests and evidence of gallbladder edema. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia and has had multiple positive blood cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty weaning from the ventilator and the presence of a tracheostomy indicate ongoing respiratory support needs.
2. Fevers and bacteremia: The patient continues to have intermittent low-grade temperatures, suggesting an ongoing infection. The presence of positive blood cultures indicates bacteremia, which needs to be treated appropriately.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, and the imaging is consistent with this diagnosis. Treatment for VAP includes changing antibiotics based on sensitivity results and maintaining proper hydration and nutrition.
4. Agitation and restlessness: The patient's agitation and restlessness, especially at night, require ongoing management with sedatives and antipsychotic medications. Monitoring for any side effects of these medications is important.
5. Elevated liver function tests: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient is now status-post tracheostomy after
   difficulty weaning. Diuresed yesterday with good results. More
   comfortable this AM. Will trial T-piece with PS 0.
   - Discussed strategy for weaning sedation and minimizing risk of
   withdrawal from narcotics and benzodiazepines, and will increase haldol
   to 5 mg [**Hospital1 7**] standing, 10mg at bedtime - which has worked well.
   Continuing valium 10 mg PO TID, and will plan to go up further if
   needed to wean versed once she is on a stable haldol dose. Fentanyl
   patch in place. Continuing methadone as well, will aim to further
   titrate that down once above interventions made. Following daily QTc
   given haldol and methadone can both prolong this.
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV if she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   Overall fever curve appears to be improving.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**] but afebrile today.  Work up has
   included a TTE which was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have
   been changed and PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound
   revealed there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and
   again this was consistent with CT this week. Bandemia appeared to have
   improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of
   zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem (day 6) for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures--?
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation taper and
   transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine supplementation. Social
   work consult once extubated.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week. No evidence of bleeding currently, and
   she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic component of her
   pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is likely playing at
   least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage on repeat imaging
   study.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs all checked, iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease, B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR and is stable. She has received
   Vitamin K.
   .
   #) Eosinophilia: Noted on today
s labs. Mild, will continue to monitor
   trend, could be related to medications (meropenem is new).

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, fevers, and bacteremia. She underwent intubation and tracheostomy due to increased work of breathing and has been sedated. The patient's recent progress includes improvement in her respiratory status with diuresis, increased comfort, and agitation. She has been weaned off sedatives and narcotics with the use of Haldol to minimize withdrawal symptoms. The patient's current goals include continued diuresis, weaning from the ventilator, and treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, requiring intubation and tracheostomy. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the weaning process fails or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient had persistent fevers and bacteremia, indicating an ongoing infection. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly to prevent further complications.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's imaging and sputum culture suggest VAP. If not treated effectively, this can lead to worsening respiratory status and potentially lead to sepsis or septic shock.

4. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a"

   Imaging: Today's CXR
   Yest CXR:
   The tracheostomy tip is at the midline, approximately 3 cm above the
   carina.
   The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The right PICC line tip can be
   followed
   till the level of mid SVC - pulled back?. There is interval increase in
   bilateral perihilar predominantly interstitial opacities suggesting
   developed
   interstitial pulmonary edema, mild to moderate. Bilateral pleural
   effusions
   are present, unchanged accompanied by bibasal atelectasis, left more
   than
   right.
   Microbiology: [**2162-11-14**] blood cx pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure:
    - Weaned to facemask
   - Discontinued fent/versed gtts, on fent patch at 150mcg/hour
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be recering from VAP slowly. Cont to wean off trach mask
   Continuing to wean sedation from prior team
s plan:
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - PMV trial today
   - repeat ABG today
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], now only low-grade temps.. Work up
   has included a TTE which was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines
   have been changed and PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound
   revealed there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and
   again this was consistent with CT completed last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - continues with low-grade temps.
   - WBC trending back down from 13.9.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures which were
   coagulase negative staph until sensitivities return. Given that she has
   had two positive cultures, cannot solely attribute this to
   contamination, however surveillance cultures have been negative. Prior
   TTE was negative, but will need to consider repeat if patient remains
   febrile or additional culture return positive.
   - PLAN: VANC/[**Last Name (un) **] through 10/18per  ID recs.
   .
   #)  Agitation / EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation
   taper and transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine
   supplementation. Social work consult once more awake and on PMV.
   -          requires sedation with valium, methadone. Taper methadone
   down to q12h, discont standing haldol, and wean off these meds.
   -          Consider psych consult as patient becomes more awake
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week, improving to 24.. No evidence of
   bleeding currently, and she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic
   component of her pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is
   likely playing at least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage
   on repeat imaging study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs
   all checked, iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   #) Eosinophilia: Will continue to trend qOD, ?medication related.
   #) GERD: PO PPI
   #) FEN: Tube
   feeds
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.
   #) Communication: Family (mother and father), mom [**Name (NI) 251**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2180**]. Family visited yesterday, provided letter documenting that pt

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, fevers, bacteremia, agitation, and other medical conditions. The patient underwent tracheostomy, had her PICC line removed, and is being weaned off sedation. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which has been confirmed by imaging and positive sputum culture for Klebsiella. The patient's fevers have subsided, and her white blood cell count is trending down. She is currently on a fentanyl patch and receiving tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She is being weaned off the ventilator and tracheostomy mask, indicating improvement. However, she may still face complications related to respiratory failure, such as pneumonia or further deterioration in lung function.

2. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient initially presented with fevers and bacteremia. Although her fevers have improved, she still has low-grade temperatures. She has received appropriate antibiotic therapy for VAP, but further evaluation and treatment may be necessary based on culture results.

3. Agitation and Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is experiencing periods of agitation. She requires sedation with valium and methadone. T"

   The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The right PICC line tip can be
   followed
   till the level of mid SVC - pulled back?. There is interval increase in
   bilateral perihilar predominantly interstitial opacities suggesting
   developed
   interstitial pulmonary edema, mild to moderate. Bilateral pleural
   effusions
   are present, unchanged accompanied by bibasal atelectasis, left more
   than
   right.
   Microbiology: [**2162-11-14**] blood cx pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure:
    - Weaned to facemask
   - Discontinued fent/versed gtts, on fent patch at 150mcg/hour >
   Continuing to wean sedation from prior team
s plan:
   Haldol appeared to work well with improvement during the day in regards
   to her agitation. Given that the patient tends to become more agitated
   and restless overnight, increased PM haldol dose to 10 mg, and give Q6H
   dosing of 5 mg during the day. Continuing valium 10 mg PO TID, and will
   plan to go up further if needed to wean versed once she is on a stable
   haldol dose (today making additional adjustments). Continuing fentanyl
   patch. Follow ECGs
   - Continue to work on diuresis goal about 500cc-1000cc.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - Speech consult for assistance with PMV once she tolerates trach mask,
   which may help patient speak and become more oriented, less agitated.
   .
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   Continues to have intermittent low grade temperatures (100), but as
   noted yesterday, fever curve appears to be improving.
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**]. Work up has included a TTE which
   was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines have been changed and
   PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound revealed there was not
   enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and again this was
   consistent with CT completed last week. Bandemia appeared to have
   improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed 14 day course of
   zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures which were
   coagulase negative staph until sensitivities return. Given that she has
   had two positive cultures, cannot solely attribute this to
   contamination, however surveillance cultures have been negative. Prior
   TTE was negative, but will need to consider repeat if patient remains
   febrile or additional culture return positive.
   - PLAN: Meropenem for 8 day total course (Klebs), vanco remains
   .
   #) EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation taper and
   transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine supplementation. Social
   work consult once more awake and on PMV.
   .
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   .
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week, improving to 24.. No evidence of
   bleeding currently, and she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic
   component of her pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is
   likely playing at least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage
   on repeat imaging study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs
   all checked, iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   .
   #) Eosinophilia: Will continue to trend qOD, ?medication related.
   .
   #) GERD: PO PPI
   .
   #) FEN: Tube
   feeds

   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy. The patient continues to experience agitation and has been on sedation. Her recent progress includes tolerating a facemask, weaning off fentanyl and versed, and starting haloperidol for agitation. The patient's labs show improvement in WBC count, Hct, and platelets. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions, bibasal atelectasis, and interstitial pulmonary edema. She has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is now on a 7-day course of meropenem. The patient's gallbladder is distended and thickened but without acute issues. She has anemia, stable Hct, likely due to phlebotomy and anemia of chronic disease. Her INR is elevated but stable, possibly due to nutritional deficiencies. The patient has eosinophilia and is on tube feeds and PPI for GERD. Her code status is full code, and her disposition is still in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's continued periods of agitation and restlessness may pose a risk of self-extubation or increased work of breathing.
2. Fevers and bacteremia: Although the patient's fever curve is improving,"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of anxiety and pancreatitis. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. 

24-hour events:
- The patient stopped taking haloperidol (Haldol) and reduced her methadone dosage.
- Her anxiety improved, but she still required periodic administration of haloperidol as needed.
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.46, which indicates respiratory alkalosis. The patient's fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was adjusted to 50% and plans were made to gradually decrease it.
- The patient experienced nausea and vomiting overnight, possibly due to tube feeds. Ondansetron (Zofran) was administered and the tube was placed on suction.
- In the morning, the patient reported that her left upper quadrant discomfort had resolved. However, she expressed a desire for more anxiety medications.

Allergies:
- The patient has an unknown allergy to codeine.

Last dose of antibiotics:
- Vancomycin was given on November 16th at 8:00 PM.
- Meropenem was administered on November 17th at 2:00 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure:
   Related to anxity/need for sedation and hypoventilation, as well as
   suspected and treated VAP
    - Weaned to trachmaskmask
   - Discontinued fent/versed gtts, on fent patch at 150mcg/hour
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be recering from VAP slowly. Cont to wean off trach mask
   Continuing to wean sedation from prior team
s plan:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment as noted below.
   - 1:1 sitter to help re-orient patient to ensure safety of her lines
   and tracheostomy and hopefully further safely wean sedation since this
   has been a major barrier.
   - PMV trial yesterday went well.
                                                                      over
   #) Fevers, bacteremia:
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], now only low-grade temps.. Work up
   has included a TTE which was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines
   have been changed and PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound
   revealed there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and
   again this was consistent with CT completed last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - continues with low-grade temps.
   - WBC trending back down from 13.9.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures which were
   coagulase negative staph until sensitivities return. Given that she has
   had two positive cultures, cannot solely attribute this to
   contamination, however surveillance cultures have been negative. Prior
   TTE was negative, but will need to consider repeat if patient remains
   febrile or additional culture return positive.
   - PLAN: VANC/[**Last Name (un) **] through 10/18per  ID recs.
   .
   #)  Agitation / EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation
   taper and transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine
   supplementation. Social work consult once more awake and on PMV.
   -          requires sedation with valium, methadone. Taper methadone
   down to q12h, discont standing haldol, and wean off these meds.
   -          Consider psych consult as patient becomes more awake
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week, improving to 24.. No evidence of
   bleeding currently, and she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic
   component of her pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is
   likely playing at least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage
   on repeat imaging study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs
   all checked, iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   #) Eosinophilia: Will continue to trend qOD, ?medication related.
   #) GERD: PO PPI
   #) FEN: Tube
   feeds
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, fevers, and bacteremia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, percutaneous drain placement, and removal of suture material. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to anxiety and hypoventilation, as well as suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been weaned to a tracheostomy mask and continues to receive sedation. Further weaning of sedation and potential extubation may be considered.
2. Fevers and Bacteremia: The patient has had persistent low-grade temperatures, indicating ongoing infection. Her blood cultures have shown gram-positive bacteria, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, which have been treated with vancomycin. Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified in her sputum, and she is receiving meropenem for VAP.
3. Agitation and EtOH Abuse: The patient requires sedation with valium and methadone. Methadone is being tapered down to q12h, and Haldol is being discontinued. Folate and thiamine supplementation have been initiated. A psych consult may be necessary as the patient becomes more awake.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure/VAP:
   Related to anxity/need for sedation and hypoventilation, as well as
   suspected and treated VAP
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for VAP/Klebs
    - Weaned to trachmask, still somewhat hypoxic requiring 50%TM
   - Discontinued fent/versed gtts, on fent patch at 150mcg/hour
   - PMV trial yesterday went well. She is using it well.
                                                                       [**Last Name (un) **]
   #) Coag neg and bacillus bacteremia:
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], now only low-grade temps.. Work up
   has included a TTE which was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines
   have been changed and PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound
   revealed there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and
   again this was consistent with CT completed last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection, all tests negative
   - continues with low-grade temps.
   - WBC trending back down from 13.9
 10.4
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures which were
   coagulase negative staph until sensitivities return. Given that she has
   had two positive cultures, cannot solely attribute this to
   contamination, however surveillance cultures have been negative. Prior
   TTE was negative, but will need to consider repeat if patient remains
   febrile or additional culture return positive.
   - PLAN: VANC/[**Last Name (un) **] through 10/18per  ID recs.
   .
   #)  Agitation / EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation
   taper and transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine
   supplementation. Social work consult once more awake and on PMV.
   -          requires sedation with valium, methadone. Tapered methadone
   down to q12h, discont standing haldol, and wean off these meds.
   -          Consider psych consult as patient becomes more awake
   #) ABD PAIN/Pancreatitis: Ongoing inflammation seen on recent CT. Could
   be residual pancreatitis, though pseudocyst a possibility. Start with
   KUB and can remimage. Abd not impressively tender to palpation at this
   time.
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   -
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week, improving to 24.. No evidence of
   bleeding currently, and she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic
   component of her pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is
   likely playing at least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage
   on repeat imaging study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs
   all checked, iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   #) Eosinophilia: Will continue to trend qOD, ?medication related.
   #) GERD: PO PPI
   #) FEN: Tube
   feeds
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted for pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests. The patient required intubation due to increased work of breathing and had a tracheostomy performed. She continues to experience periods of agitation and requires sedation.

The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and coagulase-negative and bacillus bacteremia. Imaging shows no evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia. Blood cultures are pending. The patient has completed a 14-day course of antibiotics for the bacteremia. She has also been treated for a possible Clostridium difficile infection, which was negative.

The patient's anxiety is better controlled, but she still requires periodic use of haloperidol as needed. Her anxiety medications have been tapered, and she has been transitioned off some sedatives.

The patient's abdominal pain is attributed to ongoing inflammation seen on recent CT scans, which may be residual pancreatitis or a pseudocyst. An ultrasound revealed no fluid for paracentesis.

The patient's gallbladder is distended and thickened but does not currently have any acute issues. Cholecystectomy has been scheduled for 5 weeks after she recovers from her acute illness.

The patient's anemia is stable, and her HCT is improving. Iron"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory Status: Stable Currently on 50% trach mask.   Should be
   reassessed for trach removal.
   #) Coag neg and bacillus bacteremia: MSSE bacteremia [**11-9**]. On
   vancomycin now.  Awaiting sensitivities to determine course of
   vancomycin.  She has completed 14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which
   covered entercoccous in one blood culture.
   #)VAP: Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated
   pneumonia, especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   -Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem for VAP.

   #)  Agitation / EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation
   taper and transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine
   supplementation. Social work consult once more awake and on PMV.
   -requires sedation with valium, methadone. Tapered methadone down to
   q12h, discont standing haldol, and wean off these meds.
   -  Consider psych consult as patient becomes more awake
   #) ABD PAIN/Pancreatitis: Ongoing inflammation seen on recent CT. Could
   be residual pancreatitis, though pseudocyst a possibility. Consider abd
   CT next week.
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute illness.
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week, improving to 24.. No evidence of
   bleeding currently, and she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic
   component of her pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is
   likely playing at least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage
   on repeat imaging study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs
   all checked, iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   #) Eosinophilia: Will continue to trend qOD, ?medication related.
   #) GERD: PO PPI
   #) FEN: Tube feeds
   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40 year old female with history of pancreatitis, alcohol
   abuse, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH for
   pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated LFTs, intubated for
   increased work of breathing, status post tracheostomy, with continued
   periods of agitation.
   #) Respiratory failure/VAP:
   Related to anxity/need for sedation and hypoventilation, as well as
   suspected and treated VAP
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for VAP/Klebs
    - Weaned to trachmask, still somewhat hypoxic requiring 50%TM
   - Discontinued fent/versed gtts, on fent patch at 150mcg/hour
   - PMV trial yesterday went well. She is using it well.
   [**Last Name (un) **]
   #) Coag neg and bacillus bacteremia:
   She has had fevers since [**Date range (1) 2161**], now only low-grade temps.. Work up
   has included a TTE which was negative for abscess or vegetation. Lines
   have been changed and PICC was removed yesterday. Abdominal ultrasound
   revealed there was not enough fluid for a paracentesis last week, and
   again this was consistent with CT completed last week. Bandemia
   appeared to have improved since initiation of flagyl. She has completed
   14 day course of zosyn ([**Date range (1) 2425**]) which covered entercoccous in one
   blood culture.
   Imaging has been consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia,
   especially given klebseilla in sputum.
   - Status post 14 day course of empiric flagyl (last day today) for
   question of c. difficile infection, all tests negative
   - continues with low-grade temps.
   - WBC trending back down from 13.9
 10.4
   - Following all culture data, including surveillance cultures.
   - Given sensitivities and imaging, cipro stopped. Sputum klebsiella is
   very sensitive to meropenem for VAP.
   - Will continue vancomycin for gram positive blood cultures which were
   coagulase negative staph until sensitivities return. Given that she has
   had two positive cultures, cannot solely attribute this to
   contamination, however surveillance cultures have been negative. Prior
   TTE was negative, but will need to consider repeat if patient remains
   febrile or additional culture return positive.
   - PLAN: VANC/[**Last Name (un) **] through 10/18per  ID recs.
   .
   #)  Agitation / EtOH abuse: Last known drink was PM of [**10-24**]. Sedation
   taper and transition as noted above. Folate and thiamine
   supplementation. Social work consult once more awake and on PMV.
   -          requires sedation with valium, methadone. Tapered methadone
   down to q12h, discont standing haldol, and wean off these meds.
   -          Consider psych consult as patient becomes more awake
   #) ABD PAIN/Pancreatitis: Ongoing inflammation seen on recent CT. Could
   be residual pancreatitis, though pseudocyst a possibility. Start with
   KUB and can remimage. Abd not impressively tender to palpation at this
   time.
   #) Distended, thickened, gallbladder:  No acute issues at present. Her
   cholecystitis has been felt to be related to edema from her
   pancreatitis, and no stones have been seen on repeated imaging. At OSH,
   a percutaneous drain was placed out of concern for possible
   cholangitis, revealed only bile. Patient has since pulled out the
   percutaneous tube, and no further intervention has been deemed
   necessary; surgical team has since removed the suture material that
   remained.
   -          Cholecystectomy in [**5-9**] weeks after recovers from acute
   illness.
   -
   #) Anemia: Stable HCT this week, improving to 24.. No evidence of
   bleeding currently, and she has not had any evidence of a hemorrhagic
   component of her pancreatitis noted on CT previously. Phlebotomy is
   likely playing at least a small role as well. No evidence of hemorrhage
   on repeat imaging study. Iron studies, B12, folate, hemolysis, DIC labs
   all checked, iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   B12/folate WNL.
   - HCT stable, continuing to follow trend.
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, patient
s INR had slowly trended upward,
   suspect likely secondary to nutritional deficiencies given that patient
   was NPO, then only on TPN. She has received Vitamin K.
   #) Eosinophilia: Will continue to trend qOD, ?medication related.
   #) GERD: PO PPI
   #) FEN: Tube

   #) PPx: On PPI (hx GERD), pneumoboots
   #) Code: Full, confirmed with patient.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for pancreatitis, gallbladder edema, and elevated liver function tests. The patient is intubated and has had periods of agitation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure/VAP (Ventilator-associated pneumonia): The patient has been intubated and has shown signs of hypoventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics for suspected VAP.

2. Coag-negative and Bacillus bacteremia: The patient has had fevers since [Date range (1) 2161] and has tested positive for coag-negative staphylococcal bacteremia and Bacillus species. The source of infection is still under investigation, and appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated.

3. Agitation/EtOH abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse may contribute to her agitation. Sedation taper and transition have been planned, along with folate and thiamine supplementation.

4. ABD pain/Pancreatitis: The patient continues to experience inflammation in the abdomen, which may be due to residual pancreatitis or the formation of a pseudocyst. Further imaging and evaluation are needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

5. Distended, thickened gallbladder:"
