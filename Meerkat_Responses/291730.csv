   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o M w/ h/o ETOH cirrhosis with multiple previous
   admissions for UGIB [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear's and esophagitis who now
   represents with hematemesis.
   .
   # Upper GI Bleed: Likely [**2-23**] to esophagitis seen on recent EGD, but
   repeat scope may be needed to reevaluate for bleeding vessels etc.  Hct
   from 30 -> 24.  Unlikely variceal bleed given multiple recent scopes
   w/o varices.
   - If does not bump appropriately with blood tx will consult surgery.
   - Goal INR < 1.5
   - Maintain 2 cross matched units at all times
   - PPI ggt
   - Vitamin K 10mg x 1
   - Femoral line
   - 2 large bore IV's at all times
   - For massive bleeding activate Massive Transfusion Protocol for factor
   replacement
   - Likely scope by GI today
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely combination of volume depletion and ETOH
   withdrawal (given hypertension and tachycardia).  Pt over 10L positive
   on admission but persistently tachycardic, unlikely to be solely volume
   depletion as never hypotensive
   - Aggressive volume resuscitation
   - follow fever curve
   - CIWA scale with ativan given liver disease.
   - follow UOP

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and cirrhosis who presented with hematemesis, likely due to an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received blood products and fluids but remains tachycardic and febrile. Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show signs of volume overload. The plan includes performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate the source of bleeding, maintaining a goal INR below 1.5, and monitoring for complications such as infections or hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcoholism and cirrhosis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as altered mental status or confusion.
3. Variceal bleed: Despite the absence of varices on recent endoscopies, there is still a possibility of a variceal bleed, which can be life-threatening.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's hypotension and use of nephrotoxic medications may increase the risk of renal dysfunction.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's condition may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypophosph"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder (ETOH) and cirrhosis. He has been admitted multiple times for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophagitis, [Doctor First Name **] [Doctor Last Name **] tear, gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient presented with hematemesis and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of multiple admissions for UGIB, and the current episode of hematemesis suggests a possible recurrence. The source of bleeding is likely esophagitis, [Doctor First Name **] [Doctor Last Name **] tear, gastritis, or PUD. Further evaluation with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to determine the exact cause and extent of the bleeding.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely a combination of volume depletion due to ongoing bleeding and alcohol withdrawal. The goal is to limit fluids and monitor for signs of hypotension or worsening tachycardia.

3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. However, the absence of signs of infection on the chest X"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o M w/ h/o ETOH cirrhosis with multiple previous
   admissions for UGIB [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear's and esophagitis who now
   represents with hematemesis.
   .
   # Upper GI Bleed: Likely [**2-23**] to esophagitis, [**Doctor First Name 1856**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear,
   gastritis, PUD.  Hct from 30 -> 24 on presentation.  Unlikely variceal
   bleed given multiple recent scopes w/o varices, but will need EGD for
   further evaluation.
   - If does not bump appropriately with blood products will consult
   surgery.
   - Goal INR < 1.5
   - Maintain 2 cross matched units at all times
   - PPI ggt, d/c octreotide given low suspicion for variceal bleed
   - received Vitamin K 10mg x 1
   - Femoral line
   - 2 large bore IV's at all times
   - For massive bleeding activate Massive Transfusion Protocol for factor
   replacement
   - GI to perform EGD this AM ([**3-20**])
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely combination of volume depletion and ETOH
   withdrawal (given hypertension and tachycardia).  Pt over 10L positive
   on admission but persistently tachycardic, unlikely to be solely volume
   depletion as never hypotensive.
   - limit fluids now, likely overloaded (vascular congestion on CXR)
   - follow fever curve
   - CIWA scale with ativan for ETOH withdrawal
   - follow UOP
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely [**2-23**] to GIB, volume contraction, leukemoid
   reaction.  Continue to trend.  CXR without signs of infection.
   - f/u micro data
   .
   # ETOH Cirrhosis: hold nadolol, lactulose for now in setting of bleed.
   - CIWA scale q1H with ativan
   - Cipro for SBP prophylaxis per GI
   - f/u LFT's
   - received vitamin K, FFP
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   .
   # Depression: hold seroquel, restart when able to take PO's.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, blood, NPO  -> Pt will need aggressive electrolyte
   depletion for hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, multiple previous admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and esophagitis. He presented with hematemesis, likely due to esophagitis, [Doctor First Name 1856] tear, gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). His hemoglobin concentration decreased from 30 to 24 on presentation. There is a low suspicion for variceal bleeding, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been scheduled for further evaluation.

The patient is currently in withdrawal and experiencing tachycardia, which may be a combination of volume depletion and ETOH withdrawal. Fluids should be limited due to the possibility of being overloaded, and the patient's fever curve should be followed. The CIWA scale with lorazepam will be used to manage ETOH withdrawal symptoms.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which could be related to GIB, volume contraction, or leukemoid reaction. The chest X-ray does not show signs of infection, so it is important to trend the fever and follow up on micro data.

The patient has ETOH cirrhosis and requires prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs). Thiamine, folate, and multivitamins should also be administered. Seroquel should be held until the patient can take oral medications again.

The patient is experiencing hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia, so aggressive electrolyte depletion is necessary. Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of UGIB and current presentation with hematemesis indicate a high risk for further bleeding. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is crucial. Close attention should be given to the results of the EGD to determine the underlying cause of the bleeding and appropriate management.

2. ETOH withdrawal syndrome: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia and hypertension may be indicative of ETOH withdrawal. Monitoring the CIWA scale with lorazepam and providing supportive care are essential in managing withdrawal symptoms and preventing complications such as seizures.

3. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis raise concerns about possible infection. Monitoring the fever curve, following up on micro data, and conducting appropriate cultures and imaging studies will help identify any infectious etiology and guide treatment.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has ETOH cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring the patient's mental status and using lact"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 y/o M w/ h/o ETOH cirrhosis with multiple previous
   admissions for UGIB [**2-23**] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear's and esophagitis who now
   represents with hematemesis.
   .
   # Upper GI Bleed: Likely [**2-23**] to esophagitis, [**Doctor First Name 1856**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear,
   gastritis, PUD.  Hct from 30 -> 24 on presentation.  Unlikely variceal
   bleed given multiple recent scopes w/o varices, but will need EGD for
   further evaluation.
   - EGD yesterday with esophagitis, gastritis, and duodenitis that was
   the cause of bleeding
   - advancing diet today
   - Goal INR < 1.5
   - Maintain 2 cross matched units at all times
   - PPI ggt, d/c octreotide given low suspicion for variceal bleed
   - received Vitamin K 10mg x 1
   - Femoral line, will removed today after PIVs placed
   - For massive bleeding activate Massive Transfusion Protocol for factor
   replacement
   - appreciate GI recs
   .
   # Withdrawl / Tachycardia: Likely combination of volume depletion and
   ETOH withdrawal (given hypertension and tachycardia).  Pt over 10L
   positive on admission but persistently tachycardic, unlikely to be
   solely volume depletion as never hypotensive.
   - limiting fluids now, likely overloaded (vascular congestion on CXR),
   respiratory status is stable
   - CIWA scale with ativan for ETOH withdrawal
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely [**2-23**] to GIB, volume contraction, leukemoid
   reaction.  Continue to trend.  CXR without signs of infection.
   - f/u micro data
   - no abx at this point, leukocytosis resolved today
   .
   # ETOH Cirrhosis: hold nadolol, lactulose for now in setting of bleed.
   - CIWA scale q1H with ativan
   - Cipro for SBP prophylaxis per GI
 can likely d/c prior to discharge
   - received vitamin K, FFP
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   .
   # Depression: restarting seroquel, now taking POs
   .
   # FEN: advancing diets, needed intense electrolyte repletion overnight
   and into morning, but now is back to baseline
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Endoscopy showed esophagitis and gastritis, but no active bleed. The patient began ethanol withdrawal symptoms yesterday and is currently being treated with benzodiazepines. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been stable. The patient received pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, lorazepam for ethanol withdrawal, and carafate for gastrointestinal protection. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 91 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 150/73 to 91/70 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress or abnormal findings on physical examination. Laboratory results show normal liver enzymes, electrolyte levels within normal range, and slightly low white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt). The patient's blood glucose levels have been relatively stable, with most readings between 112-147 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Although the patient's current endoscopy did not reveal any active bleeding, there is still a risk of rebleeding in patients with UGIB. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary if any signs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). An endoscopy showed esophagitis and gastritis but no active bleed. The patient started withdrawing yesterday and showed symptoms of tremulousness. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been stable. The patient is currently on various medications including pantoprazole, lorazepam, and sucralfate. He also receives infusions of ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a slight decrease in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,953 mL and output of 7,130 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen, and his ABG results are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with clear breath sounds and soft, non-tender abdomen. Extremities are absent on the right side and present on the left side. Neurologic assessment is not complete. Lab results show anemia with a low hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL and slightly elevated white blood cell count. Liver enzymes and electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's blood cultures and WBC count show no significant changes. The patient's condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Although the patient's UGIB has resolved, there"
