   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2207**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.
   The patient remains deeply comatose, but at this time also deeply
   sedated and paralyzed on the Arctic Sun hypothermia protocol.  Other
   than triggering the ventilator, brain stem reflexes appear to be
   absent.  The cause for the cardiac arrest is not entirely clear, as tox
   screen was neg for narcotics. However, by report he had been using
   alcohol and heroin.  The 40 min CPR and post resuscitation neuron
   status does not bode well, and the family is being prepared emotionally
   for this.
   By most other accounts
 labs, vent settings, urine output,
   hemodynamics, etc.
 he is very stable, as we await neurological
   recovery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of heroin abuse admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The patient is currently on an Arctic Sun hypothermia protocol to lower body temperature to 34 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. The cardiac arrest was likely caused by respiratory failure due to heroin and alcohol use rather than a primary cardiac cause. The patient's neurologic response prior to cooling was minimal. 

The plan of care includes continuing the Arctic Sun protocol through 10pm, maintaining invasive ventilation with AC support, obtaining a TTE following Arctic Sun removal, assessing the neuro exam post cooling and weaning of sedation, and obtaining a neurology consult for prognosis of anoxic brain injury. 

Other assessments and plans include monitoring for neurologic recovery in relation to heroin abuse, consulting with social work for substance abuse treatment if there is improvement, considering treatment options for psoriasis, providing nutritional support, managing glycemic control, and implementing prophylaxis measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. 

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that could arise include anoxic brain injury, respiratory failure, complications related to heroin and alcohol abuse, and possible infections due to prolonged invasive procedures."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of heroin abuse admitted after experiencing cardiac arrest. The arrest was likely caused by respiratory failure due to heroin and ethanol use rather than a primary cardiac cause. 

The patient has been placed on the Arctic Sun Protocol for targeted temperature management to cool his body temperature to 34 degrees Celsius (94.1 degrees Fahrenheit) for 24 hours. The goal is to minimize neurological damage. 

The patient is currently sedated and paralyzed, and his vital signs are being closely monitored. He is on invasive ventilation with assist control support and will be weaned based on neurological improvement. 

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be obtained following the completion of the Arctic Sun Protocol. The plan is to assess the patient's neurological exam post-cooling and wean off sedation, with a neurology consult for the prognosis of anoxic brain injury.

The patient also has a history of heroin abuse, hemochromatosis, and psoriasis. He requires ongoing monitoring for neurological recovery, and if improvement is noted, a social work consult and addiction consult will be required. 

In terms of medical interventions, the patient is receiving repletion of electrolytes as needed, a banana bag (likely containing multivitamins and other supplements), and starting on MVI (multivitamins), folate, and thiamine.

The patient has two peripheral intravenous lines, an arterial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced cardiac arrest and has a history of ethanol (ETOH) use and intravenous drug use (IVDU), including heroin. The patient underwent cooling with the Arctic Sun protocol and showed minimal neurologic response prior to cooling. The patient has been sedated and paralyzed due to his propensity to have rigors and fever. There are no identified sources of infection, so vancomycin was stopped and surveillance blood cultures were obtained. The patient requires monitoring for neurologic recovery, especially considering his history of heroin abuse. He will need a social work consult and additional consultations as needed. The patient also has a questionable history of hemochromatosis and severe psoriasis. His electrolytes are being replenished as needed, and he is receiving a banana bag, MVI, folate, and thiamine. The patient has four peripheral IV lines and is currently in the ICU with a full code status and disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant Hyperthermia: The patient's propensity to rigor and become febrile during the Arctic Sun protocol raises concern for malignant hyperthermia. Close temperature monitoring is essential to identify and manage this condition promptly.
2. Anoxic Brain Injury: Due to the cardiac arrest, the patient may have suffered anoxic brain injury. A neurology consult will be obtained once the patient is weaned off paralytics/sedatives, and repeat imaging of the head may be considered in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest. He has a history of heroin abuse and alcohol use. The arrest was likely caused by respiratory failure due to heroin and alcohol intoxication rather than a primary cardiac cause. The patient is currently undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (Arctic Sun protocol) to lower his body temperature to between 32-34 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. He is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode. The patient is also receiving fentanyl, versed, propofol, and cisatracurium infusions. His vital signs include a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 154/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 39.6 degrees Celsius.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to prolonged immobility, mechanical ventilation, and invasive lines, the patient is at risk for developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Neurological impairment: The patient's cardiac arrest may have led to anoxic brain injury, which can result in long-term neurological deficits.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient has elevated levels of lactate acid, indicating possible organ hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of organ function is necessary.
4. Drug addiction relapse: Considering the patient's history of heroin abuse, there is a risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuations in blood pressure and fever. The patient's vital signs indicate sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/88 mmHg to 160/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 103.3 degrees Celsius.

The patient has undergone various interventions, including rewarming with an Arctic sun cold vest, administration of sedatives (propofol, fentanyl, versed), analgesics (meperidine), and muscle relaxants (cisatracurium). The patient also received antibiotics (vancomycin) and was placed on mechanical ventilation with a combination mode ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium), and kidney function tests (BUN/creatinine ratio). Cardiac markers (troponin-T, CK/CKMB) are elevated, indicating potential cardiac injury. Additionally, there are indications of liver dysfunction and altered coagulation profile.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive net fluid input of 3,588 mL since midnight, with a total output of 1,390 mL. The patient's respiratory support settings"

   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- need to formally assess off medications and
   paralytics.  Neuological consultation.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   h/o POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE -- only EtOH identified by tox screen.  Monitor
   for withdrawal.
   RIGORS -- attributed to rewarming.  Need to consider underlying
   infection (new fever).  Check blood, urine, sputum cultures.
   FEVERS -- new.  Possible related to neurological process, complication
   of aspiration or iv drug use.  Consider MNS (although no meds to
   implicate syndrome).  Evalutation in progress.  Check cardiac echo.

   Assessment and Plan
   s/p cardiac arrest in field, heroin overdose.
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST -- resusitated.  s/p therapeutic hypothermia -->
   completed.
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- need to formally assess off medications and
   paralytics.  Neuological consultation.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   h/o POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE -- only EtOH identified by tox screen.  Monitor
   for withdrawal.
   RIGORS -- attributed to rewarming.  Need to consider underlying
   infection (new fever).  Check blood, urine, sputum cultures.
   FEVERS -- new.  Possible related to neurological process, complication
   of aspiration or iv drug use.  Consider MNS (although no meds to
   implicate syndrome).  Evalutation in progress.  Check cardiac echo.
   Currently on Vanco for possible sepsis of skin source.
   TREMORS vs. SEIZURES
 need to better define.  Recommend continuous EEG
   monitoring now to assess for non-convulsive status epilepticus (masked
   by paralytics).

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was resuscitated from a cardiac arrest in the field and underwent therapeutic hypothermia, which has now been completed. The patient developed shivering upon rewarming but is currently controlled with reinstitution of paralytic medication.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received a dose of vancomycin at [**2145-10-5**] 05:00 AM. The patient is currently on propofol and cisatracurium infusions, as well as other ICU medications including meperidine, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the noted episodes of fever, rigors, and seizures. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 93 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 123/70 mmHg to 182/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt is a 30y/o M s/p cardiac arrest with an ETOH level and a h/o
   IVDU including heroine.
   .
   #Neurologic Status
   - Arctic Sun Protocol complete, minimal neurologic response prior to
   cooling.
   - Will assess neuro exam as pt is weaned off paralytics and sedation
   - Due to pt
s propensity to rigor and become febrile, monitor
   temperature closely for concern for malignant hyperthermia.
   - Obtain neurology consult for prognosis of anoxic brain injury once pt
   is able to be weaned off paralytics/sedatives.
   - Consider rpt imaging of head 3-4 days after cardiac arrest, in order
   to evaluate the presence and extent of anoxic brain injury.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest with a history of ethanol (ETOH) intoxication and intravenous drug use (IVDU) including heroin. The patient has been in the ICU and has been sedated and paralyzed due to the Arctic Sun protocol for targeted temperature management following the cardiac arrest.

The patient's medical conditions include neurologic status, cardiopulmonary arrest, febrility, heroin abuse, hemochromatosis, psoriasis, and nutritional deficiency (FEN). The patient has multiple IV lines and is receiving various medications, including sedation medications with an addiction history in mind.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Neurologic recovery: The patient's prognosis for anoxic brain injury will be evaluated once they are weaned off paralytics/sedatives. Monitoring for neurologic recovery is crucial, especially considering the patient's history of heroin abuse.
2. Malignant hyperthermia: Due to the patient's propensity to rigor and become febrile, there is a concern for malignant hyperthermia. Close monitoring of temperature is essential.
3. Infection: Despite stopping Vancomycin, there is still a need to monitor for potential sources of infection and obtain surveillance blood cultures and follow-up urine cultures.
4. Withdrawal symptoms: Considering the patient's history of addiction, there may be a need to treat withdrawal symptoms if appropriate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He has a history of alcohol abuse and intravenous drug use. The patient is currently in the ICU, sedated and paralyzed for medical interventions. He has been treated for fever, but no source of infection has been identified. The patient's neurologic status is being closely monitored, and he is being cooled as part of the Arctic Sun protocol. An EEG has been ordered, and imaging of the head may be considered in the future. The patient's cardiac function is normal, but he is receiving invasive ventilation and will be weaned off paralytics/sedatives based on neurologic improvement. There are concerns about the possibility of malignant hyperthermia and anoxic brain injury. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he requires repletion of electrolytes and vitamins. He has a history of hemochromatosis and psoriasis, but no current interventions are planned for these conditions. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant Hyperthermia: The patient's propensity to rigor and become febrile raises concerns about the possibility of malignant hyperthermia. Monitoring temperature closely is essential to address this concern.
2. Anoxic Brain Injury: Given the patient's cardiac arrest, there is a risk of anoxic brain injury. Neurologic examination and imaging studies may be necessary to evaluate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and has a history of alcohol abuse and intravenous drug use. The patient's current condition includes ongoing sedation and paralysis, fever, hypertension, tachycardia, and abnormal neurological findings.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Malignant Hyperthermia: Due to the patient's propensity to rigor and become febrile, there is a concern for malignant hyperthermia. Monitoring temperature closely is important for early detection.

2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's prognosis of anoxic brain injury should be evaluated once he is weaned off paralytics/sedatives. Imaging of the head may be considered to assess the presence and extent of brain injury.

3. Infection: Despite no identified sources of infection, the patient has persistent febrility. Surveillance blood cultures and follow-up urine cultures should be obtained to rule out any potential infections.

4. Neurological Recovery: Given the patient's history of heroin abuse, monitoring for neurological recovery is crucial. If improvement is observed, a social work consult and addiction consultation may be necessary.

5. Withdrawal Symptoms: Considering the patient's addiction history, dosing sedation medications should take into account the potential need to treat withdrawal symptoms.

6. Hemochromatosis: Although the patient has a questionable history of hemochromatosis, no current interventions are mentioned. Further evaluation and management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who presented with a cardiac arrest and has a history of alcohol abuse and intravenous drug use. He was found to be seizing and was administered antiepileptic medications, including Dilantin and Keppra. The patient still exhibited myoclonus movements, which were attributed to the seizures. Neurology recommended against further treatment for the seizures.

The patient's urine toxicology was positive for opiates and benzodiazepines. He was loaded with Dilantin and Keppra, and a trans thoracic echo showed normal global and biventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction >75%. The patient developed a fever of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit and was placed on a cooling blanket to prevent malignant hyperthermia. His blood pressure was elevated in the 160s, and he had tachycardia in the 100s-110s.

The patient received multiple infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, ranitidine, and heparin sodium. He also received other medications such as Dilantin and Keppra. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies, and his last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygenation were closely monitored. His physical examination showed well-nourished appearance with no corneal reflexes, fixed pupils, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with no known drug allergies. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a peak temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit on [2145-10-5] at 05:00 PM. The patient's blood pressure has been consistently high, ranging from 158/83 mmHg to 168/99 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has been elevated, ranging from 100s to 110s beats per minute. Respiratory rate has been within normal range, between 14 and 21 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation has been maintained at around 96%. 

The patient's ejection fraction (EF) was greater than 75% according to a transthoracic echo performed at 08:35 AM on [2145-10-5]. The patient tested positive for opiates and benzos in urine toxicology. The patient was loaded with Dilantin and Keppra. Dilantin level was reported to be between 10-11, so the patient continued on 100 IV q8. The patient experienced focal seizures before Keppra loading but showed no evidence of seizures on EEG after Keppra administration. Neurology evaluated the patient overnight and reported myoclonus, not seizures, so they did not treat it. 

The patient has been receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, ran"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been admitted with respiratory failure following a cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient also has a left lower lobe infiltrate, indicating possible pneumonia. The patient's coma is likely attributed to anoxic brain injury and is receiving sedation. Neurology is following up and plans for repeat imaging in the next 24-48 hours with the aim of reducing sedation as tolerated.

Additionally, the patient experienced status epilepticus, which has now improved with controlled toe/foot focal seizure. The plan is to optimize anticonvulsants and continue EEG monitoring with the assistance of the epilepsy service.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit (fever), blood pressure ranging from 158/76 mmHg to 112/54 mmHg, heart rate between 107 and 114 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 14 and 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a respiratory support system.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels show slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in liver function tests, including elevated troponin-T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, and amylase.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. They have a history of seizures, which were controlled overnight with Dilantin and Cepra, and continue to receive IV Versed. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.0 F, heart rate between 95-114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/54-168/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient has been receiving Fentanyl and Midazolam infusions. They have been diagnosed with a coma following cardiopulmonary arrest, respiratory failure with evidence of left lower lobe infiltrate, and seizures in status epilepticus. Neurology is following the case, and repeat imaging is planned within the next 24-48 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia caused by bacteria that colonize the respiratory tract.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins, which may then travel to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening embolism.
3. Stress ulcer: Intensive care unit stays and severe illnesses can lead to stress ulcers, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and is suspected to have overdosed. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been sedated and paralyzed to prevent any movement or self-inflicted injuries. He is currently being treated with levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizures and dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a maximum of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit. He has been on a cooling blanket to prevent malignant hyperthermia. An MRI with diffusion waited images was performed to evaluate for anoxic brain injury. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly low, and his hemoglobin level is within the normal range. His platelet count is also within normal limits. Renal function tests show no abnormalities. Electrolyte levels are within normal ranges. The patient has a history of heroin abuse and hemochromatosis, but no current interventions have been done for these conditions. He also has severe psoriasis, but no treatment is currently indicated. The patient's family will be consulted for his medication list. He is receiving banana bag nutrition, multivitamins, folate, and thiamine supplementation. The patient has multiple peripheral IV lines, an arterial line, and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation, and stress ulcer medication. His code status is full code, and he will be staying in the"

The patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and possible overdose. He has been intubated and sedated, and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with hemochromatosis, psoriasis, and heroin abuse. He also has an infection in his lower left lung lobe (PN) and gram-negative rods (GNR) in his sputum. The patient's neurological status is being closely monitored due to his unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli, dilated pupils, and recent head CT showing edema but no herniation. An intracranial monitoring bolt was placed, and an MRI with diffusion-weighted images is pending to evaluate for anoxic brain injury. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a high of 102.2°F, and he is being treated with a cooling blanket to prevent malignant hyperthermia. He is also at risk for increasing intracranial pressures (ICP), and neurosurgery will be consulted if ICP exceeds 30. The patient is receiving multiple medications including levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizures, lorazepam (Versed) for sedation, ranitidine (Prophylaxis) for stress ulcers, heparin sodium (Prophylaxis) for deep vein thrombosis, ceftriaxone and Flagyl for pneumonia, and dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and elevated blood pressure. They have been started on levo/flagyl and placed on Levetiracetam (Keppra). The patient's fever has been managed with a cooling blanket, and blood cultures were sent. The patient has allergies to no known drugs. They received antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole) at different times. The patient is on several medications including midazolam (versed), ranitidine (prophylaxis), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Vital signs show a high temperature, increased heart rate, slightly elevated blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable condition. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,327 mL and output of 1,481 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but troponin-T levels are slightly elevated. Other lab values are within normal limits.

   #Neurologic Status
   - Arctic Sun Protocol complete, minimal neurologic response prior to
   cooling.
   - Will assess neuro exam as pt is weaned off paralytics and sedation,
   72 hours after presentation.
   - Due to pt
s propensity to rigor and become febrile, monitor closely
   and apply cooling blanket to prevent malignant hyperthermia.
   - MRI with diffusion waited images, in order to evaluate the presence
   and extent of anoxic brain injury.
   - Follow up EEG report
   - Continue Keppra and Dilantin (following Dilantin levels.)
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic improvement.
   - Follow up EEG report.
   # Febrility:
   - No identified sources of infection.
   - F/u cultures.
   # Heroin Abuse - will need to monitor for neurologic recovery, if
   improvement pt will require SW consult and addition consult
   - Dosing sedation medications with addiction history in mind, with
   potential need treat withdrawal symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest with a history of alcohol abuse and intravenous drug use, including heroin. He was started on Levo/Flagyl and loaded with Levetiracetam (Keppra). The patient briefly became hypertensive with systolic blood pressures reaching 190, but the blood pressure resolved without the need for Labetolol. The patient has been febrile since the previous night, with a fever of 102.2. He was placed on a cooling blanket and blood cultures were sent. The patient has a history of hemochromatosis, psoriasis, and FEN (likely referring to familial endometriosis or another condition). He is receiving IV fluids and nutrition, including a banana bag, and will start multivitamins, folate, and thiamine. The patient has multiple IV lines in place for ongoing care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurologic complications: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and cardiac arrest, there is a high risk of neurologic damage. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, with plans to assess his neurologic status as he is weaned off paralytics and sedation. An MRI with diffusion-weighted images is planned to evaluate for anoxic brain injury. 
2. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and lack of identified sources of infection suggest the possibility of a hospital-acquired infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with evidence of new progressive left lower lobe pneumonia. Neurological exams have revealed a right pupil that is larger and fixed, indicating possible global ischemia and increased brain edema. The patient also exhibits rhythmic movements of the right foot, which could be related to seizures. Renal function appears to be preserved, and fluid balance is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which necessitates mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to the new progressive pneumonia.

2. Seizures: The patient has shown occasional breakthrough seizures involving the right foot. This indicates a potential risk for seizure activity, and appropriate measures are being taken to control and monitor this.

3. Global Ischemia and Increased Brain Edema: The fixed and dilated right pupil suggests global ischemia, which is a serious concern. Increased brain edema can lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP), requiring close monitoring and management.

4. Pneumonia: The presence of new progressive left lower lobe pneumonia increases the risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and potential complications such as sepsis or respiratory distress.

5. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient likely suffered an anoxic brain injury during the cardiac arrest, resulting in significant"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory failure. They have undergone various medical interventions and remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's neurological examination revealed right pupil dilation and a change from the previous exam. A stat head CT scan showed marked diffuse cerebral edema, loss of grey-white matter discrimination, and effacement of sulci and ventricles. The patient continues to exhibit rhythmic movements of the right foot and remains on a cooling blanket for persistent fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:

1. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The presence of marked diffuse cerebral edema and effacement of sulci and ventricles on the head CT scan suggests an increased ICP. This condition can lead to further deterioration in the patient's neurological status.

2. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures indicates a potential for recurrent seizures due to the ongoing brain dysfunction.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and continued need for mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the patient does not respond to current management strategies.

4. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.

5. Infection: The presence of fever and leukocytosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and is intubated for airway protection. They have a history of global ischemia and increased brain edema, indicating potential damage to the brain. The patient also has evidence of new progressive left lower lobe pneumonia and continues to exhibit rhythmic movements of the right foot. They have been receiving therapeutic hypothermia following an arrest, which likely resulted in anoxic brain injury. Renal function is preserved, and fluid balance is maintained. The patient's condition is described as poor with a likely meaningful recovery. Seizures have improved but still occur occasionally. Neurosurgery and neurology are to be followed up.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications with mechanical ventilation or if the pneumonia progresses.
2. Brain Injury: The patient's global ischemia and increased brain edema indicate potential brain injury. This could lead to further neurological complications such as persistent coma or long-term cognitive impairment.
3. Pneumonia: The new progressive left lower lobe pneumonia may require additional antibiotic treatment or interventions to control the infection and prevent its spread.
4. Seizures: Although seizures have improved, breakthrough seizures still occur. Managing and controlling seizure activity will be crucial to prevent further brain damage.
5. Renal Dysfunction: Although renal function is currently preserved, ongoing monitoring is necessary to detect any changes in kidney function.
6. Fluid Balance: Maintaining"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest in the setting of possible overdose. He has been approximately 72 hours out from the arrest and is currently sedated and intubated. The patient's neurological status needs to be assessed to determine prognosis. Neurological findings include no cold caloric response, no doll's eyes, but some upper extremity reflexes and withdrawal to pain this morning. The patient also has dilated pupils, with the right pupil being more dilated than previously. This is concerning for herniation, although the preliminary head CT only showed edema. Neurosurgery was consulted and an ICP (intracranial pressure) monitor was placed. The patient underwent Arctic Sun protocol for therapeutic hypothermia and showed minimal neurologic response prior and after cooling. Since the patient had a more dilated pupil on examination this morning, a stat head CT was performed to assess for herniation, which was not seen according to the preliminary read. However, the patient did have edema with loss of gray-white matter differentiation. A follow-up final read MRI with diffusion waited images will be evaluated to assess the presence and extent of anoxic brain injury. The patient's propensity to rigidity and become febrile will be closely monitored, and the cooling blanket will be applied to prevent malignant hyperthermia. Continuous monitoring for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial pressures is necessary. If ICP"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced cardiac arrest in a possible overdose setting. He is now approximately 72 hours out from the arrest and is currently in the ICU. 

The patient's neurological status needs to be assessed to determine prognosis. He does not have a cold caloric response or doll's eyes, but he does have some upper extremity reflexes and withdrawal to pain. His pupil was dilated on one exam, which is concerning for herniation, although a preliminary head CT showed only edema without evidence of herniation. Neurosurgery was consulted, and an ICP (intracranial pressure) monitor was placed. 

The patient underwent Arctic Sun Protocol for therapeutic hypothermia, which showed minimal neurological response prior and after cooling. A stat head CT was performed to assess for herniation, which was not seen. However, there was edema with loss of gray-white matter differentiation. 

An MRI with diffusion waited images was ordered to evaluate the presence and extent of anoxic brain injury. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of increasing intracranial pressures, and if ICP exceeds 30, neurosurgery should be called. Hyperventilation with a goal CO2 level of 28-30 and mannitol will continue to manage intracranial pressures. 

There is a question about whether rhythmic foot movements represent seizures. An EEG report is pending to follow up on this. The patient is"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate, and elevated respiratory rate. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various procedures including placement of an ICP catheter, bolt placement for ICP monitoring, and endotracheal intubation.

The patient's medical history is significant for a global infarction as seen on MRI, for which a DNR/DNI status has been established. The patient is on multiple medications including Keppra, mannitol, and repletion of electrolytes as needed.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 164/94 mmHg to 168/96 mmHg, heart rate between 91-113 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14-37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's ICP is within normal range at 13-25 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2288 mL and output of 2255 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 33 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and plateau pressure at 16 cmH2O.

   A/P: Pt is a 30y/o M s/p cardiac arrest in setting of possible
   overdose.
   .
   # Neurologic status/assessment: Will need to assess pt
s neurological
   status as he is no\w approx. 72 hours out from arrest to determine
   prognosis. Per neuro, no cold caloric response, no doll
s eyes although
   later had some UE reflexes and withdrawal to pain this am.  Dilated
   pupil on am exam concerning for herniation although prelim head CT only
   c/w edema. Neurosurg consulted and bolt was placed for intracranial
   monitoring.
   - Arctic Sun Protocol completed, minimal neurologic response prior and
   after cooling.
   - Head CT does note loss of [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
   - F/u final read MRI with diffusion waited images, in order to evaluate
   the presence and extent of anoxic brain injury.
   - Due to pt
s propensity to rigor and become febrile, monitor closely
   and apply cooling blanket to prevent malignant hyperthermia, and treat
   with round the clock APAP.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial
   pressures. Will call neurosurg if ICP>30
   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30 and mannitol
   Seizures: Neurology opinions different regarding whether persistent
   foot movements represent seizures. Will follow up EEG report
   - Continue Keppra and Dilantin (following Dilantin levels). Dilantin
   level therapeutic
   - Increase Keppra dosing since pt still having rhythmic foot movement,
   ? seizure
   -
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - Follow up EEG report.
   - VAP bundle
   # Fever: Likley central vs. from infection. Has new LLL PNA and GNR in
   sputum, speciated to Klebsiella sensitive to ceftriaxone.
   - Ceftriaxone only for treatment of Klebsiella PNA, D/C Flagyl.
   - F/u cultures and sensitivities.
   # Heroin Abuse - will need to monitor for neurologic recovery, if
   improvement pt will require SW consult and addition consult
   - Dosing sedation medications with addiction history in mind, with

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest possibly related to an overdose. He is intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support. The patient has been diagnosed with global infarction and is being monitored for increased intracranial pressure (ICP). He has been placed on an ICP catheter and is receiving mannitol for ICP management. 

The patient has shown signs of fever, with a recorded temperature of 102.3°F. He also has elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained, and the patient is being treated with ceftriaxone for suspected Klebsiella pneumonia.

Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive to noxious stimuli, with dilated pupils and absent corneal reflexes. There are concerns about herniation, but preliminary CT scans only show edema. An Arctic Sun cooling protocol has been completed, but there has been minimal neurological response. An MRI with diffusion waited images is pending to evaluate for anoxic brain injury.

The patient is also being monitored for seizures, with ongoing rhythmic foot movements. An EEG report is awaited to determine if these movements represent seizures. The patient is on antiepileptic drugs Keppra and Dilantin, with a therapeutic level of Dilantin.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and in a coma. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including the insertion of an ICP bolt and ICP catheter, administration of antibiotics, initiation of therapeutic hypothermia, and management of seizures. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation to protect the airway and is being fed through a tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of the bed and performing regular mouth care can help prevent this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures such as compression boots and systemic anticoagulation should be implemented to reduce the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.

3. Nosocomial infections: Due to the invasive nature of the patient's interventions, there is an increased risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. Strict adherence to infection control protocols and appropriate antibiotic usage are crucial in preventing these infections.

4. Complications related to ICP monitoring: The insertion of an ICP bolt and catheter can lead to complications such as hemorrhage or infection. Close monitoring and regular assessment of the ICP parameters are essential to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Coma, anoxic brain injury s/p arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Protecting airway with ETT.
   Evidence for LLL pneumonia --> antibiotics.
   COMA -- attributed to diffuse brain injury.  Poor prognosis.  Hope to
   reduce benzodiazepines to d/c if tolerated by seizures.  Will plan
   apnea test.
   s/p arrest -- s/p therapeutic hypothermia.  No further cardiac
   disturbance.
   SEIZURES -- likely related to anoxic brain injury.  Continue
   anticonvulsants, monitor level.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and in a coma due to anoxic brain injury following an arrest. They have been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's ICP remains elevated, and they are receiving mannitol every 6 hours. Antibiotics have been initiated due to evidence of LLL pneumonia. The patient's condition is poor, but efforts are being made to reduce benzodiazepines and plan an apnea test. Therapeutic hypothermia has been performed, and there have been no further cardiac disturbances. Seizures are likely related to the anoxic brain injury, and anticonvulsants are being monitored. The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding, and fluid balance is euvolemic. ICU care includes prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's status is DNR, and they are currently in the ICU."

s. Bolt in place with ICP goals < 20. MR confirms global anoxic
   brain infarction.
   - family meeting follow-up today to assess goals of care
   - Continue to monitor for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial
   pressures. Will call neurosurg if ICP>30
   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30 and mannitol
   Seizures: Neurology opinions different regarding whether persistent
   foot movements represent seizures. EEG final read suggests that pts
   rhythmic movements are not secondary to seizures. However, since this
   was previously debatable we wil:
   - Continue Keppra and Dilantin (following Dilantin levels). Dilantin
   level therapeutic
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - VAP bundle
   # Fever:  LLL PNA and GNR in sputum, speciated to Klebsiella sensitive
   to ceftriaxone. In addition Sputum culture growing MSSA and

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced cardiac arrest in the setting of a possible overdose. He is now approximately 72 hours out from the cardiac arrest and is being monitored in the ICU for neurologic status. The patient has been sedated and intubated, with a goal ICP (intracranial pressure) of less than 20. An ICP catheter was placed on 10/8/2145 at 12:00 AM. The patient's EEG was negative for seizures, but he continues to have rhythmic foot movements, leading to the continuation of antiepileptic drugs. The patient's fever is being managed, and he has been diagnosed with pneumonia and a positive culture for MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) and enterobacter. Antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly. The patient has a history of heroin abuse and hemochromatosis, but no current interventions are planned for these conditions. He also has severe psoriasis, but no treatment is currently indicated. The patient's sodium levels will be monitored every four hours, and mannitol dosing will be adjusted accordingly. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate), and his disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt is a 30y/o M s/p cardiac arrest in setting of possible
   overdose.
   .
   # Neurologic status/assessment: Will need to assess pt
s neurological
   status as he is no\w approx. 72 hours out from arrest to determine
   prognosis. Per neuro, no cold caloric response, no doll
s eyes although
   later had some UE reflexes and withdrawal to pain this am.  Dilated
   pupil on am exam concerning for herniation although prelim head CT only
   c/w edema. Neurosurg consulted and bolt was placed for intracranial
   monitoring.
   - Arctic Sun Protocol completed, minimal neurologic response prior and
   after cooling.
   - Head CT does note loss of [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
   - F/u final read MRI with diffusion waited images, in order to evaluate
   the presence and extent of anoxic brain injury.
   - Due to pt
s propensity to rigor and become febrile, monitor closely
   and apply cooling blanket to prevent malignant hyperthermia, and treat
   with round the clock APAP.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial
   pressures. Will call neurosurg if ICP>30
   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30 and mannitol
   Seizures: Neurology opinions different regarding whether persistent
   foot movements represent seizures. Will follow up EEG report
   - Continue Keppra and Dilantin (following Dilantin levels). Dilantin
   level therapeutic
   - Increase Keppra dosing since pt still having rhythmic foot movement,
   ? seizure
   -
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - Follow up EEG report.
   - VAP bundle
   # Fever: Likley central vs. from infection. Has new LLL PNA and GNR in
   sputum, speciated to Klebsiella sensitive to ceftriaxone.
   - Ceftriaxone only for treatment of Klebsiella PNA, D/C Flagyl.
   - F/u cultures and sensitivities.
   # Heroin Abuse - will need to monitor for neurologic recovery, if
   improvement pt will require SW consult and addition consult
   - Dosing sedation medications with addiction history in mind, with
   potential need treat withdrawal symptoms.
   .
   # Hemochromatosis - No current interventions. Questionable History
   # Psoriasis - severe psosriasis over elbows, knees and legs. obtain med
   list from family
   - No clinical indications for treatment currently
   .
   # FEN - Repleting lytes prn, receiving banana bag. Will start MVI,
   Folate, Thiamine. Following Na, serum osm q4 hours, dosing mannitol

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, possibly due to a drug overdose. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C) and an increased heart rate. His blood pressure is elevated, and his respiratory rate is in the 30s. The patient has a history of heroin abuse and psoriasis. He is receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, ceftriaxone, and heparin. The patient's neurological status is concerning, with no cold caloric response or doll's eyes, but some reflexes have been observed. A head CT shows edema, and an Arctic Sun protocol was completed with minimal neurologic response. An MRI with diffusion-weighted images is pending to evaluate for anoxic brain injury. The patient is at risk for seizures, with ongoing monitoring and treatment. He also has a lower limb pneumonia and gram-negative rods in his sputum, which are sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient's family has been informed about his prognosis and goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and evidence of lower limb pneumonia. He is already receiving antibiotics, but close monitoring for signs of worsening infection is necessary.
2. Seizures: The patient may be at risk for seizures due to his brain injury and drug abuse history"

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a temperature of 101.5 C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/91 mmHg to 178/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's intracranial pressure (ICP) is elevated at 25 mmHg. The patient has received various medications including fentanyl, versed, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which could progress to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The patient's elevated temperature and elevated white blood cell count may suggest an infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they travel to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest in the setting of a possible overdose. He is now approximately 72 hours post-cardiac arrest and is being closely monitored in the ICU. His neurological status is assessed regularly, and he remains sedated and intubated. The neurology team has confirmed a global anoxic brain infarction. The patient's ICP goals are less than 20, and he is being treated with hyperventilation and mannitol to manage intracranial pressures. There is a family meeting scheduled to discuss goals of care.

Medical Complications:
1. Increasing Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's ICP briefly hit 35 at 3am and has been in the mid-teens. Mannitol has been given multiple times overnight, and the respiratory rate on the ventilator has been increased.
2. Hypoxia: The patient developed hypoxia overnight, and the current ventilator settings are being continued to compensate for this. Weaning will be done as tolerated.
3. Tracheal Trauma/Tracheal Leak: Subcutaneous air has been noted, and a bronchoscopy will be performed to examine the trachea and bronchi for tracheal leak or other etiologies.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia, likely due to VAP. Appropriate antibiotics have been started"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt is a 30y/o M s/p cardiac arrest in setting of possible
   overdose.
   .
   # Neurologic status/assessment: Now approx. > 72 hours out from cardiac
   arrest to determine prognosis. Per neuro, no cold caloric response, no
   doll
s. Bolt in place with ICP goals < 20. MR confirms global anoxic
   brain infarction.
   - Family meeting follow-up today to  assess goals of care
   - Continue to monitor for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial
   pressures. Will call neurosurg if ICP>30
   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30 and mannitol
   Seizures: Neurology opinions different regarding whether persistent
   foot movements represent seizures. EEG final read suggests that pts
   rhythmic movements are not secondary to seizures. However, since this
   was previously debatable we wil:
   - Continue Keppra and Dilantin (following Dilantin levels). Dilantin
   level therapeutic
   #Hypoxia:
   - Cont. current vent setting to compensate for hypoxia that developed
   overnight, and wean as tolerated.
   - Bronchoscopy to examine trachea and bronchi to examine for tracheal
   leak or other etiology for subcutaneous air.
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - VAP bundle
   # Fever:  LLL PNA and GNR in sputum, speciated to Klebsiella sensitive
   to ceftriaxone. In addition Sputum culture growing MSSA and
   enterobacter.
   - Ceftriaxone only for treatment of Klebsiella PNA
   - Adding Clinda for MSSA
   # Heroin Abuse - if improvement pt will require SW consult and addition
   consult
   - Dosing sedation medications with addiction history in mind, with
   potential need treat withdrawal symptoms.
   .
   # Hemochromatosis - No current interventions. Questionable History
   # Psoriasis - severe psosriasis over elbows, knees and legs. obtain med

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been sedated and intubated, with ongoing respiratory support. The main concerns and potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Neurological status: The patient's neurological status remains a concern, with no cold caloric response or doll's eyes reflex. The ICP goals are set below 20, and mannitol is being used to decrease intracranial pressure. There is also a mention of global anoxic brain infarction. Monitoring for increasing ICP and intracranial pressures is essential, and neurosurgery should be called if ICP exceeds 30.

2. Seizures: The patient's rhythmic foot movements have been debated as seizures. Although an EEG suggests these movements are not secondary to seizures, antiepileptic medications (Keppra and Dilantin) are being continued due to previous concerns.

3. Hypoxia: The patient developed hypoxia overnight, and current ventilation settings are being maintained to compensate for this. Weaning of the ventilator will be based on the patient's neurological status.

4. Tracheal leak: The presence of subcutaneous air indicates a possible tracheal leak. A bronchoscopy is planned to examine the trachea and bronchi for any leak or other etiology.

5. Infection: The patient has pneumonia caused by"

   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30 and mannitol
   Seizures: Neurology opinions different regarding whether persistent
   foot movements represent seizures. EEG final read suggests that pts
   rhythmic movements are not secondary to seizures. However, since this
   was previously debatable we wil:

   level therapeutic
   #Hypoxia:
   - Cont. current vent setting to compensate for hypoxia that developed
   overnight, and wean as tolerated.
   - Bronchoscopy to examine trachea and bronchi to examine for tracheal
   leak or other etiology for subcutaneous air.
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - VAP bundle

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, possibly due to an overdose. He has been intubated and sedated. His neurological status remains poor, with no response to noxious stimuli. The patient has developed a fever, and cultures have shown growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He has been treated with antibiotics, including ceftriaxone for Klebsiella pneumoniae and clindamycin for MSSA. The patient also has psoriasis, hemochromatosis, and a history of heroin abuse. His current medications include fentanyl, propofol, versed, heparin sodium, furosemide, pantoprazole, and midazolam. The patient's ICP remains elevated, and he is being closely monitored for signs of increased intracranial pressure. Seizure prophylaxis is ongoing, and the team continues to discuss goals of care with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures such as the VAP bundle should be implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Nosocomial infections: Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, he is at risk of developing nosocomial infections, including"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and various interventions have been performed to manage his condition. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), heart rate ranging from 74-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/63 mmHg to 170/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. His neurologic status is described as poor, with no response to noxious stimuli, fixed and dilated pupils, and absence of corneal reflexes. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal a small mediastinal pneumothorax, collapsed lower left lung lobe atelectasis, and left lower lobe consolidation.

The patient's medical history includes possible overdose, heroin abuse, hemochromatosis, psoriasis, and anoxic brain injury.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. They have been admitted to the ICU for further management and care. The patient's condition has been unstable with ongoing discussions regarding code status and long-term management. Neurology has requested a slow wean off versed and reapplication if upper extremity seizure activity occurs. The patient is currently on 80% FiO2 and has been weaned off versed, with propofol started instead. A CT angiogram of the chest reveals a small mediastinal pneumothorax with subcutaneous air, collapsed lower left lung lobe atelectasis, and left lower lobe consolidation. A bronchoscopy was performed, showing copious purulent secretions in the left lower lingula, but no obvious tracheal/bronchial injury. A BAL was also performed in the left lower lobe. The patient's ICP continued to be elevated, and versed was restarted per neuro and neurosurg recommendations. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were metronidazole on 10/8, ceftriaxone on 10/10, and clindamycin on 10/11. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl and propofol infusions, as well as other ICU medications such as heparin sodium, furosemide, pantoprazole, and midazolam. The patient's"

   Anoxic brain injury s/p cardiopulmonary arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent;  multifactorial; s/p arrest, LLL
   pneumonia, evolving ARDS.  Need to assess apnea test once sedatives
   d/c
   COMA -- s/p arrest.  Evidence for diffuse brain injury by MRI and head
   CT.  Monitor ICP, maintain <20, d/c sedation.  Radiographs demonstrate
   extensive brain injury.  Exam consistent with only minimal brainstem
   function (BP and respiratory center).  Poor prognosis.
   SEIZURE -- currently clinically controled.  Continue dilantin and
   cepra.
   HYPOXEMIA -- multifactorial, atalectasis, pneumonia

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, anoxic brain injury following cardiopulmonary arrest, coma, seizure, and hypoxemia. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with increased FiO2 requirement. Fever is present, and there have been episodes of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which appear to have responded to increased Mannitol. The patient has a history of pneumonia and evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are sedated and unresponsive, with decreased tone. Extensive brain injury is demonstrated on radiographs, and only minimal brainstem function remains.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and pneumonia suggests an increased risk of infection, which could progress to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): Episodes of increased ICP indicate ongoing brain injury and the potential for further rises in ICP, which can lead to herniation and death.
4. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's ARDS may lead to progressive lung injury and impaired gas exchange. Other organ systems, such as the kidneys or liver, could also become compromised.
5. Seizure: Although currently controlled, there is a risk of recurrent seizures due to the extensive brain injury.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's critical condition increases the"

   Anoxic brain injury s/p cardiopulmonary arrest.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent;  multifactorial; s/p arrest, LLL
   pneumonia, evolving ARDS.  Need to assess apnea test once sedatives
   d/c
   COMA -- s/p arrest.  Evidence for diffuse brain injury by MRI and head
   CT.  Monitor ICP, maintain <20, d/c sedation.  Radiographs demonstrate
   extensive brain injury.  Exam consistent with only minimal brainstem
   function (BP and respiratory center).  Poor prognosis.
   SEIZURE -- currently clinically controled.  Continue dilantin and
   cepra.

   Clarification of code status.  Due to clinical and neurological
   evidence for extensive neurological injury, in the event of cardiac
   arrest, CPR would be considered medically futile and thus not medically
   indicated.  Will continue current level of care, but in event of
   cardiac arrest or cardiac dysrhythmia will not perform CPR,
   cardioversion or defibrillation.  Discussed with family who understand
   and agree.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's medical history is significant for anoxic brain injury following cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature and includes factors such as post-arrest complications, left lower lobe pneumonia, and evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is also in a coma, likely due to diffuse brain injury as indicated by MRI and head CT scans. Monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is recommended, with goals to maintain ICP below 20 mmHg and discontinuation of sedation.

Additionally, the patient has experienced a seizure, which is currently being controlled. The patient will continue to receive dilantin and cefepime (cepra) for seizure management.

Hypoxemia is also present and is attributed to various factors including atelectasis and pneumonia.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition support, glycemic control, and the placement of arterial and ICP monitoring lines. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with systemic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention through elevation of head of bed (HOB) and mouth care.

The patient's code status is documented as do not resuscitate (DNR), and their disposition remains in the ICU."

   - Continue to monitor for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial
   pressures. Will call neurosurg if ICP>30
   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30
   Seizures: resolved
   - Continue Keppra
   #Hypoxia:
   - Cont. current vent setting to compensate for hypoxia that developed
   overnight, and wean as tolerated.
   - Bronchoscopy demonstrated copious purulent sputum, and no obvious
   tracheal or bronchial injury.
   - CTA demonstrated small anterior right sided pneumothorax
 will
   continue to follow.
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - VAP bundle
   # Fever:  LLL PNA and GNR in sputum, speciated to Klebsiella sensitive
   to ceftriaxone. In addition Sputum culture growing MSSA and
   enterobacter.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who is currently in the ICU following a cardiac arrest that may have been related to an overdose. The patient has been sedated and intubated, and has undergone various interventions to manage his condition.

The patient's neurological status is a major concern. He is showing signs of global anoxic brain infarction with fixed and dilated pupils, no corneal reflexes, and no cold caloric response. The CT scan confirms anoxic injury and indicates a poor prognosis. The neurologist is monitoring the patient closely for any signs of increasing intracranial pressure (ICP).

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for:
1. Seizures: The patient has had seizures in the past, and seizure prophylaxis is being continued with Kendra (levetiracetam).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on invasive ventilation, and there is a concern for developing VAP. The healthcare team is implementing a VAP bundle to reduce the risk.
3. Pneumothorax: A small anterior right-sided pneumothorax was identified on a CT angiography (CTA), and it is being monitored.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient has developed a lower lobe pneumonia with growth of Klebsiella and MSSA in the sputum culture. Antibiotics have been started to"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt is a 30y/o M s/p cardiac arrest in setting of possible
   overdose.
   .
   # Neurologic status/assessment: Now approx. > 72 hours out from cardiac
   arrest to determine prognosis. Per neuro, no cold caloric response, no
   doll
s. Per MICU daily exams, pt has no corneal reflexes and now has
   pupils that are utterly fixed and dilated.
   - MR confirms global anoxic brain infarction, and rpt CT scan also
   consistent with anoxic injury and poor prognosis.
   - Family meeting follow-up today
   - Continue to monitor for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial
   pressures. Will call neurosurg if ICP>30
   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30
   - Goal today is to wean all sedation as tolerated, and attempt apnea
   test now that pt. is no longer breathing over the vent, but is rather
   breathing in sync with it.
   Seizures: resolved
   - Continue Keppra and Dilantin (following Dilantin levels). Dilantin
   level therapeutic
   #Hypoxia:
   - Cont. current vent setting to compensate for hypoxia that developed
   overnight, and wean as tolerated.
   - Bronchoscopy demonstrated copious purulent sputum, and no obvious
   tracheal or bronchial injury.
   - CTA demonstrated small anterior right sided pneumothorax
 follow up
   CXR to evaluate status of PTX.
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - VAP bundle
   # Fever:  LLL PNA and GNR in sputum, speciated to Klebsiella sensitive
   to ceftriaxone. In addition Sputum culture growing MSSA and
   enterobacter.
   - Ceftriaxone and Clinda for treatment of Klebsiella PNA and possible
   MSSA.
   # Heroin Abuse: dosing sedation medications with addiction history in
   mind, with potential need treat withdrawal symptoms.
   .
   # Hemochromatosis - No current interventions. Questionable History
   # Psoriasis - severe psoriasis over elbows, knees and legs. obtain med
   list from family
   - No clinical indications for treatment currently
   .
   # FEN - Repleting lytes prn, MVI, Folate, Thiamine. Following Na, serum
   osm q4 hours, dosing mannitol accordingly
   .
   # Access:  P-IVs X 4, and intracranial bolt to measure ICP.
   .
   # PPX: bowel regimen, hep SC, H2 blocker
   .
   # Code
 Though the father is concerned with the decision to make him
   DNR/DNI, it has been communicated to the family that the medical team
   would not resuscitate him as cardiopulmonary resuscitation at this
   point would cause more harm than benefit.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with global anoxic brain infarction and poor prognosis. The patient's neurological status is being closely monitored, and there are concerns about increasing intracranial pressures. Sedation is being weaned as tolerated, and an apnea test will be attempted. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with AC support, and the ventilator settings are being adjusted to compensate for hypoxia. Bronchoscopy and CTA have been performed, revealing copious purulent sputum and a small anterior right-sided pneumothorax, respectively. The patient is being treated for pneumonia caused by Klebsiella and possible MSSA, with ceftriaxone and clindamycin. There are also concerns about heroin abuse, hemochromatosis, psoriasis, and folate deficiency. The patient has intracranial bolt and P-IVs in place for monitoring and treatment. The patient's code status is full code, but the medical team would not resuscitate him due to the potential harm caused by CPR."

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and a coma. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated with high FiO2. The patient has been on a continuous mannitol drip and propofol infusion. He also has multiple lines including an arterial line and ICP catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 148/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His review of systems is unremarkable except for the ongoing need for mechanical ventilation. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, pupils dilated, and surgical left pupil. Neurologic examination shows unresponsive consciousness, no spontaneous movement, decreased tone, and flaccid extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been on various antibiotics, sedatives, and paralytics. The assessment and plan include coma due to extensive CNS injury, persistent respiratory failure with multifactorial causes including pneumonia and central hyperventilation, right pneumothorax from barotrauma, ongoing seizure management with anticonvulsants, poor prognosis after suffering an arrest, nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition, pneumonia in the left lower lobe from aspiration, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual who remains in coma and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. They have a history of arrest and evidence of extensive CNS injury. The patient also has pneumonia in the left lower lobe, which is likely due to aspiration. There is a pneumothorax on the right side, possibly caused by barotrauma. Seizures are being managed with anticonvulsants.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, and decreased heart rate. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient's ICP (intracranial pressure) is at 18 mmHg, which is within the normal range.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,481 mL and output of 4,005 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 524 mL. The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeds.

Laboratory results indicate normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelets. Kidney function is slightly impaired with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Liver enzymes and electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's neurological examination reveals unresponsiveness, dilated pupils, and decreased tone. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with present bowel sounds. Extremities are warm and well-perfused.

   # Neurologic status/assessment: Now approx. > 72 hours out from cardiac
   arrest to determine prognosis. Per neuro, no cold caloric response, no
   doll
s. Per MICU daily exams, pt has no corneal reflexes and now has
   pupils that are utterly fixed and dilated.
   - MR confirms global anoxic brain infarction, and rpt CT scan also
   consistent with anoxic injury and poor prognosis.
   - Continued discussions with Family.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial
   pressures. Will call neurosurg if ICP>30
   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30
   Seizures: resolved
   - Continue Keppra
   #Hypoxia:
   - Cont. current vent setting to compensate for hypoxia that developed
   overnight, and wean as tolerated.
   - Bronchoscopy demonstrated copious purulent sputum, and no obvious
   tracheal or bronchial injury.
   - CTA demonstrated small anterior right sided pneumothorax
 will
   continue to follow.
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - VAP bundle
   # Fever:  LLL PNA and GNR in sputum, speciated to Klebsiella sensitive
   to ceftriaxone. In addition Sputum culture growing MSSA and
   enterobacter.
   - Ceftriaxone and Clinda for treatment of Klebsiella PNA and possible
   MSSA started on [**10-5**].
   # Heroin Abuse: dosing sedation medications with addiction history in

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 30-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest in the setting of a possible overdose. He is currently intubated and sedated, with fixed and dilated pupils, no corneal reflexes, and no response to noxious stimuli. The neurologic assessment indicates a global anoxic brain infarction, and the prognosis is poor.

The patient is being monitored for signs of increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) and intracranial pressures are in the low 50s. He is already on high-dose sedation and maximum dose mannitol around the clock. Hyperventilation is being continued with a goal CO2 of 28-30 to prevent possible reactive cerebral vasodilation if ventilation is stopped.

The patient has a history of heroin abuse and is being dosed with sedation medications with addiction history in mind, with potential need to treat withdrawal symptoms. He also has severe psoriasis but no clinical indications for treatment currently.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
- Heart rate: 76 bpm (72-93 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 146/81 mmHg (119-151/66-82 mmHg)

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and coma. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are no new neurological findings reported.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate is 69 bpm with a range of 69-93 bpm, blood pressure is 137/79 mmHg with a range of 119-151/66-82 mmHg, respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute with a set rate of 30 and spontaneous rate of 0, and oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient's review of systems is negative for any symptoms in all categories except for neurologic, where the patient is unresponsive. There are no signs or concerns for abuse, and the patient appears comfortable without any pain.

The physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, no cervical adenopathy, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin without cyanosis or clubbing, and decreased muscle tone.

The laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolyte levels. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 80, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has a history of pneumonia and is on a complete course of antimicrobials. The patient also has anoxic brain injury and remains in a coma. There is no evidence of seizure activity. The patient's fluid balance is being monitored, and the serum osmolality is being monitored as well.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial line, ICP catheter, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury, nosocomial infections, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and delirium."

   Addendum:
   Extensive comprehensive discussion with immediate family (including
   father, mother and sister).  Updated medical condition and answered all
   questions.  In discussing direction of medical care, the unanimous
   opinion was that the patient would not want to continue medical care if
   there was no likelihood for meaningful neurological recovery,
   especially if high likelihood of persistent vegetative state.  Patient
   has expressed this clearly to family members in the past, especially to
   sister.  [**Name (NI) **] in agreement that current level of care should change and
   now be focused on comfort.  Will assure patient comfort, and plan to
   d/c all other interventions (including ETT) once family members have
   opportunity to visit with patient.  Plan to begin in AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and in a coma. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are no new neurological findings. 

The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury with extensive brain injury evident on head CT and MRI, minimal brainstem function, and no clinical evidence of seizures. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/66 mmHg to 151/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,981 mL and output of 2,960 mL, with urine output of 2,810 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 0.6 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels ranging from 94 to 102 mg/dL. 

The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, PaO2 of 64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory support, continuation of antimicrobials for pneumonia, management of coma with mannitol infusion, monitoring serum osmolality, and providing ICU care. 

The patient's family has expressed that they do not want to continue medical care if there is no meaningful neurological recovery and a high likelihood of persistent vegetative state. Therefore, the plan is to focus on comfort care, discontinue all interventions including the endotracheal tube, and begin in the morning."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and coma. They are still intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are no new neurological findings reported. The patient's medical history is unobtainable as they are unable to provide any information due to being in a coma. There are no known drug allergies.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, but their condition remains unchanged. They have been sedated and paralyzed to manage their brain injury, which is extensive based on head CT and MRI results. Mannitol infusion is being continued to manage intracranial pressure.

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, blood pressure within normal limits, and a respiratory rate on the higher end of the normal range. Oxygen saturation is at 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and cardiac rhythm are all within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of abuse. The patient has an endotracheal tube in place for respiratory support. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm, and respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with adequate air entry bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 94 and 124 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 30y/o M s/p cardiac arrest in setting of possible overdose.
   .
   # Neurologic status/assessment: Now approx. > 72 hours out from cardiac
   arrest to determine prognosis. Per neuro, no cold caloric response, no
   doll
s. Per MICU daily exams, pt has no corneal reflexes and now has
   pupils that are utterly fixed and dilated.
   - MR confirms global anoxic brain infarction, and rpt CT scan also
   consistent with anoxic injury and poor prognosis.
   - Continued discussions with Family.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial
   pressures.   ICPs have been in low 50
s this am, but the patient is
   already on high dose sedation and max dose mannitol administered around
   the clock.
   - Continue hyperventilation with goal CO2 28-30, with the intention of
   preventing possible reactive cerebral vasodilation if we were to stop
   hyperventilating pt.
   - Rpt apnea test.
   - Potential to involve palliative care if family continues to have a
   difficult experience making end of life decisions.
   Seizures: resolved
   - Continue Keppra
   #Hypoxia:
   - Cont. current vent settings and wean as tolerated.
   - Bronchoscopy demonstrated copious purulent sputum, and no obvious
   tracheal or bronchial injury.
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC support and will wean based on
   neurologic status as above.
   - VAP bundle
   # Fever:  LLL PNA and GNR in sputum, speciated to Klebsiella sensitive
   to ceftriaxone. In addition Sputum culture growing MSSA and
   enterobacter.
   - Ceftriaxone and Clinda for treatment of Klebsiella PNA and possible
   MSSA started on [**10-5**].
   # Heroin Abuse: dosing sedation medications with addiction history in
   mind, with potential need treat withdrawal symptoms.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and is now in the ICU. He has been intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's neurologic status is poor, with no cold caloric response, no doll's eye reflex, and fixed and dilated pupils. Imaging studies confirm global anoxic brain infarction and a poor prognosis. The patient is on high-dose sedation and maximum dose mannitol to manage intracranial pressures. The plan is to continue hyperventilation to prevent reactive cerebral vasodilation. The patient has copious purulent sputum in the lower left lung field, with Klebsiella identified as the causative organism. Antibiotics have been started, including ceftriaxone for Klebsiella pneumonia and possible MSSA. The patient's heroin abuse history will be considered when dosing sedation medications. Other medical conditions include hemochromatosis, psoriasis, and potential withdrawal symptoms. The patient is DNR/DNI, and discussions with the family regarding prognosis continue.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increasing intracranial pressures: The patient's fixed and dilated pupils, along with poor neurologic status, indicate potential increased intracranial pressures. Monitoring for signs of increasing ICP and intracranial pressures is essential.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient is in a coma and has a poor prognosis due to anoxic brain injury. The goals of care are focused on comfort, providing adequate sedation and pain control, and planning for extubation. 

From the flow sheet data, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/62 mmHg to 147/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's ICP is at -1 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 2,748 mL and output of 2,490 mL.

The physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and no signs of pain. The eyes show no conjunctival edema or abnormal pupils. The cardiovascular assessment indicates normal sinus rhythm, and the respiratory system is clear with no wheezes or crackles. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show trace edema, and there is no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination indicates unresponsiveness, decreased muscle tone, and no spontaneous movement.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, platelet count of 462 K/uL, blood glucose level of 124 mg/dL, sodium level of 112 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated troponin-T, elevated CK, and elevated LDH levels.

The patient has multiple medical complications such as respiratory failure, anoxic brain injury, and poor prognosis. The potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and glycemic control issues."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented to the hospital with respiratory failure and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient is in a coma and has extensive anoxic brain injury with poor prognosis. The family has agreed to focus on comfort care, providing adequate sedation and pain control, and planning for extubation. The patient's condition is critically ill, and the code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). The medical examiner's office has been notified, and the body will be held for review. Family members have been contacted, but they could not be reached immediately.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation and regular mouth care should be implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs (DVT) which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a PE. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation should be considered.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including urinary tract infections and central line-associated bloodstream infections.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and"
