","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced an intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient received atropine and epinephrine during a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now intubated and unresponsive.
- The patient has altered mental status/unresponsiveness, most likely due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- An EEG suggests encephalopathy rather than seizure activity, so anti-epileptics may not be necessary.
- The patient is mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure and will continue to be monitored for any signs of anoxic brain injury.
- The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, with possibilities including hypoglycemia or hypoxia. Tropin I leak and worsening ST depressions on EKG were observed, but ischemia associated with ventricular fibrillation arrest was not confirmed. The EKG has since returned to baseline.
- The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with a hct drop from 36% to 27%. Four units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) have been transfused without an adequate bump in hct. A gastrointestinal consult is recommended for further evaluation"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently went into pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status/Unresponsiveness: The patient's recent intraventricular hemorrhage in the setting of anticoagulation may have contributed to her altered mental status. Hypoxic brain injury due to PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding is also a possible cause. An EEG suggests encephalopathy rather than seizure activity.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection due to unresponsiveness. There is a question of anoxic brain injury. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, and weaning settings will be adjusted as able. A neuro consultation for an EEG to evaluate for anoxic injury is recommended.

3. s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, and there were troponin leaks and worsening ST depressions on EKG. However, the EKG has returned to baseline. Continuous cardiac monitoring is advised.

4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The"

   intraventricular hemorrhage in the setting of anticoagulation for which
   she had been admitted to [**Hospital1 49**] and now was at a nursing home/rehab.  Pt's
   daughter reports that she is mentally clear, without dementia at
   baseline and was in her usual state of mental wellness one hour prior
   to becomign unresponsive last night.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status/unresponsiveness, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypotension, and post-mitral valve replacement (MVR).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Most likely hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed.
2. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting of unresponsiveness. Question of anoxic brain injury.
3. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest; hypoglycemia is a possibility, hypoxia less likely. Troponin leak and worsening ST depressions on EKG; however, ischemia typically associated with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. EKG now back at baseline.

   - Neurology thought was seizing so got EEG and started dilantin and
   ativan. Later neuro consult fellow came by and said encephalopathy on
   eeg no seizures.
   - FSBS 300 so started ISS
   - GI recommended changing to PPI IV BID instead of infusion
   - got 3 units prbcs and 1 unit ffp but still bleeding and hct still
   only 28 so got another unit at 2am.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and experienced pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hypoxic brain injury resulting from a PEA arrest caused by hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning settings should be adjusted as able, and a neuro consult is recommended for an EEG to evaluate for anoxic brain injury.
3. s/p Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest with troponin leak and worsening ST depressions on EKG. However, the EKG is now back at baseline.
4. UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding): The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 36 to 27, despite receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). A GI consult is required for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of"

   normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
   50%) secondary to some dyssynchrony as well as hypokinesis of the basal
   septum. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic
   valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
   valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet
   mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The degree of mitral
   regurgitation seen is normal for this prosthesis. The tricuspid valve

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at the nursing home and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient's altered mental status/unresponsiveness is likely due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. The gastrointestinal consult has been contacted again today and likely needs an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for continued upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and treatment of possible ulcer.

The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to her unresponsiveness. She has been intubated for airway protection and is on mechanical ventilation. The settings will be weaned as able.

The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, with hypoglycemia being a possibility and hypoxia less likely. The echocardiogram does not show evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.

The patient's UGIB is ongoing, with a stable hematocrit level. An EGD has been performed and revealed a clot that could not be removed. The patient is receiving supportive care per gastrointestinal consult"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 123/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's physical examination revealed non-reactive pupils, staccato eye movements, and cool extremities with punctuate lesions on fingertips.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient is most likely experiencing hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. EEG suggests encephalopathy rather than seizure activity, so the utility of anti-epileptics is questionable.
2. Respiratory failure: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. 

The patient underwent a GI scope which revealed a clot in the fundus, and it could not be removed. There are plans to consider repeating the procedure with IV erythromycin.

The patient's HCT is stable at 29, indicating that their hematocrit levels are within normal range.

Neurological examination shows that the patient's exam is consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is likely caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The plan for EEG monitoring, dilantin, and ativan as needed has been agreed upon. The prognosis for prolonged status epilepticus after cardiac arrest is poor.

The ECHO results show severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal left atrium size. The left ventricular cavity size is normal, but there is low normal overall left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 50%) secondary to some dyssynchrony as well as hypokinesis of the basal septum. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets that are moderately thickened, with a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest, most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Most likely hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
3. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting of unresponsiveness. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, with plans to wean settings as able.
4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): Hematocrit (HCT) stable. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed, revealing a clot that could not be removed. Supportive care per GI will be continued. Follow-up EGD"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status/unresponsiveness, likely due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. There is also concern for sepsis, as evidenced by elevated lactate levels and fever. The patient is on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure and has been given zosyn/vanc for suspected infection. Phenytoin has been started for seizure prophylaxis based on the EEG findings.

The patient's cardiac arrest etiology is unclear, with hypoglycemia being a possibility and hypoxia less likely. An echocardiogram has ruled out pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain. No heparin or aspirin has been given due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and requires an EGD for continued UGIB and treatment of possible ulcer. The goal is to maintain a hematocrit level of 30,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient was found unresponsive at a nursing home and experienced pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status/unresponsiveness, respiratory failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and post-mitralectomy (MVR) with subtherapeutic INR. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.7°C, heart rate (HR) of 92 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 123/58 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, fever, and positive cultures for gram-positive cocci (GPC) in 4 out of 4 bottles. This raises concerns for sepsis. The patient's current antibiotic treatment with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but hypoglycemia is a likely cause. There is no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain on echocardiography.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. An electroencephalogram (EEG) suggests encephalopathy rather than seizure activity. Phenytoin therapy is continued per level.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to unresponsiveness. Mechanical ventilation is continued, and weaning settings are being adjusted as able.

4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. He was found unresponsive in his home and experienced a cardiac arrest. After resuscitation, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient suffered from a lack of oxygen to the brain during the cardiac arrest, leading to potential long-term neurological damage.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating poor glycemic control. This may be due to stress, infection, or underlying diabetes.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's lab results show low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, suggesting internal bleeding, possibly from stress ulcers or other causes.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has poor skin assessment, indicating potential pressure ulcers or compromised skin integrity, which can lead to infections.
5. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which required resuscitation efforts. There may be underlying cardiac issues contributing to this event.
6. Ineffective Coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms could be related to the current medical condition, resulting in confusion and delirium.
7. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to the inability to feed orally. Nutritional deficiencies may"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine before being intubated and remaining unresponsive.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Cardiac arrest with unclear etiology, possibly due to hypoglycemia or hypoxia.
- Altered mental status and unresponsiveness, likely caused by hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
- Upper gastrointestinal bleeding with a stable hematocrit level. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned for clot removal.
- Subtherapeutic INR after mitral valve replacement surgery, requiring fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K.
- Poor prognosis according to neurologic assessment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, fever, and positive cultures for Gram-positive cocci (GPC), which raise concerns for sepsis. Discontinuing Zosyn and continuing Vancomycin is recommended.
2. Ulcer bleeding: The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several concerns:

1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but hypoglycemia is considered the most likely cause, with hypoxia being less likely. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: This is most likely due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. EEG results suggest encephalopathy rather than seizure activity, so phenytoin administration will be continued per level. Neurological recommendations will be followed up, and a prognosis of poor outcome is expected. Palliative care consult is recommended.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to unresponsiveness. Mechanical ventilation will be"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a PEA cardiac arrest, which could have been due to hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or an unknown cause. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact etiology.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive, and her altered mental status could be attributed to hypoxic brain injury resulting from the PEA arrest, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to her unresponsiveness. She requires mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function. Weaning settings will be determined based on her condition.

4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has confirmed the presence of a clot that could not be removed. Supportive care will be continued, and further"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness
 most likely hypoxic brain
   injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed
   - OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4bottles, elevated lactate, fever, raise
   concern for sepsis: discontinue zosyn, and continue vanc
   - F/u cultures here
   - EEG suggests encephalopathy rather than seizure activity: continue
   phenytoin per level.
   - Follow up Neuro recs
   - prognosis is poor per neuro
   - Palliative care consult
   - Pt is posturing today, concern for progression, consider head CT
   today will confirm with Neuro first
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of unresponsiveness.
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - wean settings as able
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Cont
   supportive care per GI.
   - Follow GI recs
   - EGD done, clot in esophagus/stomach
   - Goals Hct 30, INR<1.5, Plt >50
   # s/p porcine MVR : INR is currently subtherapeutic s/p FFP and vitamin
   K at OSH for acute UGIB.  With new murmur today
   - Will likely need to start anticoagulation today regardless of UGIB,
   will discuss with GI

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at the nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a PEA cardiac arrest, and the cause is unclear. Hypoglycemia and hypoxia are possible causes, but further evaluation is needed.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive, and an EEG suggests encephalopathy rather than seizure activity. Hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding is a concern. Phenytoin should be continued per level, and follow-up neuro recommendations should be pursued. The prognosis is poor per neuro, and palliative care consult is recommended.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to unresponsiveness. Mechanical ventilation should be continued, and weaning settings should be adjusted as able.

4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a stable hematocrit (Hct) level,"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro attending thought had status epilepticus, bolused and then
   continued PHE and level was 9.6 but free phenytoin in range (15-20).
   Next check should be in a few days with a free phenytoin level and an
   albumin for more accuracy in dosing the phenytoin
   - Neuro also wanted MRI to assess for hypoxic brain injury which was
   done overnight - read pending
   - Gave 1/2 NS for hypernatremia and pm lytes drawn before finished
   running in (only [**1-21**] way through) so recheck tomorrow am. Also gave pm
   k in D5W to fix hypernatremia as well.
   - TTE showed trivial MR (Very limited imaging obtained. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. A bileaflet mitral valve
   prosthesis is present. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   - FSBS in 300s all day so started insulin gtt and added insulin to TPN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and later experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but hypoglycemia is a likely cause. Hypoxia is less likely, and an echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: This could be due to hypoxic brain injury resulting from the PEA arrest caused by hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. An MRI of the head showed diffuse injury.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to unresponsiveness. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, and weaning settings will be adjusted as possible.

4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has stable hemoglobin levels, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has confirmed a clot in the esophagus/stomach"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine but remains intubated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or Bradycardic): The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which could be due to hypoglycemia or hypoxia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness may be attributed to hypoxic brain injury resulting from the PEA arrest, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal bleed. Neurological follow-up recommendations have been made, and palliative care consult is advised due to the poor prognosis.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection due to unresponsiveness. Mechanical ventilation is being continued, and weaning settings will be adjusted as possible.

4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB, and endoscopy revealed a clot that could not be removed. Supportive care per GI recommendations is ongoing, aiming to achieve Hct stability, INR below 1."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent intraventricular hemorrhage.
- The patient was found unresponsive at a nursing home and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.
- The cause of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but hypoglycemia is suspected. Hypoxia is less likely, and an echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.
- The patient has altered mental status and is unresponsive, likely due to hypoxic brain injury from the PEA arrest, possibly caused by hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient is on anti-epileptics due to concern for status epilepticus and has had an MRI of the head done, awaiting read.
- The patient has bacteremia and is on vancomycin, with cultures showing gram-positive cocci in four out of four bottles. There is a concern for sepsis, so vancomycin will be continued, and repeat blood cultures will be done.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest. She received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine but remains unresponsive and intubated. 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status/unresponsiveness, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with a clot in the esophagus/stomach, hypernatremia, and a recent porcine mitral valve replacement (MVR). 

Medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection/sepsis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, fever, and positive cultures for gram-positive cocci, raising concerns for sepsis. Discontinuation of Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and continuation of Vancomycin indicate a possible change in antibiotic therapy.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's prognosis is poor according to the neurology assessment, and there are concerns for progression of encephalopathy or hypoxic brain injury.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB and ongoing clot in the esophagus/stomach. Maintaining a target hemoglobin (Hct) of 30, international normalized"

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at the nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine but remained unresponsive. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest, most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Most likely hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleed. Anti-epileptics were increased due to concern for status epilepticus. An MRI head was done, awaiting read.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia.  Also in
   differential is status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic
   episode, medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she
   received fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting
   however this not likely to be contributing to current presentation
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning settings may be considered as able.

2. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient's urinalysis from 5/15/2024 is positive for infection with pyuria, bacteriuria, and positive leukocyte esterase. They were started on ceftriaxone on 5/15/2024, and urine culture is pending. It is important to continue ceftriaxone and monitor for clinical evidence of infection.

3. Bacteremia: Although the patient's OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4 bottles from 5/11/2024, they are already on vancomycin for staph bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures. Blood cultures here from 5/11/2024 and 5/15/2024 with no growth to date. Vancomycin level is 10.2 this morning. It is recommended to continue vancomycin to complete a 14-day course and recheck blood cultures from 5/15/2024 and 5/16/2024.

4. Low-grade temperature and leukocytosis: The patient's white count has increased to 15.2 from 12K with a Tmax of 99.2 overnight. The"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including altered mental status/unresponsiveness, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), low-grade temperature and leukocytosis, respiratory failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and hypernatremia. She has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone), mechanical ventilation, and supportive care for UGIB.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's recent PEA arrest could potentially recur due to underlying cardiac conditions such as CHF and HOC. Continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and hemodynamic status is crucial.
2. Neurological impairment: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to hypoxic brain injury or prolonged effects from hypoglycemia. Neurological recovery is uncertain, and further neurologic assessment and management are necessary.
3. Infection: The patient has ongoing bacteremia and UTI, which require completion of the prescribed antibiotic courses."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine but remains unresponsive and intubated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but hypoglycemia seems to be the most likely cause. Hypoxia is less likely, and an echo showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain. No heparin or ASA was given due to a potential gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: This could be due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed. An MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia. Other possible etiologies include status epilepticus. Chronic overshunting is also present, but it is unlikely to be contributing to the current presentation.
   - Neuro consult is appreciated, and follow-up neuro recommendations should be implemented.
   - Discuss prognosis of neurological recovery and other possible etiologies with the neuro consultant.
   - Continue phenytoin and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and later experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleed. However, the MRI showed no evidence of ischemia. Other possible etiologies such as status epilepticus should also be considered. Neurological consult is appreciated, and follow-up neuro recommendations are needed.

2. Bacteremia: The patient's OSH cultures showed gram-positive cocci in four out of four bottles from May 11th. She was started on vancomycin on day #5. Blood cultures from May 11th and May 15th have no growth to date. She will continue to receive vancomycin to complete a 14-day course. Follow-up blood cultures from May 15th and May 16th are also needed.

3. UTI: The patient's urinalysis from May 15th was positive for infection with pyuria, bacter"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current assessment, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show abnormalities in sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphate (PO4), and bicarbonate (HCO3) levels. These imbalances may lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, kidney dysfunction, and altered mental status.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are consistently elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This condition can increase the risk of infection, delay wound healing, and contribute to other complications like diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

3. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's MRI head showed slit-like ventricles and chronic over-shunting, chronic white matter disease. These findings suggest possible anoxic brain damage due to inadequate oxygen supply to the brain. This condition can result in cognitive impairment, memory loss, and difficulty with motor functions.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be indicated by melena (black, tarry stools). GI bleeding can lead to hypovolemia, shock, and potential complications such as anemia and organ dysfunction.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin examination is not assessed in the progress note. Imp"

   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia.  Also in
   differential is status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic
   episode, medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she
   received fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting
   however this not likely to be contributing to current presentation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at the nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The assessment and plan section of the note outlines several issues:

1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): The etiology of the arrest is unclear, with possible causes including hypoglycemia and hypoxia. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain. No heparin or aspirin has been given due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: This could be due to hypoxic brain injury resulting from the PEA arrest, prolonged effects from a hypoglycemic episode, medication effects, or status epilepticus. An MRI showed no evidence of ischemia, and there is chronic overshunting.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures from [5-11] and [5-15] have shown growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) in four out of four bottles. Vancomycin levels are being monitored,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine but remains unresponsive. She was intubated due to airway protection. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, respiratory failure, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), low-grade temperature, and leukocytosis. The patient has been diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a need to wean the settings as able. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing bacteremia despite being on vancomycin. Blood cultures are pending, and the dose of vancomycin will be increased.
3. UTI: The patient has a positive urinalysis indicating a urinary tract infection. She is currently on ceftriaxone, and the urine culture is pending.
4. UGIB: The patient had an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which resulted in clotting in the stomach. She is being monitored for any signs of"

She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive. The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, with hypoglycemia being the most likely cause, but hypoxia is less likely. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.

The patient also has an altered mental status and is unresponsive. This could be due to hypoxic brain injury from the PEA arrest, prolonged effects from a hypoglycemic episode, medication effects, or status epilepticus. However, an MRI showed no evidence of ischemia, making chronic overshunting an unlikely contributor to the current presentation. A neurology consult has been requested, and further neurologic recommendations are pending.

Blood cultures from previous days have shown growth of Gram-positive cocci in four out of four bottles, indicating bacteremia. The patient is already on vancomycin, and the dose will be increased to 1g every 12 hours. Blood cultures taken on [**5-15**] and [**5-16**"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia.  Also in
   differential is status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic
   episode, medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she
   received fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting
   however this not likely to be contributing to current presentation.
   Dilantin level is therapeutic
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - d/w neuro re: prognosis of neuro recovery and other possible
   etiologies of current neurological status
   - continue phenytoin at current dose
   - discuss goals of care pending assessment of  patients chance of
   neurological recovery
   - per family request will attempt to arrange transfer to neurologic ICU
   at [**Hospital1 49**].
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter yesterday with interval re-expansion of the
   lung, but still residual moderate sized pneumothorax.
   - continue chest tube to suction
   - appreciate thoracics input, follow recs
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   # Respiratory failure: pt with good gag and cough. Intubated for airway
   protection in the setting of unresponsiveness.
   - cont full vent support
   .
   # Bacteremia: OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4bottles from [**5-11**]. On vanc
   day #6. Blood cultures here from [**5-11**] and [**5-15**] with no growth to date.
   Vamnc level 10.2 yesterday therefore dose increased appropriately
   - continue vancomycin to complete 14 day course
   - recheck vanc level in am
   - f/u blood cx from [**5-15**] and [**5-16**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
 elevated to 400
s after d/c
ing insulin gtt however
   did not receive basal lantus [**5-16**]
   -cont lantus 26U qAM
   -add 20 U insulin to TPN
   -cont SS insulin
   .
   # UTI: Urinalysis from [**5-15**] positive for infection with pyuria,
   bacturia and positive leukocyte esterase. Was started on ceftriaxone on
   [**5-15**], Urine culture showed only yeast
   - continue ceftriaxone (day #1 =[**5-15**]) day [**3-23**]
   .
   # Low grade temperature and leukocytosis: White count continues to rise
   to 19K today from 15.2 with Tmax of 100.2. Differential diagnosis of
   infectious process is broad and includes VAP, C Diff or other GI
   infection. CXR with no evidence of focal consolidation. Sputum gram
   stain negative for organisms, culture pending. Retrocardiac opacity
   most likely atelectasis but will follow imaging closely. Already on
   vanc for staph bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures and
   ceftriaxone for UTI
   - monitor for clinical evidence of infection
   - repeat chest X-ray today
   - f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture
   - consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates
   - trend WBC
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Cont
   supportive care per GI. No further episodes of melena/hematemesis since
   [**5-13**]. Hct has remained stable
   - Goals Hct 30, INR<1.5, Plt >50
   -PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor for signs of active bleeding
   - daily Hct

   # s/p porcine MVR : INR is currently subtherapeutic s/p FFP and vitamin
   K at OSH for acute UGIB.  TTE with only trace MR
   - hold anticoagulation for now given GI bleed
   # Hypernatremia:  Improved.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest, which was treated with atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

The patient has multiple medical complications including:
1. Cardiac arrest of unclear etiology, most likely related to hypoglycemia. She received atropine and epinephrine during the arrest.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness, potentially due to hypoxic brain injury, status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode, or medication effect.
3. Bacteremia with GPC detected in surveillance cultures from 5/11. She was started on vancomycin and the dose was increased due to a high vancomycin level.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive urinalysis from 5/15 showing infection, pyuria, and bacteriuria. She is being treated with ceftriaxone.
5. Low-grade temperature and leukocytosis, possibly indicative of a new infectious process such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection, or other gastrointestinal infection.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The differential diagnosis includes hypoxic brain injury, status epilepticus, prolonged effects from a hypoglycemic episode, and medication effects. An MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia, and the patient has chronic overshunting which is not likely contributing to the current presentation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine before being intubated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest, most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed. However, an MRI showed no evidence of ischemia. Other possible etiologies include status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode, medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [5-14]. Follow-up neuro recommendations.
3. Bacteremia: OSH cultures showed gram-positive cocci (GPC) in 4/4 bottles from [5-11]. On vancomycin day #5. Blood cultures here from [5-11] and [5-15]"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest, most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleed, however MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia. Also in differential is status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode, medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [5-14] when she received fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this not likely to be contributing to current presentation.
3. Bacteremia: OSH cultures show Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in 4/4"

   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia.  Also in
   differential is status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic
   episode, medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she
   received fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting
   however this not likely to be contributing to current presentation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic) for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:
1. Cardiac arrest: The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but hypoglycemia and hypoxia are considered likely causes. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The cause is still uncertain, with possible contributing factors including hypoxic brain injury, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode, medication effect, or status epilepticus. An MRI showed no evidence of ischemia, and Dilantin level is therapeutic.
3. Pneumothorax: A large left-sided pneumothorax was identified on chest X-ray, likely secondary to subclavian line placement. Thoracic surgery placed a pigtail catheter, leading to some lung re-expansion, but there is still a moderate-sized pneumothorax present.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has good gag and cough reflexes but required int"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), altered mental status, anoxic brain damage, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac arrest. The patient is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has been started on antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 111/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal kidney function. The patient's glucose level is elevated at 468 mg/dL. The patient's physical examination reveals swollen legs and limited peripheral pulses. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's swollen legs and DVT increase the risk of a pulmonary embolism, which can be a life-threatening complication.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which could progress to sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for developing a wound infection, especially if he has any breaks in his skin.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia.  Also in
   differential is status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic
   episode, medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she
   received fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting
   however this not likely to be contributing to current presentation.
   Dilantin level is therapeutic

   etiologies of current neurological status
   - continue phenytoin at current dose

   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter yesterday with interval re-expansion of the
   lung, but still residual moderate sized pneumothorax.
   - continue chest tube to suction
   - appreciate thoracics input, follow recs
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   # Respiratory failure: pt with good gag and cough. Intubated for airway
   protection in the setting of unresponsiveness.

   infectious process is broad and includes VAP, C Diff or other GI
   infection. CXR with no evidence of focal consolidation. Sputum gram
   stain negative for organisms, culture pending. Retrocardiac opacity
   most likely atelectasis but will follow imaging closely. Already on
   vanc for staph bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures and
   ceftriaxone for UTI

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Cardiac arrest: The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but it is likely related to hypoglycemia. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, which may contribute to her cardiac status.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The cause of the altered mental status is unclear. Possible causes include hypoxic brain injury, status epilepticus, prolonged effects from hypoglycemia, medication effects, or overshunting of her ventricular shunt. Further assessment and consultation with neurology are recommended.

3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a moderate-sized pneumothorax that has been managed with a pigtail catheter. This was likely secondary to subclavian line placement. Continuing chest tube to suction and daily CXR are advised.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on full ventilatory support due to"

She is now intubated and unresponsive.

The patient has several medical complications:
1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but hypoglycemia seems to be a likely cause. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain on echocardiography.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient may have hypoxic brain injury due to the PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleed. However, an MRI showed no evidence of ischemia. Other possible causes include status epilepticus, prolonged effects from hypoglycemia, medication effects, and chronic overshunting of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. The VP shunt was tapped yesterday to rule out central nervous system (CNS) infection, but no evidence of infection was found.
3. Pneumothorax: A chest X-ray on [5-16] showed a pneumothorax likely secondary to subclavian"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped yesterday to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - d/w neuro re: prognosis of neuro recovery and other possible
   etiologies of current neurological status
   - phenytion level pending this am, continue phenytoin to maintain level
   15-20
   - discuss goals of care pending assessment of  patients chance of
   neurological recovery
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter yesterday with interval re-expansion of the
   lung, but still residual moderate sized pneumothorax.
   - pigtail at water seal overnight
   - fup CXR and thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail.
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   # LUE clot:  pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   Discussed anticoagulation with neurology given previous intracranial
   hemorrhage and they felt it would be safe to resume anticoagulation.
   - EGD to eval mucosa for safety of anticoagulation given previous upper
   GIB.
   - anticoagulation with heparin gtt.
   - d/c subclavian line after anticoagulation initiated.
   # Respiratory failure: pt with good gag and cough. Intubated for airway
   protection in the setting of unresponsiveness.
   - cont full vent support
   .
   # Bacteremia: OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4bottles from [**5-11**]. On vanc
   day #6. Blood cultures here from [**5-11**] and [**5-15**] with no growth to date.
   Vamnc level 10.2 yesterday therefore dose increased appropriately
   - continue vancomycin to complete 14 day course
   - recheck vanc level in am
   - f/u blood cx from [**5-15**] and [**5-16**]
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
 elevated to 400
s after d/c

   # UTI: Urinalysis from [**5-15**] positive for infection with pyuria,
   bacturia and positive leukocyte esterase. Was started on ceftriaxone on
   [**5-15**], Urine culture showed only yeast
   - continue ceftriaxone (day #1 =[**5-15**]) day [**3-23**]
   .
   # Low grade temperature and leukocytosis: White count continues to rise
   to 19K today from 15.2 with Tmax of 100.2. Differential diagnosis of
   infectious process is broad and includes VAP, C Diff or other GI
   infection. CXR with no evidence of focal consolidation. Sputum gram
   stain negative for organisms, culture pending. Retrocardiac opacity
   most likely atelectasis but will follow imaging closely. Already on
   vanc for staph bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures and
   ceftriaxone for UTI
   - monitor for clinical evidence of infection
   - f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture
   - consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates
   - trend WBC
   - TEE for endocarditis
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Cont
   supportive care per GI. No further episodes of melena/hematemesis since
   [**5-13**]. Hct has remained stable
   - Goals Hct 30, INR<1.5, Plt >50

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped yesterday to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - d/w neuro re: prognosis of neuro recovery and other possible
   etiologies of current neurological status

   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter yesterday with interval re-expansion of the
   lung, but still residual moderate sized pneumothorax. Pigtail at water
   seal overnight. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail.
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   # LUE clot:  pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   Discussed anticoagulation with neurology given previous intracranial
   hemorrhage and they felt it would be safe to resume anticoagulation.
   Discussed with GI who also do not oppose anti-coagulation but would
   like repeat EGD prior to initiation of this therapy
   - EGD today to eval mucosa for safety of anticoagulation given previous
   upper GIB.
   - anticoagulation with heparin gtt after EGD
   - d/c subclavian line after anticoagulation initiated.
   # Respiratory failure: pt with good gag and cough. Intubated for airway
   protection in the setting of unresponsiveness.

   - continue ceftriaxone (day #1 =[**5-15**]) day [**4-23**]
   .
   # Low grade temperature and leukocytosis: White count continues at 19K
   today with Tmax of 100.6. Differential diagnosis of infectious process
   is broad and includes VAP, C Diff or other GI infection. CXR with no
   evidence of focal consolidation. Sputum gram stain negative for
   organisms, culture pending. Retrocardiac opacity most likely
   atelectasis but will follow imaging closely. Already on vanc for staph
   bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures and ceftriaxone for UTI
   - monitor for clinical evidence of infection
   - f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture
   - consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates

She is now intubated and unresponsive.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest, most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed, however MRI yesterday showed no evidence of ischemia. Also in differential is status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode, medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [5-14] when she received fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this not likely to be contributing to current presentation.
3. Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [5-16] likely secondary to subclavian line placement on [5-12]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed pigtail catheter yesterday with interval"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped yesterday to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.

   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter yesterday with interval re-expansion of the
   lung, but still residual moderate sized pneumothorax. Pigtail at water
   seal overnight. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail.
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   # LUE clot:  pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   Discussed anticoagulation with neurology given previous intracranial
   hemorrhage and they felt it would be safe to resume anticoagulation.
   Discussed with GI who also do not oppose anti-coagulation but would
   like repeat EGD prior to initiation of this therapy
   - EGD today to eval mucosa for safety of anticoagulation given previous
   upper GIB.
   - anticoagulation with heparin gtt after EGD
   - d/c subclavian line after anticoagulation initiated.
   # Respiratory failure: pt with good gag and cough. Intubated for airway
   protection in the setting of unresponsiveness.
   - cont full vent support

   bacturia and positive leukocyte esterase. Was started on ceftriaxone on
   [**5-15**], Urine culture showed only yeast
   - continue ceftriaxone (day #1 =[**5-15**]) day [**4-23**]
   .
   # Low grade temperature and leukocytosis: White count continues at 19K
   today with Tmax of 100.6. Differential diagnosis of infectious process
   is broad and includes VAP, C Diff or other GI infection. CXR with no
   evidence of focal consolidation. Sputum gram stain negative for
   organisms, culture pending. Retrocardiac opacity most likely
   atelectasis but will follow imaging closely. Already on vanc for staph
   bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures and ceftriaxone for UTI
   - monitor for clinical evidence of infection
   - f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture
   - consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's initial PEA cardiac arrest may recur due to underlying conditions such as HOCM, CHF, or atrial fibrillation.
2. Altered Mental Status/Unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness could be attributed to hypoxic brain injury, prolonged effects from hypoglycemia, medication effects, or status epilepticus.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures showing GPC in 4/4 bottles, suggesting a bacterial infection that needs to be addressed.
4. Pneumothorax: The patient has a moderate-sized pneumothorax secondary to subclavian line placement, which requires close monitoring and potential intervention.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed large DVT in the left upper extremity, necessitating anticoagulation therapy.
6. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of valve replacement (mechanical mitral valve) admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been complex and unstable, with multiple medical complications. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has had various interventions including chest tube placement, endoscopic gastrointestinal debridement (EGD), and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains febrile with a temperature of 101.2°F. There have been fluctuations in his white blood cell count and platelet count, indicating possible infection and bleeding risks. His blood glucose levels have been elevated, and he has shown signs of malnutrition. The patient's mental status has been altered, and there is evidence of hyperglycemia and anoxic brain damage. Additionally, there are concerns about impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, and cardiac arrest. The patient's current medications include heparin, dilantin, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and metoprolol. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:

   EGD ([**2124-5-19**]): A large organized clot was seen in the fundus which is
   slightly smaller in size compared to previously seen clot during the
   endoscopy finding 1 week ago. Unable to see underneath of the clot to
   rule out ulceration. The clot was not dislodged due to very high risk
   of bleeding.
   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped  to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o infection.

   EGD ([**2124-5-19**]): A large organized clot was seen in the fundus which is
   slightly smaller in size compared to previously seen clot during the
   endoscopy finding 1 week ago. Unable to see underneath of the clot to
   rule out ulceration. The clot was not dislodged due to very high risk
   of bleeding.
   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped  to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o infection.
   -neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   -d/w neuro re: prognosis of neuro recovery
   -PSV trial given that she has adeq. gag and cough reflexes and was
   intubated for airway protection
   -phenytoin level pending this am, continue phenytoin to maintain level

 d/w neuro re:need for phenytoin given no e/o seizure activity
   - arrange for multidisciplinary  family discussion today
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation
   -If rebleeds, will need surgical intervention per GI

   gram stain negative for organisms, culture pending. TEE negative. C
   Diff negative. CT sinus with some mild thickening. On vanc for staph
   bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures and ceftriaxone for UTI

   # s/p mechanical MVR : TEE yesterday showed mechanical valve further
   supporting need for anticoagulation. Started on heparin on [**5-18**]
   - cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Repeat EGD showed residual organized clot and GI recommended
   against anti-coagulation. Head CT negative for bleed, neurology not
   opposed to anti-coagulation. After discussion of risk vs benefit, it
   was decided to initiate anti-coagulation yesterday with heparin. pt
   will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   -cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   -d/c subclavian line and send for cx

   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter. Pigtail at water seal. CXR stable

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, intubated, and now unresponsive.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest with unclear etiology. Hypoglycemia is a likely cause, while hypoxia is less likely. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.

2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive and has altered mental status. Possible causes include hypoxic brain injury due to PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding. However, an MRI showed no evidence of ischemia. Other differentials include status epilepticus, prolonged effects from hypoglycemic episodes, and medication effects. Dilantin levels are therapeutic, and there is no evidence of infection in the cerebrospinal fluid.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient had an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which was identified by a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD"

   EGD ([**2124-5-19**]): A large organized clot was seen in the fundus which is
   slightly smaller in size compared to previously seen clot during the
   endoscopy finding 1 week ago. Unable to see underneath of the clot to
   rule out ulceration. The clot was not dislodged due to very high risk
   of bleeding.
   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped  to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o infection.

   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation

   supporting need for anticoagulation. Started on heparin on [**5-18**]
   - cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Repeat EGD showed residual organized clot and GI recommended
   against anti-coagulation. Head CT negative for bleed, neurology not
   opposed to anti-coagulation. After discussion of risk vs benefit, it
   was decided to initiate anti-coagulation yesterday with heparin. pt
   will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   -cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   -d/c subclavian line and send for cx

   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter. Pigtail at water seal. CXR stable

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (Afib). She was found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She is currently intubated and unresponsive. The patient has multiple medical complications including upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), fever with leukocytosis, a mechanical mitral valve (MVR), pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypothyroidism, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left upper extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract due to the presence of a large organized clot in the fundus of the stomach, which poses a high risk of bleeding.
2. Infection, as indicated by fever and leukocytosis. The source of infection could be the urinary tract, respiratory system, or central nervous system.
3. Thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, due to the mechanical heart valve and immobilization.
4. Hypoglycemia, which can occur due to insulin therapy or other medications.
5. Neurological deterioration, given the patient's altered mental status and the possibility of hypoxic brain injury from the P"

   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.

   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level

   H+P, A+P.  Remains obtunded, critically ill.  Requires anticoagulation
   for mechanical MV and upper extremity DVT but has moderate-sized,
   recently active GI blled.  We have reinstituted heparin and will
   monitor hct closely.   On antibiotics for recent bacteremia although
   subsequent blood cultures have been negative.  ID w/u is underway for
   persistent low grade temp.  Neuro status is unchanged.  She continues
   to have a very poor prognosis for meaningful neurological recovery.
   An extensive ~ 60 minute family meeting occurred today with the family,
   CCU team, and neuro team.  The family was provided with a thorough
   update on her status and prognosis.  They understand that certain
   options, such as surgical treatment of her GI bleed are not feasible.
   They continue to hope for some recovery.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, now intubated and unresponsive. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with persistent clot in the fundus of the stomach, mechanical mitral valve replacement, pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hypothyroidism. She is currently receiving various treatments and medications to manage these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract due to the presence of a persistent clot in the stomach fundus. This could lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity due to subclavian line placement. This could potentially result in a pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
3. Infection due to prolonged use of invasive lines and devices, including central venous catheters and urinary catheters.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
5. Poor neurological recovery despite the mechanical ventilation and other supportive measures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage.
- She was found unresponsive at the nursing home and went into pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine.
- She is now intubated and unresponsive.
- The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including a large organized clot in the fundus of her stomach, which is smaller in size compared to the previous clot seen during an endoscopy one week ago.
- She also has a pneumothorax identified on chest X-ray, likely secondary to subclavian line placement, and has undergone pigtail catheter placement.
- She has extensive clot formation in her left upper extremity, likely related to subclavian line placement, and is currently on anticoagulation therapy with heparin.
- She has respiratory failure and is on full ventilator support.
- She has bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, for which she is being treated with vancomycin.
- She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by yeast, for which she is being treated with ceftriaxone.
- She has low-grade temperature and leukocytosis,"

   rule out ulceration. The clot was not dislodged due to very high risk
   of bleeding.
   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive at nursing home went into PEA for which
   received atropine and muptiple dose of epi now intubated and
   unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped yesterday to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - d/w neuro re: prognosis of neuro recovery and other possible
   etiologies of current neurological status
   - phenytion level pending this am, continue phenytoin to maintain level
   15-20
   - discuss goals of care pending assessment of  patients chance of
   neurological recovery
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter yesterday with interval re-expansion of the
   lung, but still residual moderate sized pneumothorax. Pigtail at water
   seal overnight. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail.
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   # LUE clot:  pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   Discussed anticoagulation with neurology given previous intracranial
   hemorrhage and they felt it would be safe to resume anticoagulation.
   Discussed with GI who also do not oppose anti-coagulation but would
   like repeat EGD prior to initiation of this therapy
   - EGD today to eval mucosa for safety of anticoagulation given previous
   upper GIB.
   - anticoagulation with heparin gtt after EGD
   - d/c subclavian line after anticoagulation initiated.
   # Respiratory failure: pt with good gag and cough. Intubated for airway
   protection in the setting of unresponsiveness.
   - cont full vent support

   # Bacteremia: OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4bottles from [**5-11**]. On vanc
   day #7. Blood cultures here from [**5-11**] and [**5-15**] with no growth to date.
   Vanc level 23 this am after adjusting dose 2 days ago
   - decrease vancomycin to 750mg q12h. Cont abx to complete 14 day course
   - recheck vanc level in 48 hours

   - continue ceftriaxone (day #1 =[**5-15**]) day [**4-23**]
   .
   # Low grade temperature and leukocytosis: White count continues at 19K
   today with Tmax of 100.6. Differential diagnosis of infectious process
   is broad and includes VAP, C Diff or other GI infection. CXR with no
   evidence of focal consolidation. Sputum gram stain negative for
   organisms, culture pending. Retrocardiac opacity most likely
   atelectasis but will follow imaging closely. Already on vanc for staph
   bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures and ceftriaxone for UTI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest for which she received atropine and multiple doses of epinephrine. She is currently intubated and unresponsive.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but hypoglycemia is a likely cause. Hypoxia is less likely. An echo showed no evidence of pericardial effusion or right ventricular strain.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The likely causes include hypoxic brain injury due to PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, but MRI showed no evidence of ischemia. Other possibilities include status epilepticus, prolonged effects from hypoglycemic episodes, or medication effects. The patient has a VP shunt, and it was tapped yesterday to rule out CNS infection, which showed no evidence of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped  to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o infection.
   -neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   -d/w neuro re: prognosis of neuro recovery
   -PSV trial given that she has adeq. gag and cough reflexes and was
   intubated for airway protection
   -phenytoin level pending this am, continue phenytoin to maintain level
   15-20
 d/w neuro re:need for phenytoin given no e/o seizure activity
   - arrange for multidisciplinary  family discussion today
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation
   -If rebleeds, will need surgical intervention per GI
   - xfuse for Hct <30
   -[**Hospital1 **] Hct
   -active T&C
   -PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -monitor closely for signs of active bleeding
   .
   #Fever/ leukocytosis: White count continues at 18K today with Tmax of
   101.2. CXR with retrocardiac no evidence of focal consolidation. Sputum
   gram stain negative for organisms, culture pending. TEE negative. C
   Diff negative. CT sinus with some mild thickening. On vanc for staph
   bacteremia with negative surveillance cultures and ceftriaxone for UTI
   (adeq. Cov
g for septic thrombophlebitis)
    -CT torso to look for focal infection
   -recheck c. diff
   -send subclavian line for Cx
   -f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture
   -consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates
   -trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # s/p mechanical MVR : TEE yesterday showed mechanical valve further
   supporting need for anticoagulation. Started on heparin on [**5-18**]
   - cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Repeat EGD showed residual organized clot and GI recommended
   against anti-coagulation. Head CT negative for bleed, neurology not
   opposed to anti-coagulation. After discussion of risk vs benefit, it
   was decided to initiate anti-coagulation yesterday with heparin. pt
   will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   -cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   -d/c subclavian line and send for cx
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter. Pigtail at water seal. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail catheter
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
 suboptimally controlled
   -cont lantus 26U qAM
   -incr. insulin in TPN
   -cont SS insulin
   .
   # Bacteremia: OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4bottles from [**5-11**] with meth
   resistant staph epi. On vanc day #8. Blood cultures here from [**5-11**] and
   [**5-15**], [**5-16**] with no growth to date. TEE with no evidence of valvular

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of valve replacement, currently admitted to the ICU for fever, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been experiencing spikes in temperature and leukocytosis, as well as liquid stools that are melanotic but of small volume. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending up, and she has been treated with ceftriaxone, which has now been stopped. Due to the inability to obtain peripheral access, a subclavian line has been placed. A CT scan showed no evidence of infection but revealed a common iliac to femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's family is discussing end-of-life decisions, with the son being more decisive than the daughter. The patient continues to have a pigtails on water seal and has experienced transient hypotension to 77 after receiving lasix. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and liquid stools suggest a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The CT scan revealed a DVT from the common iliac to femoral area, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's LFTs are trending up, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Additionally, the elevated lactate level"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of valve replacement, specifically mitral mechanical valve replacement (MVR). The patient is experiencing fever, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, ineffective coping, hyperglycemia, anoxic brain damage, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac arrest. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 99/45 mmHg to 132/86 mmHg, heart rate between 81 and 87 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 460 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals that peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments are not documented. 

The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin), heparin sodium, furosemide, dilantin, metoprolol, and pantopraz"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o infection.
   Family meeting yesterday to discuss goals of care, no change in plan of
   care at this time.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - PSV trial given that she has adeq. gag and cough reflexes and was
   intubated for airway protection
   - continue phenytoin to maintain level 15-20, level pending from this
   am
   - continue to communicate with family re:goals of care
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation
   - transfuse for Hct <30
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - active T&C
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor closely for signs of active bleeding
   .
   #Fever/ leukocytosis: Tmax of 101, but afebrile this am.. Extensive
   work-up unrevealing for infectious source including CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
   yesterday
   - f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture, C Diff
   - consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - consider ID consult today depending on goals of care
   .
   # s/p mechanical MVR : TEE showed mechanical valve further supporting
   need for anticoagulation. Started on heparin on [**5-18**]
   - cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Also had iliac
 femoral clot on CT thorax. Subclavian line
   still in place. Pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   - cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter. Pigtail at water seal. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail catheter
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: better control after increasing insulin in TPN
   yesterday
   -cont lantus 26U qAM

She was found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and was intubated. She has been unresponsive since then.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature of 101.2°F (38.3°C), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/45 mmHg to 132/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Neurologic status: Unresponsive with decerebrate posturing, no purposeful movements, and upgoing toes bilaterally.
- Respiratory support: Currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 460 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, respiratory system resistance of 120, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- Laboratory results: WBC count of 15.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.0%, platelet count of 139 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose of 125 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-) levels.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has multiple ongoing issues including altered mental status/unresponsiveness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), fever with leukocytosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, bacteremia, and hypothyroidism.

For altered mental status/unresponsiveness, the likely causes include hypoxic brain injury due to PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleed, but MRI showed no evidence of ischemia. Other possibilities include status epilepticus, prolonged effects from hypoglycemic episode, and medication effect.

Regarding UGIB, the patient has stable hemoglobin levels and an organizing clot in the stomach that could not be removed. Supportive care is being provided, and transfusion is considered if hemoglobin drops below 30.

The patient has also been diagnosed with DVT in the left upper extremity and iliac-femoral region, likely related to subclavian line placement. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin is initiated and will be continued for at least three months.

A pneumothorax was identified on chest X-ray, likely secondary to subclavian line placement. A pigtail catheter was placed, and the patient is currently at water seal. Close follow-up with thoracic surgery is recommended to evaluate for possible removal of the pigtail"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped  to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o infection.
   Family meeting yesterday to discuss goals of care, no change in plan of
   care at this time.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - PSV trial given that she has adeq. gag and cough reflexes and was
   intubated for airway protection
   - continue phenytoin to maintain level 15-20
   - continue to communicate with family re:goals of care
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation
   - xfuse for Hct <30
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - active T&C
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor closely for signs of active bleeding

   -f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture, C Diff
   -consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates
   -trend WBC, fever curve
   -consider ID consult today depending on goals of care
   .
   # s/p mechanical MVR : TEE yesterday showed mechanical valve further
   supporting need for anticoagulation. Started on heparin on [**5-18**]
   - cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   -cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter. Pigtail at water seal. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail catheter
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Cardiac arrest (PEA or ?bradycardic): Unclear etiology for arrest:
   most likely hypoglycemia, hypoxia less likely. Echo with no evidence of
   pericardial effusion or rv strain.
   - no heparin or ASA given GI bleed
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt,
   shunt was tapped  to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o infection.
   Family meeting yesterday to discuss goals of care, no change in plan of
   care at this time.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She is intubated and unresponsive. The patient has multiple medical complications including cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic), altered mental status/unresponsiveness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), fever/leukocytosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, bacteremia, hypothyroidism, and mechanical mitral valve replacement. The patient requires continuous monitoring and treatment for these conditions. The family is considering withdrawal of life support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest (PEA or bradycardic): The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which could be due to hypoglycemia or hypoxia. It is crucial to monitor the patient's cardiac function closely.
2. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive and has altered mental status, which may be due to hypoxic brain injury, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode, medication effect, or status epilepticus. Neurological consultation is recommended.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient had a UGIB, and a clot"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with mech MVR, PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent
   intraventricular hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA
   arrest, now intubated and unresponsive.
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is slightly sub therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and
   VP shunt, shunt was tapped to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.  Family meeting yesterday to discuss goals of care, no
   change in plan of care at this time.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - continue phenytoin to maintain level 15-20, slightly low this am
   adjusted for albumin; will adjust per neuro
   - continue to communicate with family re:goals of care
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation
   - transfuse for Hct <30
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - active T&C
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor closely for signs of active bleeding
   .
   #Fever/ leukocytosis: Tmax of 101, but afebrile this am.. Extensive
   work-up unrevealing for infectious source including CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
   yesterday
   - f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture, C Diff
   - consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - consider ID consult today depending on goals of care
   .
   # s/p mechanical MVR : TEE showed mechanical valve further supporting
   need for anticoagulation. Started on heparin on [**5-18**]
   - cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Also had iliac
 femoral clot on CT thorax. Subclavian line
   still in place. Pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   - cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter. Pigtail at water seal. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail catheter
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: better control after increasing insulin in TPN
   yesterday
   -cont lantus 26U qAM
   -cont 36U insulin in TPN
   -cont SS insulin
   .
   # Bacteremia: OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4bottles from [**5-11**] with MRSE.
   On vanc day #9. Blood cultures here from [**5-11**] and [**5-15**], [**5-16**] with no
   growth to date. TEE with no evidence of valvular vegetation
   - cont vancomycin 750mg q12h to complete a 14 day course or possibly
   longer per ID consult considering mechanical valve.
   - f/u vanc level from this am, adjust dose appropriately
   - f/u blood cx from [**5-15**], [**5-16**], [**5-17**], [**5-18**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, now intubated and unresponsive. The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hypoxic brain injury from PEA arrest, hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, status epilepticus, prolonged effects from hypoglycemic episode, or medication effect. An MRI without evidence of ischemia was performed, ruling out hypoxic brain injury. Dilantin level is slightly subtherapeutic, and neuro consult recommendations should be followed.

2. UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding): The patient had an EGD that showed a clot that could not be removed, and repeat EGD showed residual organizing clot. The patient is at high risk for rebleeding given the appearance of the clot in the fundus and initiation of anticoagulation. Transfuse for Hct <30, active T&C, PPI, and monitor closely for signs of active bleeding.

3. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient had a Tmax of 101, but is"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is slightly sub therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and
   VP shunt, shunt was tapped to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.  Family meeting yesterday to discuss goals of care, no
   change in plan of care at this time.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - continue phenytoin to maintain level 15-20, slightly low this am
   adjusted for albumin; will adjust per neuro
   - continue to communicate with family re:goals of care
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation
   - transfuse for Hct <30
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - active T&C
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor closely for signs of active bleeding
   .
   #Fever/ leukocytosis: Tmax of 101, but afebrile this am.. Extensive
   work-up unrevealing for infectious source including CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
   yesterday
   - f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture, C Diff
   - consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - consider ID consult today depending on goals of care
   .
   # s/p mechanical MVR : TEE showed mechanical valve further supporting
   need for anticoagulation. Started on heparin on [**5-18**]
   - cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Also had iliac
 femoral clot on CT thorax. Subclavian line
   still in place. Pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   - cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter. Pigtail at water seal. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail catheter
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: better control after increasing insulin in TPN
   yesterday
   -cont lantus 26U qAM
   -cont 36U insulin in TPN
   -cont SS insulin
   .
   # Bacteremia: OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4bottles from [**5-11**] with MRSE.
   On vanc day #9. Blood cultures here from [**5-11**] and [**5-15**], [**5-16**] with no
   growth to date. TEE with no evidence of valvular vegetation
   - cont vancomycin 750mg q12h to complete a 14 day course or possibly
   longer per ID consult considering mechanical valve.
   - f/u vanc level from this am, adjust dose appropriately
   - f/u blood cx from [**5-15**], [**5-16**], [**5-17**], [**5-18**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient was found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and is currently intubated and unresponsive.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive and has altered mental status. The cause could be hypoxic brain injury due to PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, but an MRI showed no evidence of ischemia. Other possible causes include status epilepticus, prolonged effect from the hypoglycemic episode, or medication effect. The patient's last dose of sedation was on [5-14] when she received fentanyl bolus for MRI. Dilantin level is slightly subtherapeutic. Given low-grade fevers with bacteremia and VP shunt, the shunt was tapped to rule out CNS infection and showed no evidence of infection. The family meeting yesterday discussed goals of care, with no change in the plan of care at this time.

2. UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding): The patient had a significant UGIB episode, and an EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy) confirmed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU for valve replacement surgery. He has a history of valve replacement, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The patient presents with fever, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, anoxic brain damage, gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate an infection. It is important to consider the possibility of hospital-acquired infections, especially since the patient has been in the ICU for an extended period.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could also be due to delirium, which is a common complication in ICU patients. Delirium can be caused by various factors such as medications, infections, or metabolic imbalances.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels may lead to hypoglycemia if insulin or other antidiabetic medications are administered. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake and output discrepancy, indicating a potential fluid imbalance. This could contribute to complications like pulmonary edema or renal dysfunction.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate skin care are crucial to prevent further skin breakdown.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support indicates the"

   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is slightly sub therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and
   VP shunt, shunt was tapped to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.  Family meeting yesterday to discuss goals of care, no
   change in plan of care at this time.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, intubated, and unresponsive. The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status/unresponsiveness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), fever with leukocytosis, mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR), left upper extremity (LUE) clot, pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, bacteremia, hypothyroidism, and multiple lines and drains.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB with residual organizing clot in the stomach. She is at high risk for rebleeding, especially since anti-coagulation therapy has been initiated.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has extensive clot formation likely related to subclavian line placement, as well as an iliac-femoral clot on CT thorax. She will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months to prevent further clot formation and potential DVT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of valve replacement surgery (mitral mechanical valve replacement). The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and changes in nutrition. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/36 mmHg to 127/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including heparin sodium, metoprolol, dilantin, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and altered mental status could indicate an infection, which may be hospital-acquired or related to the surgical procedure.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium, which is a common complication in ICU patients.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, but there is a risk of developing hypoglycemia if insulin or other antidiabetic medications are administered.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 947 mL, indicating potential fluid overload.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, which can be exacerbated by medications such as anticoagulants or stress ulcers.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
8. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, which puts him at high risk for recurrent events.

Please note that these are potential medical complications based on the information provided, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt causing intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia leading to pulseless electrical activity arrest, unresponsiveness with severe encephalopathy, left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and fever of unclear etiology.

24-hour events include ID consult recommended, likely endovascular source (clot vs valve) with antibiotic therapy, fungal blood culture, ESR/CRP, urine AFB for bladder TB, CTA for pulmonary embolism, RUQ ultrasound, changing dilantin if neuro agrees, and removing subclavian line for culture.

The patient received a phenytoin bolus per neuro recommendations, with a repeat level of 9.9 corrected for albumin 16 (within therapeutic range). She was given one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 26.1 to 28.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, which confers a dismal prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent intraventricular
   hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA arrest, now
   intubated and unresponsive.
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is slightly sub therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and
   VP shunt, shunt was tapped to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.  Family meeting yesterday to discuss goals of care, no
   change in plan of care at this time.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - continue phenytoin to maintain level 15-20, slightly low this am
   adjusted for albumin; will adjust per neuro
   - continue to communicate with family re:goals of care
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation
   - transfuse for Hct <30
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - active T&C
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor closely for signs of active bleeding
   .
   #Fever/ leukocytosis: Tmax of 101, but afebrile this am.. Extensive
   work-up unrevealing for infectious source including CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
   yesterday
   - f/u sputum, pleural fluid culture, C Diff
   - consider Zosyn for VAP if clinically deteriorates
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - consider ID consult today depending on goals of care
   .
   # s/p mechanical MVR : TEE showed mechanical valve further supporting
   need for anticoagulation. Started on heparin on [**5-18**]
   - cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Also had iliac
 femoral clot on CT thorax. Subclavian line
   still in place. Pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   - cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and
   placed pigtail catheter. Pigtail at water seal. CXR stable
   - f/u thoracics recs to eval for possible d/c of pigtail catheter
   - daily CXR and mixed venous gas
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: better control after increasing insulin in TPN
   yesterday
   -cont lantus 26U qAM
   -cont 36U insulin in TPN
   -cont SS insulin
   .
   # Bacteremia: OSH cultures show GPC in 4/4bottles from [**5-11**] with MRSE.
   On vanc day #9. Blood cultures here from [**5-11**] and [**5-15**], [**5-16**] with no
   growth to date. TEE with no evidence of valvular vegetation
   - cont vancomycin 750mg q12h to complete a 14 day course or possibly
   longer per ID consult considering mechanical valve.
   - f/u vanc level from this am, adjust dose appropriately
   - f/u blood cx from [**5-15**], [**5-16**], [**5-17**], [**5-18**]
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Elevated TSH of 8 with slightly low free T 4 (0.9).
   Was started on thyroid replacement
   - cont levothyroxine

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for the patient. These include:

1. UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding): The patient has a history of UGIB, and although the bleeding has been controlled, there is still a risk of rebleeding due to the presence of a clot in the fundus. The patient will require continued supportive care and monitoring for signs of active bleeding.

2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever and leukocytosis, but further investigations did not reveal an infectious source. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's temperature and white blood cell count, and to consider additional tests such as sputum cultures, pleural fluid culture, and a consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

3. Mechanical MVR (Mechanical Mitral Valve Replacement): The patient underwent mechanical MVR, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed that the mechanical valve was functioning properly. This supports the need for anticoagulation therapy.

4. LUE Clot (Left Upper Extremity Clot): The patient has extensive clot formation in the left upper extremity, which is likely related to subclavian line placement. The patient will require anticoagulation therapy for at least 3 months.

5. Pneumothorax: The patient developed a pneumothorax, which was identified on a chest X-ray."

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with mech MVR, PMH of DM, HOCM, CHF, Afib and recent
   intraventricular hemorrhage found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in PEA
   arrest, now intubated and unresponsive.
   # Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: Thought most likely hypoxic
   brain injury in setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and GI bleed,
   however MRI without evidence of ischemia.  Also in differential is
   status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode,
   medication effect. Last dose of sedation was on [**5-14**] when she received
   fentanyl bolus for MRI. MRI showed chronic overshunting however this
   not likely to be contributing to current presentation. Dilantin level
   is slightly sub therapeutic. Given low grade fevers with bacteremia and
   VP shunt, shunt was tapped to r/o CNS infection and showed no e/o
   infection.  Family meeting yesterday to discuss goals of care, no
   change in plan of care at this time.
   - neuro consult appreciated, follow up neuro recs
   - continue phenytoin to maintain level 15-20, slightly low this am
   adjusted for albumin; will adjust per neuro
   - continue to communicate with family re:goals of care
   .
   # UGIB: HCT stable. EGD + for clot that could not be removed. Repeat
   EGD showed residual organizing clot. Cont supportive care per GI. No
   further episodes of melena/hematemesis since [**5-13**]. Hct has remained
   stable. High risk to rebleed given appearance of clot in fundus and
   initiation of anti-coagulation

   # LUE clot:  Extensive clot likely related to subclavian line
   placement. Also had iliac
 femoral clot on CT thorax. Subclavian line
   still in place. Pt will require anticoagulation for at least 3 months.
   - cont anticoagulation with heparin gtt
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Identified on chest X-ray on [**5-16**] likely secondary to
   subclavian line placement on [**5-12**]. Thoracic surgery was consulted and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage. She was found unresponsive and hypoglycemic in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, now intubated and unresponsive. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status/unresponsiveness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), fever/leukocytosis, mechanical MVR, left upper extremity (LUE) clot, pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, bacteremia, hypothyroidism, and recent intraventricular hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/unresponsiveness: This could be due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of PEA arrest from hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, status epilepticus, prolonged effect from hypoglycemic episode, medication effect, or other underlying causes.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of recent UGIB, and there is a high risk of rebleeding given the appearance of a clot in the fundus. Monitoring for signs of active bleeding and transfusion for hematocrit (Hct) <30 are recommended.
3. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient has had a fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an infectious source. Further investigation is needed, including sputum, pleural fluid culture, and consideration of an infectious disease consult.
4. Mechanical MVR: The patient underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement. Anticoagulation is necessary due to the mechanical valve, and heparin has already been initiated.
5. Left upper extremity (LUE) clot: There is an extensive clot likely related to subclavian line placement. The patient requires anticoagulation for at least three months.
6. Pneumothorax: A pneumothorax was identified on chest X-ray and is likely secondary to subclavian line placement. Thoracic surgery placed a pigtail catheter, and daily chest X-rays should be monitored.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been poorly controlled, and insulin therapy has been adjusted to maintain better glycemic control.
8. Bacteremia: The patient had bacteremia with gram-positive cocci in four of four bottles from [5-11] and MRSE. Vancomycin therapy was initiated and will be continued for a 14-day course or possibly longer.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated TSH levels and slightly low free T4 levels, indicating hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine therapy has been started.
10. Additional access: The left subclavian line should be discontinued if additional access is able to be obtained, and the right internal jugular (IJ) line has already been placed.

Please note that the patient's medical conditions and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for further evaluation and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with previous intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia leading to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and fever of unclear etiology.

Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, which confers a dismal prognosis. EEG is not highly suggestive of status epilepticus but may be masked by global slowing. Dilantin level is therapeutic, and there is no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection by sampling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the VP shunt. Radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting is unlikely to be contributing to the present mental status.
2. UGIB: The patient had a significant upper gastrointestinal bleed that required transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She is at high risk for rebleeding based on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings, especially in the setting of systemic anticoagulation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, prolonged unresponsiveness with profound encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and fever of unclear etiology.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 115/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including encephalopathy likely due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, left pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, hypothyroidism, and DVTs in the left upper and right lower extremities.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments, including intravenous heparin, pantoprazole (Protonix), dilantin, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5621**], have reviewed the history with the housestaff and
   patient
s family, and concur with the physical examination noted
   above.  I agree with the assessment and treatment plan as outline
   above.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 5763**] is an 82 year old women who presented an anoxic
   encephalopathy along with a number of co-morbidities listed above.  I
   have discussed her current condition and our plan with the family at
   her bedside.  Our plan involves continued treatment of her
   encephalopathy and institution of anticoagulation for her systemic
   thromboses.  We will also remove her left subclavian line due to its
   potential source for infection and clot.  We will make movements to
   transition her toward chronic care and assess the need for the
   placement of a tracheostomy.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt complicated by intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, prolonged unresponsiveness with severe encephalopathy, left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and fever of unclear etiology.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, anticoagulation therapy, and continuous heparin infusion. She has received blood products, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains unresponsive with decerebrate posturing. Her neurological status has not improved since the event, indicating a poor prognosis. EEG results are inconclusive for status epilepticus, and there is no evidence of central nervous system infection. The VP shunt is unlikely to be contributing to her mental status.

The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Her electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient's plan includes weekly phenytoin levels to maintain therapeutic levels, communication with the family regarding goals of care, and monitoring for signs of active bleeding. The patient's anticoagulation will continue, and she will be transfused to maintain a hemoglobin level above 27. Daily hemoglobin monitoring will be done,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including mechanical mitral valve (MVR), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for chronic hydrocephalus, recent MRSE bacteremia, and previous myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was found unresponsive with profound encephalopathy and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She now shows signs of severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and fever of unclear etiology.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium infusion, dilantin, pantoprazole, and protonix. She has received antibiotics such as ceftriaxone and vancomycin in the past. Her recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, low albumin level, and abnormal liver function tests.

The assessment and plan include several sections:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's severe encephalopathy is attributed to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement. The electroencephalogram (EEG) does not suggest status epilepticus, and there is no evidence of central nervous system infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with history of intraventricular hemorrhage, recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, profound encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and fever of unclear etiology. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest after being found unresponsive with profound encephalopathy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Encephalopathy - The patient has severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, which confers a dismal prognosis. EEG results are not highly suggestive of status epilepticus but may be masked by global slowing. Dilantin level is therapeutic, and there is no evidence of CNS infection by sampling of CSF from VP shunt. Radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting is unlikely to be contributing to the present mental status.
   - Appreciate neuro recs.
   - Continue phenytoin to maintain level 15-20.
   - Continue to communicate with family re: goals of care.

2. UGIB - The patient had an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-inch tall male weighing 79 kg.
- He underwent valve replacement surgery, specifically mitral mechanical valve replacement (MVR).
- The patient is experiencing fever, altered mental status, and an alteration in nutrition.
- There is a history of hospital-acquired infection, barotrauma, ineffective coping, hyperglycemia, anoxic brain damage, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac arrest.
- The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids at a rate of 62.5 mL/hour.
- There are multiple lines inserted, including a multi-lumen line.
- Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all measures should be taken to resuscitate him in case of cardiac arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Poor nutritional status: The alteration in nutrition and impaired skin integrity suggest that the patient may not be receiving adequate nutrition, which can further impact his overall health and recovery.
3. Hyperglycemia: The high glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia, which can increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing.

   # Encephalopthy
 hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest
   without subsequent neurological improvement confer dismal prognosis;
   EEG not highly suggestive of status epilepticus but may be masked by
   global slowing; dilantin level therapeutic; no evidence of CNS
   infection by sampling of CSF from VP shunt; radiographic evidence of
   chronic overshunting unlikely to be contributing to present mental
   status

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to intraventricular hemorrhage, recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, prolonged unresponsive state with severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and fever of unclear etiology. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. She has a history of hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological improvement, which confers a dismal prognosis. There is no evidence of central nervous system infection, and radiographic evidence shows chronic overshunting unlikely to be contributing to the present mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological improvement. This condition can lead to further cognitive decline and potentially death.
2. UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding): The patient has a high risk for rebleeding based on endoscopic findings. Active bleeding may require additional transfusions and close monitoring for symptoms of active bleeding.
3. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): The patient has extensive clot involvement in the left upper extremity at the site of subclavian central"

   and our plan with the family at her bedside.  Our plan involves
   continued treatment of her encephalopathy and institution of
   anticoagulation for her systemic thromboses.   We will arrange for a
   tracheostomy and potential G-tube placement as per the family
   requests.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with history of intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, profound encephalopathy, left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was found unresponsive with severe encephalopathy. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, which confers a dismal prognosis. There is no evidence of CNS infection, and the EEG does not suggest status epilepticus but may be masked by global slowing. The patient is on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, and weekly levels will be monitored to maintain levels between 15-20 mcg/mL.

2. UGIB: The patient has a history of UGIB, and high-risk factors for rebleeding are present, especially with systemic anticoagulation. She has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and requires transfusion to maintain hemoglobin concentration (Hct) >27%. Daily H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who underwent a mitral valve replacement surgery. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various health issues.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.8 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/53 to 123/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His weight is currently 79 kg, and he is 64 inches tall.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) levels, and normal platelet (Plt) levels. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 68 mg/dL to 198 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal kidney function (creatinine/Cr), and altered electrolyte levels (Na+/K+).

The patient's physical examination reveals non-pitting edema in the upper extremities, a holosystolic murmur at the apex, and cool skin. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive with decerebrate posturing.

The patient's medical history includes valve replacement surgery, fever, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, ineffective coping, hyperglycemia, anoxic brain damage, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest a possible infection.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and decerebrate posturing indicate a potential delirium.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory rate and ABG results suggest possible respiratory problems.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet levels are slightly low, which may indicate thrombocytopenia.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's fluctuating blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia.
7. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest possible renal dysfunction.
8. Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes suggest possible liver dysfunction.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The altered electrolyte levels may cause various complications.
10. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's cool skin and edema may lead to impaired skin integrity.

These potential complications need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing severe encephalopathy, which could be due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement. This condition has a dismal prognosis.

2. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a high risk for rebleeding based on EGD findings in the setting of systemic anticoagulation. They have received a transfusion of 1U pRBC and require continued monitoring for signs of active bleeding.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has extensive clot involvement in the left upper extremity (LUE) at the site of the subclavian central venous line as well as the right iliac-femoral veins. Anticoagulation with heparin is being continued, and the subclavian line will be removed when additional access is obtained (R PICC).

4. Left Pneumothorax: The patient has a left pneumothorax, which is stable after pigtail catheter placement. However, follow-up with thoracics recommendations and monitoring of clinical status and chest X-ray is necessary.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars are well-controlled with the current regimen of Lantus 26U qAM, 36U insulin in TPN, and sliding scale"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), bladder cancer (CA), ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt with a history of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSE) bacteremia, pulmonary embolism arrest after being found unresponsive with severe encephalopathy, left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and fever of unclear etiology.

The patient's current condition is severe encephalopathy, and the neurologic insult is believed to be hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological improvement, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. The electroencephalogram (EEG) does not suggest status epilepticus, and there is no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection by sampling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the VP shunt. Radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting unlikely to be contributing to the present mental status.

The patient has had multiple interventions and ongoing management for various conditions. These include:
1. Encephalopathy: Weekly phenytoin levels, adjust dose to maintain level 15-20, continue to communicate with family re: goals"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt causing intraventricular hemorrhage, recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and previous myocardial infarction. She presented with profound encephalopathy, left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Assessment:
1. Severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, which confers a dismal prognosis.
2. Left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Hypothyroidism.
5. Hyperglycemia well-controlled with insulin therapy.
6. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
7. Chronic overshunting of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which may contribute to the current mental status.

Plan:
1. Continue with neurologic recommendations and arrange for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
2. Monitor phenytoin levels and adjust the dose to maintain a therapeutic level of 15-20.
3. Communicate with the family regarding goals of care.
4. Transfuse packed red blood cells to maintain hemoglobin concentration above 27.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt (c/b intraventricular hemorrhage), recent MRSE bacteremia, and profound encephalopathy.
- She presented with severe encephalopathy, left upper extremity/right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG) which did not suggest status epilepticus but may be masked by global slowing.
- There is no evidence of CNS infection by sampling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the VP shunt, and radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting unlikely to be contributing to the present mental status.
- The patient has been started on phenytoin therapy with weekly levels to maintain between 15-20.
- She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to UGIB and is at high risk for rebleeding based on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings.
- The patient is being transfused to maintain hematocrit (Hct) >27 and will have daily Hct checks.
- Active bleeding time and clotting time (T&C) are being monitored.
- Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been initiated"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including mechanical valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt for chronic subdural hematoma with intraventricular hemorrhage, recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and profound hypoglycemia resulting in a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has several ongoing medical concerns.

Potential medical complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy likely due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults during the PEA arrest. This condition may result in further neurological decline.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a high risk for rebleeding based on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings. She has already required a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and may require additional blood products if bleeding recurs.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has extensive clots involving the left upper extremity at the site of subclavian central venous line as well as the right iliac-femoral veins. She is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and will continue it after the removal of the subclavian line.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt with history of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSE) bacteremia, profound hypoglycemia, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest after being found unresponsive with profound hypoglycemia and now presents with severe encephalopathy. The patient's neurological status has not improved following the arrest, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) does not suggest status epilepticus. There is no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling from the VP shunt. Radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting is unlikely to be contributing to the patient's mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's severe encephalopathy is a result of hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults during the PEA arrest. The prognosis for neurological recovery is poor.
2. UGIB: The patient has a high risk for rebleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with past intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, profound hypoglycemia, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was found unresponsive with a PEA arrest and has been in a state of encephalopathy since then. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities and ongoing medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's severe encephalopathy may be due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults during the peri-arrest period without subsequent neurological improvement. This situation confers a dismal prognosis, and further neurological recommendations are appreciated.
2. UGIB: The patient had an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which required transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient is at high risk for rebleeding due to endoscopic findings and systemic anticoagulation. Transfusion will be maintained to keep the hemoglobin concentration (Hct) above 27%, and a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned today to evaluate for residual clot.
3. DVT: The patient has extensive clot involvement"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of valve replacement (mitral mechanical valve replacement) admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 40%. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/37-55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient also has impaired skin integrity and a history of cardiac arrest. The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and has multiple lines including a PICC line. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and early identification of symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and worsening oxygenation should be done.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for chronic hydrocephalus, and recent MRSE bacteremia. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest after being found unresponsive with profound encephalopathy. She is currently in the ICU with severe encephalopathy, left upper extremity (LUE) and right lower extremity (RLE) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy, which is likely due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement. This prognosis is not favorable.
2. UGIB: The patient has a high risk for rebleeding based on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings, especially in the setting of systemic anticoagulation. She received a transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBC) and will be monitored closely for signs of active bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia resulting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient had a PEA arrest after being found unresponsive with profound hypoglycemia, which led to severe encephalopathy. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was not highly suggestive of status epilepticus but may be masked by global slowing. Dilantin level was therapeutic, and there was no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection by sampling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the VP shunt. Radiographic evidence showed chronic overshunting unlikely to be contributing to the present mental status.

The patient has ongoing issues with fever, likely due to clot burden and endovascular infection in the setting of MRSE bacteremia. She also has a history of hyperglycemia, which is well-controlled with blood sugars in the range of 120-140 on her current regimen. She has hypothyroidism with an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 8 and slightly low free T4 (0.9). She was started on thyroid replacement on May 17th.

Other findings include extensive DVT involving the left upper extremity at the site of subclavian central venous line as well as the right iliac-femoral veins. The subclavian line was removed on May 23rd. The patient also had a left pneumothorax, which was stable and had a pigtail catheter removed on May 23rd. She requires further evaluation by a thoracic surgeon.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Her kidney function is normal with a creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL. Her liver function tests (LFT) are trending down, and her electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), dilantin, metoprolol, and other ICU medications. She is also receiving TPN with lipids and has a multi-lumen line and PICC line in place. She is on systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with IV PPI. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU for long-term placement planning after tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with subsequent intraventricular hemorrhage, and recent MRSE bacteremia. She presented with profound hypoglycemia and was found unresponsive, leading to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She has since experienced severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's global slowing EEG suggests hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological improvement, indicating a poor prognosis. Dilantin levels are therapeutic, and there is no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection from VP shunt sampling. Radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting is unlikely to be contributing to the present mental status.

2. UGIB: The patient has had one unit of packed red blood cells transfused with stable hematocrit. She is at high risk for rebleeding due to EGD findings in the setting of systemic anticoagulation. She required a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells on [5-18], and her Hct has remained stable since then. No melena or hematemesis is noted.

3. Fever: The patient continues to have low"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including mechanical mitral valve (MVR), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt causing intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSE) bacteremia leading to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient's recent history includes profound hypoglycemia, unresponsiveness, and a PEA arrest following MRSE bacteremia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe encephalopathy. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/37-134/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's global slowing on EEG suggests hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological improvement, indicating a poor prognosis. No evidence of central nervous system infection is observed, and radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with history of intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia leading to pulseless electrical activity arrest, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, left pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient underwent an endoscopy which showed small gastric arteriovenous malformation and antral polyps. The patient also had a tracheostomy, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding): The patient has a history of UGIB, and although the EGD showed resolution of clot in the antrum, there is still a risk of re-bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding such as melena or hematemesis is important.

2. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): The patient has extensive clot involving the left upper extremity at the site of subclavian central venous line as well as the right iliac-femoral veins. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin is necessary to prevent further clot formation and to reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism.

3. Hypoglycemia:"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with history of intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia leading to pulseless electrical activity arrest, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an endoscopy which revealed a small gastric arteriovenous malformation, antral polyps, and no clot. An intraoperative consultation determined that an esophagogastrojejunostomy (G-J) tube could not be placed due to the presence of a left hepatic lobe and bowel. The patient subsequently had a tracheostomy, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy placed. The patient's allergies include lorazepam, confusion/delirium, and she has a history of vancomycin use. The patient is currently receiving various medications including midazolam, pantoprazole, dilantin, heparin sodium, fentanyl, and metoprolol. 

Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing severe encephalopathy, likely due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological improvement. The prognosis is considered dismal, and the EEG does not suggest status epilepticus.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, previous pulseless electrical activity arrest, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, hypothyroidism, and multiple other comorbidities. She has been unresponsive since being found with profound hypoglycemia and has experienced multiple hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological improvement, resulting in a dismal prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy, which may worsen due to the previous hypoxic/hypoglycemic insults and lack of neurological improvement. This could lead to further decline in mental status or even brain death.
2. UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding): Although the patient underwent an EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy) that showed resolution of clot in the antrum, she still requires monitoring for any signs of re-bleeding. Given her need for systemic anticoagulation, there is a risk of further bleeding episodes.
3. Fever: The patient continues to have low-grade temperatures, likely due to [**2-21"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mrs. [Last Name] is an 82-year-old woman who presented with an anoxic event. She has undergone successful G-tube and J-tube placement, as well as a tracheostomy. She has a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with previous intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, profound hypoglycemia, severe encephalopathy, left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults. This condition can lead to persistent neurological impairment, which may affect her ability to respond and interact with the environment.

2. UGIB: The patient has a history of UGIB, which may recur if not managed appropriately. This could result in further bleeding and potential complications such as anemia or shock.

3. DVT: The patient has extensive DVT involving the left upper extremity at the site of subclavian central venous line, as well as the right iliac-femoral veins. If left untreated, this could lead to pulmonary embolism.

4. Hyperglycemia: Although the patient's blood sugars are currently well-controlled, there"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, and multiple comorbidities. She presented with profound hypoglycemia and encephalopathy, which resulted in a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and intubated but has not shown neurological improvement. She also has left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), fever, and a pneumothorax. She requires ongoing management for multiple medical complications including encephalopathy, UGIB, fever, DVT, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia. She is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a tracheostomy, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient continues to show no neurological improvement despite resuscitation efforts. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential for seizures given the presence of epileptiform waveforms on EEG.
2. UGIB: Although an endoscopy showed resolution of clot in the antrum, there is still a risk of recurrent bleeding due to the patient's need for systemic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt for chronic hydrocephalus with recent meningitis and bacteremia due to MRSE, and previous myocardial infarction. She was found unresponsive with profound hypoglycemia and subsequently had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU for severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and left pneumothorax. The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, anti-seizure medication, and thyroid replacement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy likely due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement. This can lead to prolonged confusion, altered mental status, and potential for further neurological deterioration.
2. UGIB: The patient has a history of UGIB, which may recur due to the presence of antral polyps and a possible small gastric arteriovenous malformation (AVM). This could result in significant bleeding and require urgent endoscopic intervention or blood transfusion.
3. DVT: The patient has extensive DVT involving"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, and previous myocardial infarction. She presented to the hospital unresponsive with profound hypoglycemia and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She has been diagnosed with severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's severe encephalopathy is attributed to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement. An electroencephalogram (EEG) does not suggest status epilepticus, and there is no evidence of central nervous system infection by sampling of cerebrospinal fluid from the ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting is unlikely to be contributing to her mental status.

2. UGIB: The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed a high risk for rebleeding in the setting of systemic anticoagulation. She required transfusion of one unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on May 18th, and her hemoglobin concentration has"

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSE) bacteremia, profound hypoglycemia, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient has had multiple interventions including endoscopy, tracheostomy, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy tube placements. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 112/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), but normal electrolyte levels. The patient's glucose levels are well-controlled, and her phenytoin level is slightly low but expected to be corrected after a bolus administration.

The patient's medical complications include fever, mechanical valve requiring anticoagulation, extensive DVT involving the left upper extremity and right iliac/femoral veins, left pneumothorax (resolved), hyperglycemia, hypothyroidism, and potential stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's current plan includes restarting heparin gtt for anticoagulation, continuing thyroid replacement, maintaining Hct >27, daily Hct, active type and crossmatch, and starting coumadin tomorrow after 24 hours on heparin. The patient also requires nutrition support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), repletion of electrolytes as needed, and once bowel sounds are present, tube feeding (TF) can be initiated.

The patient's access for medication administration is through the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and right peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) for now, with a case manager screening.

The patient's contact information includes her daughter, husband, healthcare provider, and telephone/fax numbers."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with history of intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSA bacteremia leading to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient's recent history includes being found unresponsive with profound hypoglycemia and subsequently experiencing a PEA arrest. She has severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, as per EEG results. There is no evidence of CNS infection from sampling of cerebrospinal fluid from the VP shunt, and radiographic evidence of chronic overshunting is unlikely to contribute to the present mental status.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including endoscopy, tracheostomy, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy tube placement. She has been receiving various medications, including midazolam, pantoprazole, dilantin, heparin sodium, fentanyl, metoprolol, and phenytoin.

Potential Medical Complications:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, and previous myocardial infarction. The patient presented with profound hypoglycemia and unresponsiveness, leading to pulseless electrical activity arrest. She was resuscitated but developed severe encephalopathy. She also has left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper gastrointestinal bleeding, fever, left pneumothorax, hyperglycemia, hypothyroidism, and edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults. The prognosis is dismal, and there is no evidence of CNS infection. The EEG suggests global slowing, but dilantin levels are therapeutic. Phenytoin levels are slightly low, and a discussion with neurology is needed to adjust the dose and switch to keppra.
2. UGIB: The patient had upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which was resolved with endoscopy. She received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells and will be maintained with a hematocrit level above 27%. Daily monitoring of hematocrit, an active tissue compatibility cross-match, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to previous intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia, and past medical history of pulseless electrical activity arrest after being found unresponsive with profound hypoglycemia. She is currently in the ICU due to severe encephalopathy, left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's severe encephalopathy is a result of hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement. This prognosis is dismal, and further neurologic recommendations are needed.

2. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has ongoing risk for rebleeding due to systemic anticoagulation. She received a transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells and requires continued monitoring of hemoglobin concentration. Daily Hct and active type and crossmatch are also recommended.

3. Fever: The patient continues to have low-grade temperatures, likely due to clot burden and endovascular infection in the setting of MRSE bacteremia. A repeat endoscopic examination today will evaluate for residual clot. Vancomycin will be continued for 6 weeks, and the patient's white blood cell count and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including mechanical mitral valve (MVR), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt with history of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) bacteremia, profound hypoglycemia, severe encephalopathy, left upper extremity and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient's current assessment includes encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological improvement, which has a dismal prognosis. The patient is on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, with a goal level of 15-20 mcg/mL after correcting for albumin. Phenytoin level is slightly low today, and it will be discussed with neurology to get appropriate dose adjustment.

The patient also has ongoing UGIB, which was resolved with an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) yesterday. She required a transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (pRBC) on 5/18, and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has remained stable since then. There is no melena or hematemesis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with intraventricular hemorrhage, recent MRSE bacteremia leading to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She has been unresponsive since the arrest and has not shown neurological improvement. The patient's prognosis is poor due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults without subsequent neurological recovery. She continues to be on seizure prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's severe encephalopathy indicates ongoing brain dysfunction. This could potentially progress to multiorgan failure if not managed appropriately.
2. DVT: The presence of extensive clots in the left upper extremity and right iliac/femoral veins indicates a high risk for further thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy is ongoing to prevent clot propagation and new clot formation.
3. UGIB: Although the endoscopic examination showed resolution of clot in the antrum, there is still a risk of recurrent bleeding due to the underlying conditions and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Infection: The patient had a previous MRSE bacteremia and current fever with trending down white blood cell count suggests"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including mechanical mitral valve, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt complicated by intraventricular hemorrhage, recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, profound hypoglycemia, severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current assessment includes severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, which indicates a dismal prognosis. She is on seizure prophylaxis with keppra and phenytoin taper.

Regarding the upper gastrointestinal bleeding, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed yesterday, revealing resolution of the clot in the antrum. The patient required a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) on [5-18], and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has remained stable since then. No melena or hematemesis is noted. The plan is to maintain Hct >27%, perform daily Hct checks, and keep an active blood type and crossmatch. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been initiated.

The patient also has a fever of 101 degrees overnight. Her white blood cell count (WBC) is"

The patient's current condition includes:
- Severe encephalopathy due to hypoxic/hypoglycemic cerebral insults peri-arrest without subsequent neurological improvement, which is associated with a dismal prognosis.
- Left upper extremity and right lower extremity DVT.
- UGIB, for which an endoscopic examination of the digestive tract (EGD) was performed yesterday, revealing resolution of clot in the antrum. The patient received a blood transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (pRBC) on [5-18]. No melena or hematemesis has been observed since then.
- Fever to 101 degrees overnight, with a declining white blood cell (WBC) count. Fever is likely due to clot burden"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), bladder cancer, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSE) bacteremia, and previous pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to profound hypoglycemia. The patient is currently experiencing severe encephalopathy, left upper and right lower deep vein thrombosis (DVT), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), fever, and a pneumothorax in the left lung.

The patient has been managed with multiple interventions, including antibiotic therapy for MRSE bacteremia, anticoagulation for DVT and mechanical valve prophylaxis, transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The patient's blood glucose levels have been well-controlled, and thyroid replacement therapy has been initiated due to elevated TSH levels.

The patient's current goals of care include aggressive management and continuation of full code status. The plan is to continue with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), repletion of electrolytes as needed, and initiation of tube feeds once bowel sounds are present. Diuresis with a goal of 1 liter negative fluid balance is also planned.
