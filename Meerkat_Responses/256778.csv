   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo man with metastatic renal cell CA s/p allo- SCT with subsequent
   severe chronic resp failure thought to be emphysema and fibrosis and
   possible GVHD/BOOP (CT from last spring demonstrates severe cystic and
   fibrotic changes with almost no normal appearing lung) presented with 2
   wk prodrome, now with catastrophic acute on chronic failure. CXR shows
   diffuse opacification. Severe septic shock, now on 2 pressors. Not
   recently on corticosteroids.
   SEPTIC SHOCK
   Most likely source pneumonia. R/O for influenza at OSH.
   Vanc/Zosyn/Levoflox/Bactrim/Caspofungin/acyclovir prophylaxis.
   Cx pending.
   Markers pending.
   Not safe for bronch.
   RESP FAILURE
   Infection, sepsis, acute exacerbation of underlying chronic disease as
   well as cardiac component with likely severe PH and also likely
   impaired LV filling and impaired LV outflow with subsequent CHF.
   - oxygenation currently adequate on high PEEP, max FiO2
   - consider paralysis if we are unable to decrease FiO2
   - rescue strategy may include inhaled prostacyclin or NO, though he may
   have severe F/Q mismatch/shunt given his underlying severe lung
   disease.
   HYPOTENSION
   Septic shock. Has one adrenal gland with metastatic lesion.
   Fluid resuscitation. Received high dose steroids at OSH. Add high dose
   hydrocortisone.
   CARDIAC
   Severe PH. New TW inversions, likely demand ischemia with tachy,
   hypotension.
   TTE.
   Aspirin.
   SEDATION with fent 350 /versed 6

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and DLI. He also has a history of emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. The patient presented with sepsis and acute respiratory failure. He was intubated and started on NIPPV, hydrocortisone, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Despite aggressive management, the patient remains critically ill with severe respiratory failure, hypotension, and signs of septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe chronic respiratory failure due to emphysema and fibrosis, which has worsened with acute exacerbation. The diffuse opacification seen on CXR indicates pneumonia as a likely source of infection. Inadequate oxygenation and ventilation can lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already in septic shock, and there is a risk of progressing to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not appropriately managed.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised due to severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) and impaired LV filling and outflow. This can result in decreased cardiac output and subsequent hypotension.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is primarily due to septic shock. However, his single adrenal gland with metastatic lesion raises"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo man with metastatic renal cell CA s/p allo- SCT with subsequent
   severe chronic resp failure thought to be emphysema and fibrosis and
   possible GVHD/BOOP (CT from last spring demonstrates severe cystic and
   fibrotic changes with almost no normal appearing lung) presented with 2
   wk prodrome, now with catastrophic acute on chronic failure. CXR shows
   diffuse opacification. Severe septic shock, now on 2 pressors. Not
   recently on corticosteroids.
   SEPTIC SHOCK
   Most likely source pneumonia. R/O for influenza at OSH.
   Vanc/Zosyn/Levoflox/Bactrim/Caspofungin/acyclovir prophylaxis.
   Cx pending.
   Markers pending.
   Not safe for bronch.
   RESP FAILURE
   Infection, sepsis, acute exacerbation of underlying chronic disease as
   well as cardiac component with likely severe PH and also likely
   impaired LV filling and impaired LV outflow with subsequent CHF.
   - oxygenation currently adequate on high PEEP, max FiO2
   - consider paralysis if we are unable to decrease FiO2
   - rescue strategy may include inhaled prostacyclin or NO, though he may
   have severe F/Q mismatch/shunt given his underlying severe lung
   disease.
   HYPOTENSION
   Septic shock. Has one adrenal gland with metastatic lesion.
   Fluid resuscitation. Received high dose steroids at OSH. Add high dose
   hydrocortisone.
   CARDIAC
   Severe PH. New TW inversions, likely demand ischemia with tachy,
   hypotension.
   TTE.
   Aspirin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. He presents with severe chronic respiratory failure, which is believed to be due to emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and possible graft-versus-host disease/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). He also has a history of severe cystic and fibrotic changes in the lungs, as seen on a CT scan from last spring. The patient was admitted with a 2-week prodrome and now has catastrophic acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. A chest X-ray shows diffuse opacification.

The patient is currently experiencing severe septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia. He requires two pressors (norepinephrine and vasopressin) for blood pressure support. He is not currently on corticosteroids. Cultures have been obtained, and various prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals are being administered.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to infection, sepsis, acute exacerbation of underlying chronic disease, cardiac component with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), impaired left ventricular filling, and impaired left ventricular outflow with subsequent congestive heart failure (CHF). Oxygenation is currently adequate on high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), but there may be a need for paralysis if FiO2 cannot be decreased. Inhaled prostacy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU for esophageal balloon placement. The patient has been paralyzed to improve ventilation, and a family meeting was held to discuss the gravity of the situation. The patient's DNR status was discussed, but they remain full code. The patient is weaned off levophed and remains on vasopressin. A Vigileo device has been applied for CO monitoring, and the patient's EF is greater than 55%. There is mild LV diastolic dysfunction, RV with mild global free wall hypokinesis, and moderate to severe RV pressure overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of vasopressor medications increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current renal function is compromised, and further deterioration could lead to AKI.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is currently normal, but prolonged ICU stay and electrolyte imbalances may predispose the patient to arrhythmias.
6. Sepsis: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, indicating a potential infection that needs to be"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02 presents
   with sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely pneumonia given new opacities on CXR, although
   difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
   symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH. Urine, GI sources less probable.
   Given immunocompromise from malignancy, at risk for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], etc.
   Progression of GVHD could be contributing.
   - IVF resuscitation for MAP>65, IVF aggressively then pressors if
   necessary
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim, caspofungin to cover broadly for
   now given critical illness
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Legionella antigen, glucan, galactomannan
   - CT chest and possible bronch when more stable
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve
   - PPD to be read [**4-17**]
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, GVHD, fibrosis. Avoid high pressures given fibrotic
   lungs, will attempt pressure control to limit.
   - Continue mechanical ventilatory support, wean as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Primary respiratory, non-gap, lactate normal. Increase
   minute ventilation. [**Month (only) 60**] require paralysis for adequate ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Likely sepsis, although probably component of
   hypovolemia as well. At risk for PE given malignancy. GI bleed unlikely
   as Hct stable. Adrenal insufficiency possible.
   - Treat broadly per above
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim in AM, after high dose steroids from OSH are off.
   - LENIs for ? DVT.  Don't want to empirically start heparin given RCC
   and risk to bleed.
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - Continue to trend enzymes and treat underlying cause
   - ASA, hold on beta-blocker and statin
   - TTE to eval for wall motion abnormality
   - Repeat ECG in am
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Avoid steroids given risk to graft
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presents with sepsis and has underlying emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently on mechanical ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. He also has hypotension, acidosis, and possible cardiac ischemia. The patient's cancer is recurrent despite previous treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with sepsis, likely due to pneumonia. It is important to treat the infection aggressively with broad-spectrum antibiotics and identify the source of infection through cultures and imaging studies.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia and his underlying lung conditions such as emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanical ventilatory support is necessary, and pressure control should be attempted to limit lung injury.

3. Acidosis: The patient has primary respiratory acidosis, and minute ventilation should be increased to correct it. Paralysis may be required for adequate ventilation.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis and hypovolemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered, and fluid resuscitation should be aggressive. The possibility of pulmonary embolism should also be considered, and a lower extrem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplantation, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He is also suffering from emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. The patient presents with sepsis and respiratory failure due to likely pneumonia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has hypotension, hypoxia, fever, and leukocytosis, indicating systemic infection. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with decreased ejection fraction and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction. The patient also has adrenal insufficiency, which may be contributing to his hypotension. There are concerns about potential pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is presenting with signs of systemic infection, including fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and hypoxia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential pathogens, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Further diagnostic tests, such as bronchoscopy and cultures, are needed to identify the causative organism.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, considering the hypoxia and possible opacities on chest X-ray. High levels"

   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02 presents
   with sepsis.
   # Sepsis: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic with fevers
   and leukocytosis. Now with hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring
   pressors.  Likely pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on
   CXR, although difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent
   localizing symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH. Urine, GI sources less
   probable. Given immunocompromise from malignancy, at risk for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], etc. Progression of GVHD could be contributing. Given tenuous
   respiratory status and requirments for high levels of PEEP a
   bronchoscopy would  be too high risk for BAL and culture data.
   - Will attempt to obtain deep ET sputum for culture
   - legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly for now given critical illness.  Iv steroids for PCP and
   adrenal insufficiency as below.
   - glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - CT chest and possible bronch when more stable
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve
   - PPD to be read [**4-17**]
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis. Avoid high pressures given fibrotic
   lungs, using pressure control ventilation.  Tolerated decrease in Fi02
   from 100% to 60% yesterday, oxygenating well.
   -continue to wean FI02
   -will d/c cisatracurium infusion and use boluses as needed for
   paralysis should pt be dysynchronous with ventilator, otherwise will
   continue to manage sedation/pain with fentanyl/versed, increasing gtt
   as needed.
   - Continue mechanical ventilatory support, wean as tolerated
   -No proning for now as pt oxygenating well.
   # Hypotension: Likely sepsis, although probably component of
   hypovolemia as well. At risk for PE given malignancy. GI bleed unlikely
   as Hct stable. Adrenal insufficiency possible given s/p adrenelectomy
   with mets in remaining adrenal.  Pt has dysfunctional RV with severe
   [**Last Name (un) 469**] likely contributing to low CO.  Set up vigileo device yesterday
   for non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring.  Initially CI was 2.8, this am
   1.8, a concerning decrease.  His SV variability is low, indicating
   minimal fluid responsiveness.
   - start dobutamine in an attempt to increase CO, titrate to goal CO >4,
   CI >2.5, maintain on vasopressin and levophed.  Monitor pressors if
   becomes hypotensive due to vasodilitory effect will discontinue.
   - No prostacyclin/NO for now due to concern that may increase mismatch
   and worsen hypoxia.
   - Consider PA catheter placement for more accurate hemodynamic
   monitoring, will continue to use vigileo for now.
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for  adrenal insufficiency
   - LENIs to look for DVT negative.
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s this am trending down
   - ASA, hold on beta-blocker and statin
   - Repeat ECG in am
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone a nephrectomy, IL-2 treatment, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presents with sepsis and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has a history of emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen. His current condition includes hypoxia, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. The source of infection is suspected to be pneumonia given his hypoxia and possible opacities on the chest X-ray. Other sources have been ruled out.

2. Respiratory Failure: Due to his poor pulmonary reserve, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure. Pneumonia in the setting of emphysema, GVHD, and pulmonary fibrosis can lead to significant respiratory distress. 

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely due to sepsis and possibly hypovolemia as well. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) given"

   Progression of GVHD could be contributing.
   - Will attempt to obtain deep ET sputum for culture
   - legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly for now given critical illness.  Iv steroids for PCP and
   adrenal insufficiency as below.
   - glucan, galactomannan  pending for ? PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2263**]
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Unclear benefit of bronch for BAL at this point given duration of
   antimicrobial treatment and pt
s tenuous respiratory status, albeit
   improved from yesterday.
   - CT chest and possible bronch when more stable
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C today, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   -Switch back to pressure control for now, titrating down PEEP and Fi02
   as tolerated, attempt to wean sedation as much as possible.
   -Off cisatracurium since yesterday am.  Currently sedated on midazolam
   and fentanyl.
   # Hypotension: Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
s presentation of
   acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with hypotension made a
   septic shock picture predominate, however after adequate fluid
   rescusitation pt continued to require 2 pressors.  His TTE and vigileo
   monitoring were consistent with  low cardiac output due to pt
s severe
   pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary fibrosis and subsequent RV
   hypokinesis with resultant LVOT, a non-fluid responsive state.
   Dobutamin challenge yesterday resulted in increased CO to normal range
   with ability to be weaned off both levophed and vasopressin. UOP
   remains high at ~200cc/hour.
   - Continue dobutamine
   - No prostacyclin/NO for now due to concern that may increase mismatch
   and worsen hypoxia.
   - Continue HD monitoring with Vigileo device
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for  adrenal insufficiency, continue
   - Initially concerned for PE, however have more likley explanations for
   hypotension as listed above, LENIs negative
   - Start ACE low dose/short acting for afterload reduction.
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s trending down,  have stopped following.
   - ASA
   - ACEI as above for afterload reduction
   - Consider diuresis if UOP tapers off to further decrease preload.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presents with sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has evidence of pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, and is at risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) due to immunosuppression from malignancy and GVHD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, fibrosis, and possible GVHD puts him at risk for continued respiratory failure. 
2. Sepsis: The patient is already in septic shock, and there is a concern for ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
3. Pneumonia: Given the hypoxia and possible opacities on chest X-ray, pneumonia is likely. Legionella, urine, and blood cultures are pending.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient may have cardiac dysfunction due to severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypokinesis. Low cardiac output and hypotension have been observed.
5. Metastatic Renal Cancer: Recurrent disease is evident, and the patient is receiving treatment for metastatic renal cancer.

His vital signs include a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL and elevated lactate levels at 1.7 mmol/L. Imaging studies reveal possible opacities on chest X-ray, although the interpretation is limited due to pulmonary fibrosis. The patient's condition is complicated by severe septic shock, respiratory failure, hypotension, and potential opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). He also has a history of emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis, which may contribute to his respiratory distress. The patient's family has been informed of his critical condition, and a code"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Severe septic shock: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic
   with fevers and leukocytosis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 54**] ICU was intubated due
   to hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotensive requiring pressors.
   Likely pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on CXR, although
   difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
   symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH. Urine, GI sources less probable.
   Given immunocompromise from malignancy, at risk for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], etc.
   Progression of GVHD could be contributing.
   - Will attempt to obtain deep ET sputum for culture
   - legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly for now given critical illness.  Iv steroids for PCP and
   adrenal insufficiency as below.
   - glucan, galactomannan  pending for ? PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2263**]
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Unclear benefit of bronch for BAL at this point given duration of
   antimicrobial treatment and pt
s tenuous respiratory status, albeit
   improved from yesterday.
   - CT chest and possible bronch when more stable
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C today, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   -Switch back to pressure control for now, titrating down PEEP and Fi02
   as tolerated, attempt to wean sedation as much as possible.
   -Off cisatracurium since yesterday am.  Currently sedated on midazolam
   and fentanyl
   # Hypotension: Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
s presentation of
   acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with hypotension made a
   septic shock picture predominate, however after adequate fluid
   rescusitation pt continue to require 2 pressors.  His TTE and vigileo
   monitoring were consistent with
   - start dobutamine in an attempt to increase CO, titrate to goal CO >4,
   CI >2.5, maintain on vasopressin and levophed.  Monitor pressors if
   becomes hypotensive due to vasodilitory effect will discontinue.
   - No prostacyclin/NO for now due to concern that may increase mismatch
   and worsen hypoxia.
   - Consider PA catheter placement for more accurate hemodynamic
   monitoring, will continue to use vigileo for now.
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for  adrenal insufficiency
   - LENIs to look for DVT negative.
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s this am trending down
   - ASA, hold on beta-blocker and statin
   - Repeat ECG in am
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Avoid steroids given risk to graft
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone a nephrectomy, IL-2 treatment, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presents with sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PEEP at 14 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and PCV mode. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on the ventilator. 

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.1, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 21 mEq/L. Imaging studies reveal possible opacities on chest X-ray, but further investigations are needed to confirm the presence of pneumonia. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's condition is complicated by severe septic shock, likely due to pneumonia. The attending physicians have initiated broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy to cover for potential pathogens, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Steroids have also been administered for suspected PCP and adrenal insufficiency.

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02 presents
   with sepsis.
   # Sepsis: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic with fevers
   and leukocytosis. Now with hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring
   pressors.  Likely pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on
   CXR, although difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent
   localizing symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH. Urine, GI sources less
   probable. Given immunocompromise from malignancy, at risk for PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], etc. Progression of GVHD could be contributing. Given tenuous
   respiratory status and requirments for high levels of PEEP a
   bronchoscopy would  be too high risk for BAL and culture data.
   - Will attempt to obtain deep ET sputum for culture
   - legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly for now given critical illness.  Iv steroids for PCP and
   adrenal insufficiency as below.
   - glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - CT chest and possible bronch when more stable
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve
   - PPD to be read [**4-17**]
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis. Avoid high pressures given fibrotic
   lungs, using pressure control ventilation.  Tolerated decrease in Fi02

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who underwent a nephrectomy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presents with sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and requires pressors. The patient is immunocompromised due to malignancy and has a risk of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). His respiratory status is tenuous, and he requires high levels of PEEP. A bronchoscopy is planned to obtain BAL and culture data. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover for PCP and other infections. 

The patient has respiratory failure due to pneumonia, possibly GVHD, emphysema, and fibrosis. Pressure control ventilation is being used to avoid high pressures in the fibrotic lungs. FiO2 is being weaned as tolerated, and mechanical ventilatory support will continue.

Hypotension is likely due to sepsis and hypovolemia. The patient has a history of adrenalectomy and metastases in the remaining adrenal gland, which may indicate adrenal insufficiency. Dobutamine has been started to increase cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI). Vasopressor support will be continued, and consideration for a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter placement for hemodynamic monitoring will be made.

The patient also has cardiac issues, including probable demand ischemia, and will undergo"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presents with sepsis, hypoxia, and respiratory failure. The patient has emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen. He requires mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications to maintain blood pressure. There are concerns about possible pneumonia, PCP infection, and progression of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a risk of further deterioration or progression of the infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening hypoxia and potential need for more aggressive respiratory support.
3. Pneumonia: Given the patient's poor pulmonary reserve and potential immunocompromised state, there is a risk of developing pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory failure.
4. PCP Infection: The patient is at high risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) due to his immunocompromised status. Early detection and treatment are crucial.
5. GVHD: There is a risk of progression of GVHD, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction and further compromise the patient's condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Sepsis: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic with fevers
   and leukocytosis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 54**] ICU was intubated due to hypoxic
   respiratory failure and hypotensive requiring pressors.  Likely
   pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on CXR, although
   difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
   symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH.  At this point, WBC and fever curve
   decreasing. Covered on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly given critical illness.  As patient was on bactrim prophylaxis
   for PCP as outpatient and not on steroids, risk for PCP very low;
   therefore, will dc high dose bactrim and restart ppx dose.
   - D/C [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   - Also on IV steroids for PCP and adrenal insufficiency, see below
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   - Back on pressure control for now, based on transpulmonary pressure
   (10 and -2), will titrate down FiO2 as tolerated today.   Can consider
   changing to PSV or SIMV with low set respiratory rate if tolerated.
   -Off cisatracurium since [**4-17**].  Currently sedated on midazolam and
   fentanyl on maximal doses.  Will try trial of methadone to help
   decrease versed/fentanyl doses today. Attempt wean as tolerated.
   # Cardiogenic shock: Patient found to have PAH and RV failure on ECHO.
   Started on dobutamine with improvement in CI as well as pressures.
   Also started on captopril for afterload reduction which enabled
   decrease in dobutamine with continued improvement in hemodynamics.
   - Wean dobutamine today
   - Continue to monitor UOP and CI. If UOP decreases, will consider lasix
   drip if patient becomes very positive
   # Hypotension: Improved. Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
   presentation of acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with
   hypotension made a septic shock picture predominate, however after
   adequate fluid rescusitation pt continued to require 2 pressors.  His
   TTE and vigileo monitoring were consistent with low cardiac output due
   to pt
s severe pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary fibrosis and
   subsequent RV hypokinesis, a non-fluid responsive state.  Dobutamine
   challenge resulted in increased CO to normal range with ability to be
   weaned off both levophed and vasopressin and addition of captopril
   which led to decreased afterload allowed decrease in dobutamine.  Also,
   initial concern for adrenal insufficiency as patient has one adrenal
   gland with a metastasis, though he does not clinically appear to be
   functionally adrenally insufficient at this point.  UOP remains high at
   ~100-200cc/hour.
   - Continue dobutamine
   - Continue HD monitoring with Vigileo device
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for adrenal insufficiency, will start wean today with
   50mg q12, and subsequent wean over next few days.
   - Initially concerned for PE, however have more likley explanations for
   hypotension as listed above, LENIs negative
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s trending down,  have stopped following.
   - ASA
   - ACEI as above for afterload reduction
   - Consider diuresis if UOP tapers off to further decrease preload.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: TF not at goal due to high residuals, will reduce fentanyl,
   colace/senna, consider lactulose/oral naloxone if ileus persists. TPN
   for now.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He also has emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. He was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and required pressors for hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, likely due to poor pulmonary reserve caused by emphysema, possible GVHD, and fibrosis. He tolerated a decrease in PEEP and FiO2 yesterday but was less sedated off pressors and pulling on the endotracheal tube. He is currently on pressure control mode with titration of FiO2 as tolerated.

The patient also has cardiogenic shock with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and right ventricular (RV) failure. He was started on dobutamine and captopril for afterload reduction, which improved his cardiac index (CI) and pressures. Dobutamine is being weaned today, and the patient's urine output (UOP) is being monitored. If UOP decreases, consideration will be given to a lasix drip.

Additionally, the patient has hypotension, initially thought to be septic shock, but further evaluation showed low cardiac output due to severe pulmonary hypertension caused by pulmonary fib"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone a nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant (SCT), and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). He presents with hypotension, fevers, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe septic shock, likely caused by pneumonia. He also has pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a concern for pneumonia and worsening pulmonary function due to underlying emphysema and fibrosis.
2. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with signs of septic shock, characterized by hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential bacterial infections.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has impaired kidney function (high urine output) and may require further evaluation and management.
4. Metastatic Renal Cancer: The patient has recurrent metastatic renal cancer and will require ongoing monitoring and treatment.
5. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD): The patient's history of mini-allograft SCT increases the risk of GVHD, which can affect various organs including the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.
6. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has received IV hydro"

   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Septic shock: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic with
   fevers and leukocytosis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 54**] ICU was intubated due to
   hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotensive requiring pressors.  Likely
   pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on CXR, although
   difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
   symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH.  At this point, WBC and fever curve
   decreasing. Covered on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly given critical illness.  As patient was on bactrim prophylaxis
   for PCP as outpatient and not on steroids, risk for PCP very low;
   therefore, will dc high dose bactrim and restart ppx dose.
   - D/C [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   - Also on IV steroids for PCP and adrenal insufficiency, see below
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   - Back on pressure control for now, based on transpulmonary pressure
   (10 and -2), will titrate down FiO2 as tolerated today.   Can consider
   changing to PSV or SIMV with low set respiratory rate if tolerated.
   -Off cisatracurium since [**4-17**].  Currently sedated on midazolam and
   fentanyl on maximal doses.  Will try trial of methadone to help
   decrease versed/fentanyl doses today. Attempt wean as tolerated. Can
   consider propofol in addition in order to lower doses of
   versed/fentanyl.
   # Cardiogenic shock: Patient found to have PAH and RV failure on ECHO.
   Started on dobutamine with improvement in CI as well as pressures.
   Also started on captopril for afterload reduction which enabled
   decrease in dobutamine with continued improvement in hemodynamics.
   - Wean dobutamine today
   - Continue to monitor UOP and CI. If UOP decreases, will consider lasix
   drip if patient becomes very positive
   # Hypotension: Improved. Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
   presentation of acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with
   hypotension made a septic shock picture predominate, however after
   adequate fluid rescusitation pt continued to require 2 pressors.  His
   TTE and vigileo monitoring were consistent with low cardiac output due
   to pt
s severe pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary fibrosis and
   subsequent RV hypokinesis, a non-fluid responsive state.  Dobutamine
   challenge resulted in increased CO to normal range with ability to be
   weaned off both levophed and vasopressin and addition of captopril
   which led to decreased afterload allowed decrease in dobutamine.  Also,
   initial concern for adrenal insufficiency as patient has one adrenal
   gland with a metastasis, though he does not clinically appear to be
   functionally adrenally insufficient at this point.  UOP remains high at
   ~100-200cc/hour.
   - Continue dobutamine
   - Continue HD monitoring with Vigileo device
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for adrenal insufficiency, will start wean today with
   50mg q12, and subsequent wean over next few days.
   - Initially concerned for PE, however have more likley explanations for
   hypotension as listed above, LENIs negative
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s trended down,  have stopped following.
   - ASA
   - ACEI as above for afterload reduction
   - Consider diuresis if UOP tapers off to further decrease preload.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presents with hypotension, fevers, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with SIMV mode, but was switched back to pressure control due to dysynchrony. His PEEP was increased to 12 from 10, FiO2 increased from 40% to 50%, and driving pressure increased from 13 to 16.

The patient has a history of emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen. He was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. His WBC count is elevated, indicating possible infection. Cultures have been negative so far.

The patient's cardiovascular status shows signs of septic shock, with low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance. He required two pressors to maintain blood pressure. He also has pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure, as indicated by an echocardiogram.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. His urine output is high at 100-200 cc/hour, and he is not receiving lasix.

Other medical issues include metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which is recurrent despite previous treatments. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Severe septic shock: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic
   with fevers and leukocytosis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 54**] ICU was intubated due
   to hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotensive requiring pressors.
   Likely pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on CXR, although
   difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
   symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH. Urine, GI sources less probable.
   Given immunocompromise from malignancy, at risk for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], etc.
   Progression of GVHD could be contributing.
   - Will attempt to obtain deep ET sputum for culture
   - legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly for now given critical illness.  Iv steroids for PCP and
   adrenal insufficiency as below.
   - glucan, galactomannan  pending for ? PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2263**]
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Unclear benefit of bronch for BAL at this point given duration of
   antimicrobial treatment and pt
s tenuous respiratory status, albeit
   improved from yesterday.
   - CT chest and possible bronch when more stable
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C today, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   -Switch back to pressure control for now, titrating down PEEP and Fi02
   as tolerated, attempt to wean sedation as much as possible.
   -Off cisatracurium since yesterday am.  Currently sedated on midazolam
   and fentanyl.
   # Hypotension: Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
s presentation of
   acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with hypotension made a
   septic shock picture predominate, however after adequate fluid
   rescusitation pt continued to require 2 pressors.  His TTE and vigileo
   monitoring were consistent with  low cardiac output due to pt
s severe
   pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary fibrosis and subsequent RV
   hypokinesis with resultant LVOT, a non-fluid responsive state.
   Dobutamin challenge yesterday resulted in increased CO to normal range
   with ability to be weaned off both levophed and vasopressin. UOP
   remains high at ~200cc/hour.
   - Continue dobutamine
   - No prostacyclin/NO for now due to concern that may increase mismatch
   and worsen hypoxia.
   - Continue HD monitoring with Vigileo device
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for  adrenal insufficiency, continue
   - Initially concerned for PE, however have more likley explanations for
   hypotension as listed above, LENIs negative
   - Start ACE low dose/short acting for afterload reduction.
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s trending down,  have stopped following.
   - ASA
   - ACEI as above for afterload reduction
   - Consider diuresis if UOP tapers off to further decrease preload.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: TF not at goal due to high residuals, will reduce fentanyl,
   colace/senna, consider lactulose/oral naloxone if ileus persists. TPN
   for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 treatment, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He also has emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen.
- The patient presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. He was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and required pressors for hypotension.
- The patient is suspected to have severe septic shock, likely caused by pneumonia given his hypoxia and possible opacities on the chest X-ray. Other sources of infection have been ruled out.
- The patient is at high risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) due to his immunocompromised state from malignancy and progression of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover for PCP and other potential infections.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved from yesterday, but he still requires mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's hypotension is likely a mixed picture of septic shock and low cardiac output due to severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypokinesis.
- Dobutamine has been started to improve cardiac output, and afterload reduction has been initiated.
- The patient's urinary output remains high at around 200 cc/hour.

   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C today, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   -Switch back to pressure control for now, titrating down PEEP and Fi02
   as tolerated, attempt to wean sedation as much as possible.
   -Off cisatracurium since yesterday am.  Currently sedated on midazolam
   and fentanyl.
   # Hypotension: Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
s presentation of
   acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with hypotension made a
   septic shock picture predominate, however after adequate fluid
   rescusitation pt continued to require 2 pressors.  His TTE and vigileo
   monitoring were consistent with  low cardiac output due to pt
s severe
   pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary fibrosis and subsequent RV
   hypokinesis with resultant LVOT, a non-fluid responsive state.
   Dobutamin challenge yesterday resulted in increased CO to normal range
   with ability to be weaned off both levophed and vasopressin. UOP
   remains high at ~200cc/hour.
   - Continue dobutamine
   - No prostacyclin/NO for now due to concern that may increase mismatch
   and worsen hypoxia.
   - Continue HD monitoring with Vigileo device
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for  adrenal insufficiency, continue
   - Initially concerned for PE, however have more likley explanations for
   hypotension as listed above, LENIs negative
   - Start ACE low dose/short acting for afterload reduction.
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who underwent nephrectomy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. He was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotensive requiring pressors. The patient is suspected to have pneumonia, possibly due to an immunocompromised state from malignancy or progression of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, including coverage for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient's condition remains critical, and he requires ongoing support with mechanical ventilation and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis contribute to poor pulmonary reserve, making him susceptible to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient remains febrile and at risk for secondary infections. Monitoring of the fever curve and white blood cell count is important to detect any worsening infection.
3. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with signs of septic shock, which may recur if there is an inadequate response to the current antibiotic regimen or if a new source of infection develops.
4. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of cardiac dysfunction,"

   SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT APPROXIMATELY 7 a.m.: This
   exam is
   largely unchanged from the prior exam. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric
   tube,
   feeding tube, and right internal jugular catheter are all in unchanged
   positions. Again, the feeding tube terminates above the GE junction.
   Lung volumes remain low and widespread interstitial thickening is
   consistent
   with diffuse fibrosis. A slight relative increase in air space opacity
   at the
   right lung base (most evident when in comparison to the scout film from
   the CT
   torso of [**2120-2-13**]) is largely unchanged, as is a small right pleural
   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and sepsis in patient with
   poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt was dysynchronous w/ vent yesterday w/ decreasing sedation of fent /
   midazolam although methadone was added; oxygenation seems to worsen
   when patient is dysynchronous / less sedated.
   Sats decreased overnight.
   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   - Back on pressure control for now, based on transpulmonary pressure
   (10 and -2), will titrate down FiO2 as tolerated today.   Can consider
   changing to PSV or SIMV with low set respiratory rate if tolerated.
   -Off cisatracurium since [**4-17**].  Currently sedated on midazolam and
   fentanyl on maximal doses.  Will try trial of methadone to help
   decrease versed/fentanyl doses today. Attempt wean as tolerated. Can
   consider propofol in addition in order to lower doses of
   versed/fentanyl.
   # Septic shock: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic with
   fevers and leukocytosis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 54**] ICU was intubated due to
   hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotensive requiring pressors.  Likely
   pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on CXR, although
   difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
   symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH.  At this point, WBC and fever curve
   decreasing. Covered on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly given critical illness.  As patient was on bactrim prophylaxis
   for PCP as outpatient and not on steroids, risk for PCP very low;
   therefore, will dc high dose bactrim and restart ppx dose.
   - D/C [**Name10 (NameIs) **] sun if cultures negative
   - Also on IV steroids for PCP and adrenal insufficiency, see below
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   # Cardiogenic shock: Patient found to have PAH and RV failure on ECHO.
   Started on dobutamine with improvement in CI as well as pressures.
   Also started on captopril for afterload reduction which enabled
   decrease in dobutamine with continued improvement in hemodynamics.
   - Wean dobutamine today
   - Continue to monitor UOP and CI. If UOP decreases, will consider lasix
   drip if patient becomes very positive
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s trended down,  have stopped following.
   - ASA
   - ACEI as above for afterload reduction
   - Consider diuresis if UOP tapers off to further decrease preload.
   # Hypotension: Improved. Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
   presentation of acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with
   hypotension made a septic shock picture predominate, however after
   adequate fluid rescusitation pt continued to require 2 pressors.  His
   TTE and vigileo monitoring were consistent with low cardiac output due
   to pt
s severe pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary fibrosis and
   subsequent RV hypokinesis, a non-fluid responsive state.  Dobutamine
   challenge resulted in increased CO to normal range with ability to be
   weaned off both levophed and vasopressin and addition of captopril
   which led to decreased afterload allowed decrease in dobutamine.  Also,
   initial concern for adrenal insufficiency as patient has one adrenal
   gland with a metastasis, though he does not clinically appear to be
   functionally adrenally insufficient at this point.  UOP remains high at
   ~100-200cc/hour.
   - Continue dobutamine
   - Continue HD monitoring with Vigileo device
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for adrenal insufficiency, will start wean today with
   50mg q12, and subsequent wean over next few days.
   - Initially concerned for PE, however have more likley explanations for
   hypotension as listed above, LENIs negative
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant (SCT), and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
- He has been diagnosed with pneumonia as the likely source of respiratory failure and sepsis.
- The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage for various infections, including Legionella, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and bacterial infections.
- His cardiac status is complicated by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and right ventricular (RV) failure, for which he has been started on dobutamine and captopril.
- The patient's hypotension is thought to be due to a mixed picture of septic shock and cardiogenic shock secondary to RV failure.
- His renal function is impaired, as evidenced by a high urine output.
- There is concern for adrenal insufficiency, but the patient is currently being treated with IV hydrocortisone.
- The patient's metastatic renal cancer has recurred despite previous treatments.
- The patient is receiving nutritional support and prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and fevers suggest a possible pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but there is a need for further evaluation and management of this condition.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension, fevers, and leukocytosis, sepsis is a potential complication that needs to be closely monitored and treated aggressively.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's PAH and RV failure indicate the possibility of cardiogenic shock. Ongoing management with dobutamine and afterload reduction medications is necessary.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's history of metastatic renal cancer and the presence of adrenal gland involvement raise concerns about adrenal insufficiency. Treatment with IV hydrocortisone is appropriate, but monitoring for signs of cortisol deficiency should continue.
5. Metastatic Renal Cancer: The patient's recurrent disease indicates the potential for further complications related to metastatic renal cancer, such as spread to other organs or systemic effects.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Prophylactic measures, including chlorhexidine, have been initiated, but vigilant monitoring for signs of infection is essential.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and clinical judgment are necessary for accurate diagnosis and"

   SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT APPROXIMATELY 7 a.m.: This
   exam is
   largely unchanged from the prior exam. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric
   tube,
   feeding tube, and right internal jugular catheter are all in unchanged
   positions. Again, the feeding tube terminates above the GE junction.
   Lung volumes remain low and widespread interstitial thickening is
   consistent
   with diffuse fibrosis. A slight relative increase in air space opacity
   at the
   right lung base (most evident when in comparison to the scout film from
   the CT
   torso of [**2120-2-13**]) is largely unchanged, as is a small right pleural
   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and sepsis in patient with
   poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt was dysynchronous w/ vent yesterday w/ decreasing sedation of fent /
   midazolam although methadone was added; oxygenation seems to worsen
   when patient is dysynchronous / less sedated.
   Sats decreased overnight and placed back on 50% FiO2.
   Had air trapping w/ high RR; will decrease RR and driving pressure if
   tolerates.
   Cont sedation w/ fent / midazolam / methadone; no urgency in relieving
   sedating w/ high vent needs.
   # Septic shock:
   **Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/ vancomycin,
   levofloxacin, bactrim (now only ppx dosing), caspofungin.
   All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve responding well.  Will
   cont broad coverage for now; consider d/c caspofungin tomorrow if
   cultures negative, since this is unlikely acute fungal pneumonia, and
   more likely bacterial.
   Since responding no need for CT chest currently.
   Also, won
t tolerate bronch at this point, plus diagnostic studies
   probably no longer useful (culture).
   - f/u cultures
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - D/C caspofungin sun if cultures negative
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   **Hypotension
   Now improved BPs, off dobutamine.
   Shock likely mix of septic, cardiogenic, and metabolic (absolute
   adrenal insufficiency).  CVP goal > 8, and meeting that criteria.  From
   cardiac perspective, RV hypokinesis and dysfunction though to be [**2-3**]
   high intrapulmonary pressures (hypoxia, pulmonary fibrosis).  Now able
   to maintain BP off dobutamine.  Although CI decreased, will cont to
   follow urine output and MAP trend.
   For endocrine, pt w/ hx of adrenalectomy and adrenal gland w/ mets.
   - cont IV hydrocortisone taerp.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   # Sedation
   Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was causing
   problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal levels of
   midaz/fentanyl. Now adequately sedated on midax / fent / methadone.
   Cont this regimen for now and hold off on further sedation until
   ventilatory needs decrease.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent a nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant (SCT), and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in the past. He presented to the emergency department with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. The patient has a background of emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pneumonia as the source of respiratory failure and sepsis due to his poor pulmonary reserve. The patient was dysynchronous with the ventilator yesterday, and his sedation was decreased. Oxygenation worsened when the patient was less sedated. The patient's saturation levels decreased overnight, and he was placed back on 50% FiO2. The respiratory rate will be decreased, and driving pressure will be adjusted if tolerated.
2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have septic shock, likely caused by pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, bactrim) and antifungal medication (caspofungin) have been initiated. Cultures are pending, and the patient's white blood cell count and fever curve are responding well. The broad coverage will be continued for now, considering discontinuing caspofungin tomorrow if cultures are negative. Since the"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Septic shock: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic with
   fevers and leukocytosis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 54**] ICU was intubated due to
   hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotensive requiring pressors.  Likely
   pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on CXR, although
   difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
   symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH.  At this point, WBC and fever curve
   decreasing. Covered on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly given critical illness.  As patient was on bactrim prophylaxis
   for PCP as outpatient and not on steroids, risk for PCP very low;
   therefore, will dc high dose bactrim and restart ppx dose.
   - D/C [**Name10 (NameIs) **] sun if cultures negative
   - Also on IV steroids for PCP and adrenal insufficiency, see below
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   - Back on pressure control for now, based on transpulmonary pressure
   (10 and -2), will titrate down FiO2 as tolerated today.   Can consider
   changing to PSV or SIMV with low set respiratory rate if tolerated.
   -Off cisatracurium since [**4-17**].  Currently sedated on midazolam and
   fentanyl on maximal doses.  Will try trial of methadone to help
   decrease versed/fentanyl doses today. Attempt wean as tolerated. Can
   consider propofol in addition in order to lower doses of
   versed/fentanyl.
   # Cardiogenic shock: Patient found to have PAH and RV failure on ECHO.
   Started on dobutamine with improvement in CI as well as pressures.
   Also started on captopril for afterload reduction which enabled
   decrease in dobutamine with continued improvement in hemodynamics.
   - Wean dobutamine today
   - Continue to monitor UOP and CI. If UOP decreases, will consider lasix
   drip if patient becomes very positive
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s trended down,  have stopped following.
   - ASA
   - ACEI as above for afterload reduction
   - Consider diuresis if UOP tapers off to further decrease preload.
   # Hypotension: Improved. Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
   presentation of acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with
   hypotension made a septic shock picture predominate, however after
   adequate fluid rescusitation pt continued to require 2 pressors.  His
   TTE and vigileo monitoring were consistent with low cardiac output due
   to pt
s severe pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary fibrosis and
   subsequent RV hypokinesis, a non-fluid responsive state.  Dobutamine
   challenge resulted in increased CO to normal range with ability to be
   weaned off both levophed and vasopressin and addition of captopril
   which led to decreased afterload allowed decrease in dobutamine.  Also,
   initial concern for adrenal insufficiency as patient has one adrenal
   gland with a metastasis, though he does not clinically appear to be
   functionally adrenally insufficient at this point.  UOP remains high at
   ~100-200cc/hour.
   - Continue dobutamine
   - Continue HD monitoring with Vigileo device
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for adrenal insufficiency, will start wean today with
   50mg q12, and subsequent wean over next few days.
   - Initially concerned for PE, however have more likley explanations for
   hypotension as listed above, LENIs negative
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. He was intubated and admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient's medical history includes emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and a previous mini-allograft stem cell transplant. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, as well as prophylactic medications for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and cytomegalovirus (CMV).

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 52 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 50% FiO2. He is sedated on midazolam and fentanyl, and is being ventilated with pressure control mode.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 10.4 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.7 mmol/L. Imaging studies reveal widespread interstitial thickening consistent with diffuse fibrosis, and a small right pleural effusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned, but there are several significant findings and potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Allergy to Flagyl (Metronidazole): The patient has an allergy to Flagyl, which is important to note as it should be avoided in future medication administration.

2. Recent antibiotic usage: The patient has received multiple antibiotics recently, including Acyclovir, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Caspofungin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). It is important to consider the potential interactions and side effects of these medications.

3. Infusions: The patient is receiving Dobutamine at 0.3 mcg/Kg/min and Midazolam (Versed) at 10 mg/hour. These infusions suggest ongoing cardiac support and sedation.

4. Vital signs: The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.3 C (99.1 F), with a current temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F). Heart rate is within normal range at 52 bpm, but respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 34 breaths per minute. Blood pressure is stable, with a range of 119/51 mmHg to 148/65 mmHg.

   SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT APPROXIMATELY 7 a.m.: This
   exam is
   largely unchanged from the prior exam. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric
   tube,
   feeding tube, and right internal jugular catheter are all in unchanged
   positions. Again, the feeding tube terminates above the GE junction.
   Lung volumes remain low and widespread interstitial thickening is
   consistent
   with diffuse fibrosis. A slight relative increase in air space opacity
   at the
   right lung base (most evident when in comparison to the scout film from
   the CT
   torso of [**2120-2-13**]) is largely unchanged, as is a small right pleural
   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan

   # Septic shock: On presentation to OSH pt hypotensive, hypoxic with
   fevers and leukocytosis. On arrival to [**Hospital1 54**] ICU was intubated due to
   hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotensive requiring pressors.  Likely
   pneumonia given hypoxia and possible opacities on CXR, although
   difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
   symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH.  At this point, WBC and fever curve
   decreasing. Covered on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim IV for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to cover
   broadly given critical illness.  As patient was on bactrim prophylaxis
   for PCP as outpatient and not on steroids, risk for PCP very low;
   therefore, will dc high dose bactrim and restart ppx dose.
   - D/C [**Name10 (NameIs) **] sun if cultures negative
   - Also on IV steroids for PCP and adrenal insufficiency, see below
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending

   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary reserve
   due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt tolerated decrease in PEEP and Fi02 yesterday.  Attempted to switch
   to A/C, however pt less sedated off pressors and pulling large TV
   (~1600), dysynchronous with vent.
   - Back on pressure control for now, based on transpulmonary pressure
   (10 and -2), will titrate down FiO2 as tolerated today.   Can consider
   changing to PSV or SIMV with low set respiratory rate if tolerated.
   -Off cisatracurium since [**4-17**].  Currently sedated on midazolam and
   fentanyl on maximal doses.  Will try trial of methadone to help
   decrease versed/fentanyl doses today. Attempt wean as tolerated. Can
   consider propofol in addition in order to lower doses of
   versed/fentanyl.
   # Cardiogenic shock: Patient found to have PAH and RV failure on ECHO.
   Started on dobutamine with improvement in CI as well as pressures.
   Also started on captopril for afterload reduction which enabled
   decrease in dobutamine with continued improvement in hemodynamics.
   - Wean dobutamine today
   - Continue to monitor UOP and CI. If UOP decreases, will consider lasix
   drip if patient becomes very positive
   # Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable plaque.
   - CE
s trended down,  have stopped following.
   - ASA
   - ACEI as above for afterload reduction
   - Consider diuresis if UOP tapers off to further decrease preload.
   # Hypotension: Improved. Likely a mixed picture. Initially pt
   presentation of acute hypoxia with leukocytosis and fevers with
   hypotension made a septic shock picture predominate, however after
   adequate fluid rescusitation pt continued to require 2 pressors.  His
   TTE and vigileo monitoring were consistent with low cardiac output due
   to pt
s severe pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary fibrosis and
   subsequent RV hypokinesis, a non-fluid responsive state.  Dobutamine
   challenge resulted in increased CO to normal range with ability to be
   weaned off both levophed and vasopressin and addition of captopril
   which led to decreased afterload allowed decrease in dobutamine.  Also,
   initial concern for adrenal insufficiency as patient has one adrenal
   gland with a metastasis, though he does not clinically appear to be
   functionally adrenally insufficient at this point.  UOP remains high at
   ~100-200cc/hour.
   - Continue dobutamine
   - Continue HD monitoring with Vigileo device
   - Treat broadly for infection per above
   - IV hydrocort Q6 for adrenal insufficiency, will start wean today with
   50mg q12, and subsequent wean over next few days.
   - Initially concerned for PE, however have more likley explanations for
   hypotension as listed above, LENIs negative
   - Guaiac stools, HCT has been stable.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. He is currently admitted to the ICU and is being treated for septic shock, respiratory failure due to pneumonia, and cardiogenic shock. The patient has several comorbidities including emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and adrenal insufficiency. He is receiving multiple medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, dobutamine, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is causing his respiratory failure. It is essential to monitor his oxygen saturation levels and adjust the ventilator settings accordingly.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has low cardiac output due to severe pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right ventricular hypokinesis. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and ongoing management of cardiac support are crucial.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has one adrenal gland with a metastasis, and there is a concern for adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of urine output and electrolyte imbalances is necessary, and the weaning of hydrocortisone should be done carefully.
4. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: The patient has recurrent metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Regular monitoring of tumor markers and follow-up with the oncology team is important.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   #ID: Causs of sepsis unclear. Continue antibiotics, f/u cultures.
   #Septic/cardiogenic shock:Off dobutamine. CI lower, but maintaining BP.
   Continue to monitor. Continue afterload reduction with Ace inhibitor
   #Sedation: On Methadone, versed/fentanyl. Current level of sedation
   adequate. Will consider further wean once vent requirements have

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma who was admitted with severe respiratory failure and cardiogenic/septic shock. The patient has right ventricular hypoplasia and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has undergone several changes in medication, including weaning off antibiotics, stress dose steroids, and dobutamine. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/60 mmHg to 148/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's CVP is 31.4 mmHg, CO/CI is 4.3 L/min, and total fluid input/output balance is 5,654 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 176. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, tachycardia, and sedation. Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows continued bilateral infiltrates, and microbiology results are pending. The patient remains dependent on ventilatory support and will be weaned off sedation once vent requirements improve. The patient's condition is critical.

   Assessment and Plan
   #Respiratory failure/ARDS: Remains vent-dependent on pressure control
   ventilation: Recheck ABG after decreasing vent rate. Want to decrease
   borderline transpulm pressure- likely will further reduce PC
   #ID: Causes of sepsis unclear. Continue antibiotics, f/u cultures.
   #Septic/cardiogenic shock:Off dobutamine. CI lower, but maintaining BP.
   Continue to monitor. Continue afterload reduction with Ace inhibitor
   #Sedation: On Methadone, versed/fentanyl. Current level of sedation
   adequate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory failure/pneumonia, cardiogenic/septic shock, and right ventricular (RV) hypoplasia. The patient has been weaned off antibiotics, stress dose steroids, and dobutamine. The patient's allergies include Flagyl (Metronidazole) with a rash. 

The patient is currently on various infusions including midazolam (Versed) at 10 mg/hour and fentanyl at 400 mcg/hour. Other medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), famotidine (Pepcid), and lactulose. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/60 mmHg to 148/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 76.3 kg, and height is 68 inches. 

The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 31.4 mmHg, cardiac output (CO)/cardiac index (CI) is 4.3 L/min/2.3 L/min/m², total input/output balance is 5,654 mL in and 3,280 mL out, urine output is 3,280 mL, and fluid balance is 2,374 mL positive. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a mode of PCV+, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 39 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Pplateau) of 34 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is deferred due to PEEP > 10, and the patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 176. The patient's ventilation rate is set at 30 breaths per minute, and spontaneous breathing effort (SBE) is deferred.

The patient's physical examination findings include normocephalic head, endotracheal tube, no nasogastric or orogastric tube. Peripheral vascular examination shows pulses in all extremities but was not assessed. Neurologic examination reveals the patient responding to commands but not assessed otherwise.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 130 x 10^9/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1."

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and sepsis in patient with
   poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Overnight w/ ? mucous plugging and decreased compliance.  Overall not
   tolerating vent wean well.
   Cont sedation w/ fent / midazolam / methadone; no urgency in relieving
   sedating w/ high vent needs.
   - eval PM ABG for possible vent wean
   # Septic shock:
   **Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/ vancomycin,
   levofloxacin, bactrim (now only ppx dosing), caspofungin.
   All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve responding well.
   D/C caspo today, as this is unlikely acute fungal pneumonia, and more
   likely bacterial.
   Also, won
t tolerate bronch at this point, plus diagnostic studies
   probably no longer useful (culture).
   - f/u cultures
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - D/C caspofungin sun if cultures negative
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   **Hypotension
   Now improved BPs, off dobutamine.
   Shock likely mix of septic, cardiogenic, and metabolic (absolute
   adrenal insufficiency).  CVP goal > 8, and meeting that criteria.  From
   cardiac perspective, RV hypokinesis and dysfunction though to be [**2-3**]
   high intrapulmonary pressures (hypoxia, pulmonary fibrosis).  Now able
   to maintain BP off dobutamine.  Although CI decreased, will cont to
   follow urine output and MAP trend.
   For endocrine, pt w/ hx of adrenalectomy and adrenal gland w/ mets.
   - cont IV hydrocortisone taerp.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   # Sedation
   Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was causing
   problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal levels of
   midaz/fentanyl. Now adequately sedated on midax / fent / methadone.
   Cont this regimen for now and hold off on further sedation until
   ventilatory needs decrease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who underwent nephrectomy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, donor lymphocyte infusion, and has a past medical history of emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia as the likely source of respiratory failure and septic shock. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, bactrim (now only prophylactic dosing), and caspofungin. His white blood cell count and fever curve are responding well. It is planned to discontinue caspofungin if cultures are negative. Other cultures are pending, and he is also being monitored for Legionella. The patient's hypotension has improved, and he is no longer on dobutamine. He is thought to have a mix of septic, cardiogenic, and metabolic (absolute adrenal insufficiency) shock. His central venous pressure goal is above 8, and he is meeting that criteria. The patient has a history of adrenalectomy and adrenal gland metastasis. He will continue IV hydrocortisone taper. His metastatic renal cell carcinoma is recurrent despite previous treatment. He will be discussed with the BMT team. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and sepsis in patient with
   poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt was dysynchronous w/ vent yesterday w/ decreasing sedation of fent /
   midazolam although methadone was added; oxygenation seems to worsen
   when patient is dysynchronous / less sedated.
   Sats decreased overnight and placed back on 50% FiO2.
   Had air trapping w/ high RR; will decrease RR and driving pressure if
   tolerates.
   Cont sedation w/ fent / midazolam / methadone; no urgency in relieving
   sedating w/ high vent needs.
   # Septic shock:
   **Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/ vancomycin,
   levofloxacin, bactrim (now only ppx dosing), caspofungin.
   All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve responding well.  Will
   cont broad coverage for now; consider d/c caspofungin tomorrow if
   cultures negative, since this is unlikely acute fungal pneumonia, and
   more likely bacterial.
   Since responding no need for CT chest currently.
   Also, won
t tolerate bronch at this point, plus diagnostic studies
   probably no longer useful (culture).
   - f/u cultures
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - D/C caspofungin sun if cultures negative
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   **Hypotension
   Now improved BPs, off dobutamine.
   Shock likely mix of septic, cardiogenic, and metabolic (absolute
   adrenal insufficiency).  CVP goal > 8, and meeting that criteria.  From
   cardiac perspective, RV hypokinesis and dysfunction though to be [**2-3**]
   high intrapulmonary pressures (hypoxia, pulmonary fibrosis).  Now able
   to maintain BP off dobutamine.  Although CI decreased, will cont to
   follow urine output and MAP trend.
   For endocrine, pt w/ hx of adrenalectomy and adrenal gland w/ mets.
   - cont IV hydrocortisone taerp.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   # Sedation
   Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was causing
   problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal levels of
   midaz/fentanyl. Now adequately sedated on midax / fent / methadone.
   Cont this regimen for now and hold off on further sedation until
   ventilatory needs decrease.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and sepsis may be caused by pneumonia. The presence of fever, hypoxia, and decreased oxygenation suggests a lung infection.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis. The fever curve and WBC count are responding well to treatment, indicating improvement. However, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of sepsis and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension initially but has now improved and is off dobutamine. The hypotension may be due to a combination of septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and metabolic causes such as absolute adrenal insufficiency. It is crucial to maintain the CVP goal of >8 and continue to monitor the blood pressure and urine output.

4. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of metastatic renal cancer and adrenalectomy increases the risk of cardiogenic shock. The RV hypokinesis and dysfunction suggest compromised cardiac function. Monitoring the cardiac status and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.

5. Metastatic renal cancer: The patient has recurrent metastatic renal cancer, which may require further interventions such as chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The BMT team should be involved in the patient's care and decisions regarding treatment.

6. Adrenal insufficiency: The"

   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and sepsis in patient with
   poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt was dysynchronous w/ vent yesterday w/ decreasing sedation of fent /
   midazolam although methadone was added; oxygenation seems to worsen
   when patient is dysynchronous / less sedated.
   Sats decreased overnight and placed back on 50% FiO2.
   Had air trapping w/ high RR; will decrease RR and driving pressure if
   tolerates.
   Cont sedation w/ fent / midazolam / methadone; no urgency in relieving
   sedating w/ high vent needs.
   # Septic shock:
   **Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/ vancomycin,
   levofloxacin, bactrim (now only ppx dosing), caspofungin.
   All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve responding well.  Will
   cont broad coverage for now; consider d/c caspofungin tomorrow if
   cultures negative, since this is unlikely acute fungal pneumonia, and
   more likely bacterial.
   Since responding no need for CT chest currently.
   Also, won

   probably no longer useful (culture).
   - f/u cultures
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - D/C caspofungin sun if cultures negative
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   **Hypotension
   Now improved BPs, off dobutamine.
   Shock likely mix of septic, cardiogenic, and metabolic (absolute
   adrenal insufficiency).  CVP goal > 8, and meeting that criteria.  From
   cardiac perspective, RV hypokinesis and dysfunction though to be [**2-3**]
   high intrapulmonary pressures (hypoxia, pulmonary fibrosis).  Now able
   to maintain BP off dobutamine.  Although CI decreased, will cont to

   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   # Sedation
   Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was causing
   problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal levels of

- Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to poor pulmonary reserve caused by emphysema, possible graft versus host disease (GVHD), and pulmonary fibrosis. He is experiencing dysynchrony with the ventilator, leading to worsening oxygenation when less sedated.
- Sepsis shock: The likely source of sepsis is pneumonia. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, bactrim (now only prophylactic dosing), and caspofungin. His WBC count and fever curve are responding well, and cultures are pending.
- Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, and he no longer requires dobutamine. The cause of hypotension is likely a mix of septic, cardiogenic, and metabolic (absolute adrenal insufficiency) factors. His central venous pressure (CVP) is above 8"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. 

1. The patient's EKG at 06:04 PM showed a sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 26 beats per minute. This can be indicative of an underlying cardiac condition or medication side effects.

2. The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating. Initially, the respiratory rate was decreased from 36 to 30 breaths per minute, and the driving pressure was increased to 26 from 28. The patient also exhibited agitation and increased respiratory rate after changing the ventilator settings. Overnight, there was a decrease in tidal volumes and changes in compliance, suggesting possible lung issues. A chest X-ray showed new opacification in the left mid lung/lingula region, which could indicate a lung infection or consolidation.

3. The patient has allergies to Flagyl (Oral) (Metronidazole) and has received multiple antibiotics including Bactrim (SMX/TMP), Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Caspofungin, Acyclovir, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). These medications may have been prescribed due to suspected infections or to prevent potential infections.

4. The patient is on various infusions such as Fentanyl for pain management and Heparin Sodium as a prophylaxis for thrombosis. Other ICU medications include Famotidine (P"

   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and sepsis in patient with
   poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Pt was dysynchronous w/ vent yesterday w/ decreasing sedation of fent /
   midazolam although methadone was added; oxygenation seems to worsen
   when patient is dysynchronous / less sedated.
   Sats decreased overnight and placed back on 50% FiO2.
   Had air trapping w/ high RR; will decrease RR and driving pressure if
   tolerates.
   Cont sedation w/ fent / midazolam / methadone; no urgency in relieving
   sedating w/ high vent needs.
   # Septic shock:
   **Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/ vancomycin,
   levofloxacin, bactrim (now only ppx dosing), caspofungin.
   All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve responding well.  Will
   cont broad coverage for now; consider d/c caspofungin tomorrow if
   cultures negative, since this is unlikely acute fungal pneumonia, and
   more likely bacterial.
   Since responding no need for CT chest currently.
   Also, won
t tolerate bronch at this point, plus diagnostic studies
   probably no longer useful (culture).
   - f/u cultures
   - Legionella urine ag negative, all other cultures no growth to date.
   - D/C caspofungin sun if cultures negative
   - Glucan, galactomannan  pending
   - Follow WBC count, fever curve, decreasing
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   **Hypotension
   Now improved BPs, off dobutamine.
   Shock likely mix of septic, cardiogenic, and metabolic (absolute
   adrenal insufficiency).  CVP goal > 8, and meeting that criteria.  From
   cardiac perspective, RV hypokinesis and dysfunction though to be [**2-3**]
   high intrapulmonary pressures (hypoxia, pulmonary fibrosis).  Now able
   to maintain BP off dobutamine.  Although CI decreased, will cont to
   follow urine output and MAP trend.
   For endocrine, pt w/ hx of adrenalectomy and adrenal gland w/ mets.
   - cont IV hydrocortisone taerp.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   # Sedation
   Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was causing
   problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal levels of
   midaz/fentanyl. Now adequately sedated on midax / fent / methadone.
   Cont this regimen for now and hold off on further sedation until
   ventilatory needs decrease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who underwent a nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. The patient has poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia as a source of respiratory failure and sepsis. His poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema and fibrosis makes him vulnerable to further complications.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis, which may progress if the infection is not controlled.

3. Metastatic Renal Cancer: The patient has recurrent metastatic renal cancer and is scheduled for a bone marrow transplant. This treatment poses additional risks and potential complications.

4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenalectomy and adrenal gland metastasis, increasing the risk of absolute adrenal insufficiency. He is receiving IV hydrocortisone taper.

5. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, which needs close monitoring and management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant (SCT), and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. The patient has emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and is on home oxygen. He is currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and sepsis, likely secondary to the pneumonia. The patient is sedated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. He also has cardiogenic shock with a dilated hypokinetic right ventricle (RV), but his blood pressures are improving off dobutamine. The patient has a history of adrenalectomy and is suspected to have absolute adrenal insufficiency. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal therapy, and antiviral prophylaxis. His metabolic parameters and other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's current plan includes diuresis to improve oxygenation, maintaining FiO2 and PEEP levels, no changes to A/C volume-controlled settings, and decreasing driving pressure to reduce intrathoracic pressures and prevent barotrauma. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with renal cancer and mixed cardiogenic shock. He has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to pneumonia (PNA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with pulmonary fibrosis. The patient also has dilated right ventricle (RV). 

In terms of recent medical events, the patient's ventilator settings were decreased, but he became agitated with desaturation and required suctioning. A new left lingular process was observed on the chest X-ray (CXR). The patient's tidal volume (TF) increased, and he received various medications including caspofungin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), acyclovir, vancomycin, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, heparin sodium, famotidine (Pepcid), and others.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/64 to 144/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and sinus bradycardia. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 4.5 L/min, and cardiac index (CI) is 2.4 L/min/m². Fluid balance shows an intake"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypoxic respiratory failure, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and dilated right ventricle. He is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure with sepsis and cardiogenic causes. The patient is sedated and not able to move spontaneously. His vital signs include a heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/51 mmHg to 136/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and temperature of 37.4°C. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a decreased rate and pressure, and has experienced desaturation events. A new lingular process was noted on the chest X-ray.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics including Bactrim, Levofloxacin, Caspofungin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Acyclovir. He is also receiving midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, famotidine, and other medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies show bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and microbiology tests are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include acute respiratory failure, sepsis, and possible pulmonary embol"

   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.  Overall not tolerating vent wean well.  Driving pressures
   decreased over the day yesterday.
   Cont sedation w/ fent / midazolam / methadone; no urgency in relieving
   sedating w/ high vent needs.
   - Diuresed significantly on lasix gtt, now autodiuresising, goal I/O
   500-1000mL neg to improve oxygenation now that BP / shock has resolved.
   Will continue to monitor
   - No changes to FiO2 / Peep until oxygenation improves
   - No change to A/C as patient has been tolerating PCV well
   - Decrease driving pressure again today and re-eval abg in attempt to
   reduce intrathoracic pressures and barotrauma
   # Shock: Multifactorial
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing),
   caspofungin.  All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve
   improving slightly.
   - D/C caspo when beta glucan / galactomannan negative per BMT
   - F/u cultures, will pan-culture today as no micro since [**2120-4-16**].
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day course, now
   [**7-15**]
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. W/ dilated hypokinetic RV,
   likely causative in hypotension.  Now BP recovering well.  Increased
   ACEI yesterday for BP contol and afterload reduction which patient has
   tolerated well. No further change today
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia.  ? med effect.  Sustaining blood pressure
   well, no need for atropine.
   QTc: prolonged mimimally to 485.  Cont check EKG w/ levofloxacin,
   methadone.
   **Endocrine
   ? absolute adrenal insufficiency, appears unlikely as patient was not
   on steroids at home.  Pt w/ hx of adrenalectomy and adrenal gland w/
   mets.
   - 60 mg po prednisone today and cont w/ rapid PO pred taper, decrease
   to 40->20->10 then off.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   # Sedation:  Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was
   causing problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal
   levels of midaz/fentanyl. Now adequately sedated on midax / fent /
   methadone.
   - Cont current regimen for now. Will titrate sedation as tolerated
   trying to minimize agitation as this has been interfering with his
   ventilation.

   poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD, fibrosis.
   Overnight w/ ? mucous plugging and decreased compliance.  Overall not
   tolerating vent wean well.
   Cont sedation w/ fent / midazolam / methadone; no urgency in relieving
   sedating w/ high vent needs.
   - Diurese 500-1000mL in attempt improve oxygenation now that BP / shock
   has resolved
   - No changes to FiO2 / Peep until oxygenation improves
   - No change to A/C
 volume controlled setting
   - Decrease driving pressure and re-eval abg in attempt to reduce
   intrathoracic pressures and barotrauma
   # Shock:
   Multifactorial
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, bactrim (now only ppx dosing), caspofungin.
   All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve responding well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). He is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and shock. The patient has severe chronic pulmonary disease (COPD/fibrosis) and is experiencing a mixed septic/cardiogenic picture with acute respiratory failure due to a probable infection superimposed on right ventricular failure and pulmonary hypertension. The patient remains on high ventilator support, is tolerating small decreases in driving pressures, and is auto-diuresing. His hemodynamics are stable without the need for pressors or fluids. The patient is also dealing with sepsis/pneumonia, bradycardia (sinus origin), and adrenal insufficiency. He is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated, and his medications are being adjusted accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure and diffuse infiltrates on CXR indicate a high risk for ARDS. Close monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged ventilator use, there is an increased risk for VAP. Appropriate measures such as head-of-bed elevation, oral care, and regular assessment of respiratory secretions will help prevent VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and fibrosis, and was admitted with respiratory failure and shock. The patient has a mixed septic/cardiogenic picture, with respiratory failure likely due to a probable infection superimposed on right ventricular (RV) failure and pulmonary hypertension (pHTN). He also has severe chronic pulmonary disease/COPD/fibrosis. The patient remains on high ventilator support and is tolerating small decreases in driving pressure. His hemodynamics are unchanged, not requiring pressors or fluids, and he tolerated an increase in ACE-I. There are no changes in the antibiotic regimen, and the patient will undergo pan culture. Capsofungin will be continued until galactomanan returns. Bradycardia is of sinus origin, and the patient's blood pressure is tolerating. Steroids for adrenal insufficiency are being tapered. The patient's wife was updated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's condition could worsen if there is further deterioration in lung function or if the underlying infection is not effectively managed.
2. Sepsis/Pneumonia: If the infection spreads or becomes more severe, it could lead to sepsis or pneumonia, which may require additional interventions such as more aggressive antibiotic therapy or"

   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.  Overall not tolerating vent wean well.  Driving pressures
   decreased over the day yesterday.
   Cont sedation w/ fent / midazolam / methadone; no urgency in relieving
   sedating w/ high vent needs.
   - Diuresed significantly on lasix gtt, now autodiuresising, goal I/O
   500-1000mL neg to improve oxygenation now that BP / shock has resolved.
   Will continue to monitor
   - No changes to FiO2 / Peep until oxygenation improves
   - No change to A/C as patient has been tolerating PCV well
   - Decrease driving pressure again today and re-eval abg in attempt to
   reduce intrathoracic pressures and barotrauma
   # Shock: Multifactorial
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing),
   caspofungin.  All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve
   improving slightly.
   - D/C caspo when beta glucan / galactomannan negative per BMT
   - F/u cultures, will pan-culture today as no micro since [**2120-4-16**].
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day course, now
   [**7-15**]
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. W/ dilated hypokinetic RV,
   likely causative in hypotension.  Now BP recovering well.  Increased
   ACEI yesterday for BP contol and afterload reduction which patient has
   tolerated well. No further change today
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia.  ? med effect.  Sustaining blood pressure
   well, no need for atropine.
   QTc: prolonged mimimally to 485.  Cont check EKG w/ levofloxacin,
   methadone.
   **Endocrine
   ? absolute adrenal insufficiency, appears unlikely as patient was not
   on steroids at home.  Pt w/ hx of adrenalectomy and adrenal gland w/
   mets.
   - 60 mg po prednisone today and cont w/ rapid PO pred taper, decrease
   to 40->20->10 then off.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
   # Sedation:  Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was
   causing problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal
   levels of midaz/fentanyl. Now adequately sedated on midax / fent /
   methadone.
   - Cont current regimen for now. Will titrate sedation as tolerated
   trying to minimize agitation as this has been interfering with his
   ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal carcinoma, who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. The patient has emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is sedated with fentanyl, midazolam, and methadone. His vital signs show a heart rate of 41 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/60 to 182/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has sinus bradycardia and is warm with 2+ pitting edema to mid-thigh. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 12.1-12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8-11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 120-174 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.8-1.0 mg/dL. 

The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia, sepsis secondary to the pneumonia, cardiogenic shock with dilated hypokinetic right ventricle, prolonged QTc, and possible absolute adrenal ins"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. The patient has emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 41 bpm, blood pressure of 133/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 120 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen level of 20 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, sodium level of 134 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, chloride level of 98 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.2 mEq/L, glucose level of 122 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 32.5 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, shock, cardiogenic, endocrine, metastatic renal cancer, and sedation. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and caspofungin, due to suspected pneumonia and sepsis. His fluid balance is positive with an intake of 5,866 mL and output of 5,850 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination findings include decreased breath sounds bilaterally, coarse crackles in the right lower lung field, and no peripheral edema. His neurologic examination shows no focal deficits, and his peripheral vascular examination reveals no abnormalities.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and nosocomial infections. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and infection parameters is crucial."

   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.
   - Had difficulty with agitation and dropping sats yesterday; had to
   initially increase fent/midaz despite methadone, was then started on
   profol, but has since been significantly weaned with good O2 sats and
   no agitation
   - Decrease PEEP to 10 to continuing weaning as tolerated; hold on
   driving pressures for now since patient has compensatory respiratory
   acidosis for metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to auto-diuresis.
   - No change to A/C as patient has been tolerating PCV well
   - remove esophageal balloon
   - call IP to discuss placing trach.
   # Sedation:  Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was
   causing problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal
   levels of midaz/fentanyl. Started on propofol for worsening agitation
   causing desats
   - goal for today to increase methadone to 20 mg Q3H, decrease fentanyl
   and propofol, but if agitation/desats occurs, can use fentanyl boluses
   rather than increasing gtt again
   # Shock: Multifactorial
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing),
   caspofungin.  All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve
   improving slightly.
   - D/C caspo when beta glucan / galactomannan negative per BMT
   - F/u cultures- cont to culture with spikes.  Currently afebrile x >24H
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day course.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. dilated hypokinetic RV,
   likely causative in hypotension.  Now BP recovering well.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated. BP stable
   QTc: prolonged mimimally to 485.  Cont check EKG w/ levofloxacin,
   methadone.
   **Endocrine
   - cont w/ rapid PO pred taper, decrease to 40->20->10 then off.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, and mini-allograft stem cell transplantation. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. 

The patient has been agitated and required high doses of fentanyl, versed, and methadone for sedation. Due to agitation and dropping oxygen saturation, propofol was added but has since been significantly weaned with good oxygen saturation and no agitation. 

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and there are concerns about pneumonia as the likely source of respiratory failure and sepsis. 

The patient's sedation regimen has been adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation. 

There are multiple factors contributing to the patient's shock, including sepsis likely due to pneumonia and cardiogenic causes related to a dilated hypokinetic right ventricle. 

The patient's endocrine management includes a rapid prednisone taper. 

The patient has recurrent metastatic renal cancer and will be followed by the BMT team. 

ICU care includes tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and sepsis.
2. Sepsis secondary to pneumonia.
3. Cardiogenic shock due to a dil"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.
   - PEEP decreased to 10 which patient tolerated well (PaO2 104). Did not
   tolerated PEEP decrease to 8 (increased agitation).  PEEP increased
   back to 10 with good response.
   - Sedation on vent, see below
   - No change in PEEP today as did not tolerate, would not change driving
   pressures either as patient now has compensatory respiratory acidosis
   for metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to auto-diuresis.
   - Attempt decrease in FiO2 today (50->40%) as repeat gas this am showed
   7.44/51/109
   - No change to A/C as patient has been tolerating PCV well; once
   sedation is decreased, can consider changing to PSV today.  Changing
   mode of ventilation would likely be next consideration as he will
   likely continue to require high PEEPs
   - Esophageal balloon removed
   - Plan for trach by IP today with anesthesia
   # Sedation:  Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was
   causing problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal
   levels of midaz/fentanyl. Started on propofol for worsening agitation
   causing desats
   -Changed back to methadone q4H, decreasing fentanyl (now off this
   morning).   Also weaning versed (now at 2mg/hr) and preferentially
   using propofol for sedation (currently at 25 requiring occasional
   boluses for agitation).
    - Goal to wean off versed today and keep patient comfortable, awake if
   possible and calm with sedation regimen.
   # Shock: Multifactorial
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing),
   caspofungin.  All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve
   improving slightly.
   - D/C caspo when beta glucan / galactomannan negative per BMT
   - F/u cultures- cont to culture with spikes.  Currently afebrile x >24H
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day course, today
   is day 6.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Now hypertensive.  Increasing to 25mg TID today.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated.  Continue to
   follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine
   - Cont w/ rapid PO pred taper, decrease to 10 tomorrow then off.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx for now, will discuss with BMT

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplantation, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/72 to 182/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophilia, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The chest X-ray shows little overall change. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia and sepsis. He is also experiencing cardiogenic shock, likely due to dilated hypokinetic right ventricle, and sinus bradycardia. 

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and caspofungin, as well as prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. 

The patient's sedation regimen has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers and
   hypotension.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.
   - PEEP decreased to 10 which patient tolerated well (PaO2 104). Did not
   tolerated PEEP decrease to 8 (increased agitation).  PEEP increased
   back to 10 with good response.
   - Sedation on vent, see below
   - No change in PEEP today as did not tolerate, would not change driving
   pressures either as patient now has compensatory respiratory acidosis
   for metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to auto-diuresis.
   - No change to A/C as patient has been tolerating PCV well
   - Esophageal balloon removed
   - Plan for trach by IP on Thursday
   # Sedation:  Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was
   causing problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal
   levels of midaz/fentanyl. Started on propofol for worsening agitation
   causing desats
   - Changed back to methadone q4H, decreasing fentanyl (now at
   50mcg/hr).   Also weaning versed (now at 2mg/hr) and preferentially
   using propofol for sedation (currently at 25).
   - Can still use fentanyl boluses prn if necessary for agitation
   # Shock: Multifactorial
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing),
   caspofungin.  All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve
   improving slightly.
   - D/C caspo when beta glucan / galactomannan negative per BMT
   - F/u cultures- cont to culture with spikes.  Currently afebrile x >24H
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day course, tdaoy
   is day 6.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Now hypertensive.  Can consider increasing to 25mg TID.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated.  Continue to
   follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine
   - Cont w/ rapid PO pred taper, decrease to 40->20->10 then off.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx for now, will discuss with BMT

   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.   Patient is now s/p trach/PEG this morning.
   - PEEP decreased to 10 which patient tolerated well. Did not tolerated
   PEEP decrease to 8 (increased agitation).  Will maintain current PEEP
   at 10
   - Would not change driving pressures either as patient now has
   compensatory respiratory acidosis for metabolic alkalosis likely
   secondary to auto-diuresis.
   - Attempt decrease in FiO2 today (50->40%) -> maintain PaO2 >60
   - Patient did tolerate AC during trach today when he was completely
   sedated, though he did not tolerate this prior.  Once sedation is
   decreased, can consider changing to PSV.  He will likely continue to
   require high PEEPs
   # Sedation:  Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was
   causing problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal
   levels of midaz/fentanyl. Started on propofol for worsening agitation
   causing desats
   - On methadone q4H, fentanyl and versed off.  On propofol for sedation,
   currently at 45 mcg/kg/min.  Off fent/versed drips.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, will check triglycerides.
   - Bolus fentanyl/ativan prn agitation
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplantation, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His condition has been improving, but he is having difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, which can be a common complication in immunocompromised patients like those with a history of cancer and stem cell transplantation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple lines and tubes, which can serve as potential sources of infection.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may be secondary to his underlying emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis, GVHD (graft-versus-host disease), or fibrosis. Monitoring his cardiac function and managing any underlying causes is crucial.
4. Difficulty Weaning from Ventilator: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator suggests a possible respiratory muscle weakness or dysfunction, which can be associated with his underlying lung conditions or complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Sedation/Agitation: The patient requires ongoing sedation to tolerate"

   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic
   shock, now improving but with difficulty weaning vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.
   - PEEP decreased to 10 which patient tolerated well (PaO2 104). Did not
   tolerated PEEP decrease to 8 (increased agitation).  PEEP increased
   back to 10 with good response.
   - Sedation on vent, see below
   - No change in PEEP today as did not tolerate, would not change driving
   pressures either as patient now has compensatory respiratory acidosis
   for metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to auto-diuresis.
   - Attempt decrease in FiO2 today (50->40%) as repeat gas this am showed
   7.44/51/109
   - Plan for trach by IP today with anesthesia
   - No change to A/C as patient has been tolerating PCV well; once
   sedation is decreased/trach in place, can consider changing to PSV.
   Changing mode of ventilation would likely be next consideration as he
   will likely continue to require high PEEPs
   # Sedation:  Goals of sedation have been clarified; being too light was
   causing problems w/ oxygenation.  Pt also was requiring supra-normal
   levels of midaz/fentanyl. Started on propofol for worsening agitation
   causing desats
   - On methadone q4H, fentanyl and versed off.  On propofol for sedation,
   currently at 45 mcg/kg/min.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today (though will await placement
   of trach before making sedation changes).
   # Shock: Multifactorial
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing),
   caspofungin.  All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve
   improving slightly.
   - D/C caspo when beta glucan / galactomannan negative per BMT
   - F/u cultures- cont to culture with spikes.  Currently afebrile x >24H
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day course, today
   is day 7.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Now hypertensive.  Increased to 25mg TID.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated.  Continue to
   follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine
   - Cont w/ rapid PO pred taper, decrease to 10 today then off.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx for now, will discuss with BMT

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, fevers, and hypotension secondary to sepsis and cardiogenic shock. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, which could be the source of his sepsis and poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema and possible graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and fibrosis.
2. Sepsis: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis, and his WBC and fever curve is improving slightly. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen as needed.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to dilated hypokinetic right ventricle (RV). He was previously on dobutamine but has improved, and now he is on captopril for afterload reduction.
4. Endocrine Disturbances: The patient is receiving a rapid prednisone taper and will be followed closely for any endocrine disturbances, such as adrenal insufficiency.
5. Metastatic Renal Cancer: The patient has recurrent metast"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic
   shock, now improving but with difficulty weaning vent and s/p
   trach/PEG.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.   Patient is now s/p trach/PEG.
   - PEEP decreased to 5 yesterday after trach which he has tolerated
   well.  Last ABG 7.49/34/127.
   - Driving pressures decreased this am from 24 to 20.  Will check ABG on
   current settings.
   - Attempt decrease in FiO2 today (50->40%) -> maintain PaO2 >60.
   Patient's oxygenation has improved.
   - Can also attempt PSV trial today if able to adequately wean sedation
   without agitation.
   - Plan to replace trach today by IP given persistent air leak.
   # Sedation:  Currently on methadone q4H, and propofol for sedation,
   currently at 20 mcg/kg/min.  Off fent/versed drips.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, triglycerides mildly
   elevated at 182
   - Continue to check triglycerides twice weekly while on propofol.
   - Bolus fentanyl/ativan prn agitation
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H
   # Shock: Multifactorial, resolved.
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing).  All
   cultures pending or no growth.  WBC stable.  Patient with temp 100.8
   rectal this am during rounds.  Blood cx/urine cx sent.
   - D/C'd caspo yesterday
   - F/u cultures - cont to culture with spikes.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day
   course, today is day 10.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Now hypertensive.  Increased to 25mg TID.  Will likely need repeat ECHO
   once acute issues resolved to assess for resolution of RV dysfunction.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated.  Continue to
   follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine
   - Prednisone off today
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has had several interventions, including percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. He also received broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and bactrim. Additionally, he was started on antifungal therapy with caspofungin but it was discontinued due to negative results for fungal infection markers.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/69 mmHg to 96/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 95%. His central venous pressure is 8 mmHg, and he has received a total of 2,694 mL of fluids since midnight.

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2 of 254 mmHg, and HCO3- of 36 mmol/L. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between "

   - Attempt decrease in FiO2 today (50->40%) -> maintain PaO2 >60.
   Patient's oxygenation has improved.
   - Will decrease RR today to see if patient can breath over the vent on
   his own.  Then can consider decreased driving pressure.
   - Plan to replace trach today by IP given persistent air leak.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. He has undergone several interventions including percutaneous tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs are stable, but he has persistent air-leak from the trach site. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but his triglycerides are mildly elevated at 182.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, which puts him at high risk for respiratory failure. The pneumonia is likely the source of his current respiratory failure and sepsis.

2. Sepsis: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat suspected sepsis. His WBC count and fever curve are improving, indicating a positive response to treatment. However, cultures are still pending, and there is a risk of developing further infections.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially had cardiogenic shock, which has improved but could potentially recur. He is off dobutamine and on captopril for afterload reduction. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and heart function is necessary.

   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic
   shock, now improving but with difficulty weaning vent and s/p
   trach/PEG.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.   Patient is now s/p trach/PEG.
   - PEEP decreased to 5 yesterday after trach which he has tolerated
   well.  Last ABG 7.49/34/127.
   - Would not change driving pressures either as patient now has
   compensatory respiratory acidosis for metabolic alkalosis likely
   secondary to auto-diuresis.
   - Attempt decrease in FiO2 today (50->40%) -> maintain PaO2 >60.
   Patient's oxygenation has improved.
   - Will decrease RR today to see if patient can breath over the vent on
   his own.  Then can consider decreased driving pressure.
   - Plan to replace trach today by IP given persistent air leak.
   # Sedation:  Currently on methadone q4H, fentanyl and versed off.  On
   propofol for sedation, currently at 30 down from 45 mcg/kg/min.  Off
   fent/versed drips.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, triglycerides mildly
   elevated at 182
   - Continue to check triglycerides twice weekly while on propofol.
   - Bolus fentanyl/ativan prn agitation
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H
   # Shock: Multifactorial
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing),
   caspofungin.  All other cultures pending.  WBC and fever curve
   improving slightly.
   - D/C'd caspo yesterday
   - F/u cultures - cont to culture with spikes.  Currently afebrile x
   >24H
   - PPD negative
   - Continue acyclovir ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day course, today
   is day 8.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Now hypertensive.  Increased to 25mg TID.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated.  Continue to
   follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine
   - Prednisone off today
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is within normal range (37.6°C), heart rate is slightly elevated (91 bpm), blood pressure is stable (130/69 mmHg), respiratory rate is increased (29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is good (94% on FiO2 of 50%).
- Physical examination: The patient is sedated but has localized to voice, pupils are equal and reactive, chest auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally, abdomen is moderately distended with bowel sounds present, and trace pitting edema is noted in the mid-thighs.
- Laboratory results: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, slightly elevated lactate level of 2.0 mmol/L, mildly elevated triglycerides at 182 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo man with metastatic renal cell CA s/p allo- SCT with subsequent
   severe chronic resp failure thought to be emphysema and fibrosis of
   unclear etiology (CT from last spring demonstrates severe cystic and
   fibrotic changes with almost no normal appearing lung) presented with 2
   wk prodrome, presented with catastrophic acute on chronic failure. CXR
   shows diffuse opacification c/w ARDS. Severe shock, initially presumed
   septic but more predominantly cardiogenic. RV with global hypokinesis,
   dilated, mod-sev PAH. Responded well to dobutamine. Was on high dose
   steroids, now tappered off.
   Slowly improving.
   Abx: Vanco/Levoflox/Zosyn/bactrim and acyclovir  prophylaxis
   #CARDIOGENIC SHOCK-resolved, PAH, RV FAILURE
   Stable on increased dose captopril for afterload reduction, mildly
   hypertensive.  Autodiuresing.  Rpt TTE in a couple of weeks.
    #Hypoxemic resp failure s/p trach, to be changed today given cuff
   leak.  Tolerating wean of driving pressure and peep.  PS trial post
   trach change today.
   No sig changes on vent today, given s/p trach this morning and on PEEP

   #INFECTION
   D10/14 empiric vanc/zosyn/levoflox, also on prophylactic bactrim and
   acyclovir.  Febrile this am- pan cx.
   #Sedation
   Off fentanyl and versed. Continues on propofol and methadone w/bolus
   ativan as needed for pain/agitation.  Cont to wean propofol.  Will
   decrease methadone to q6 then q8, after come down further on propofol.
   QTc okay. TG fine on propofol, check BIW.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). He presented with severe chronic respiratory failure thought to be emphysema and fibrosis of unclear etiology. The patient's condition worsened, leading to a catastrophic acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. A chest X-ray showed diffuse opacification consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient also experienced severe shock, initially presumed to be septic but more predominantly cardiogenic. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with global hypokinesis, dilatation, and moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was observed. The patient responded well to dobutamine therapy. He was on high-dose steroids, which have since been tapered off.

The patient's current condition is slowly improving. He is on antibiotic prophylaxis and has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, bactrim, and acyclovir. The patient is tolerating weaning of driving pressure and PEEP. A tracheostomy was performed, and the cuff leak needs to be addressed today. Plans for post-tracheostomy changes and pressure support trials are in place.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within"

   FINDINGS:
   On today's examination, there is worsening opacification seen in both
   lungs,
   predominantly in the mid and lower regions. The chronic interstitial
   lung
   disease is stable. The heart size is within normal limits. Minimal
   present
   pleural effusion is again noted with no change. The ET tube is 4.6 cm
   from
   the carina.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. The acute changes noted in both lungs favor edema, although
   aspiration
   cannot be completely excluded.
   2. Chronic interstitial lung fibrotic disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic
   shock, now improving but with difficulty weaning vent and s/p
   trach/PEG.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.   Patient is now s/p trach/PEG on [**4-25**]. PEEP yesterday
   decreased to 5 yesterday after trach placement.  Pt has small cuff
   leak.  IP had evaluated this am and wanted to continue to monitor for
   now.  This am pt agitated, low 02 sats.  Has increasing Fi02
   requirement from 40% now up to 60%.
   -increase PEEP to 8, temporarily switch to volume control to ensure
   adequate tidal volumes on increased PEEP in setting of cuff leak.
   - Driving pressures decreased this am from 24 to 20.  Will check ABG on
   current settings.
   - Attempt decrease in FiO2 today (50->40%) -> maintain PaO2 >60.
   Patient's oxygenation has improved.
   - Can also attempt PSV trial today if able to adequately wean sedation
   without agitation.
   - Plan to replace trach today by IP given persistent air leak.
   # Sedation:  Currently on methadone q4H, and propofol for sedation,
   currently at 20 mcg/kg/min.  Off fent/versed drips.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, triglycerides mildly
   elevated at 182
   - Continue to check triglycerides twice weekly while on propofol.
   - Bolus fentanyl/ativan prn agitation
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H
   # Shock: Multifactorial, resolved.
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing).  All
   cultures pending or no growth.  WBC stable.  Patient with temp 100.8
   rectal this am during rounds.  Blood cx/urine cx sent.
   - D/C'd caspo yesterday
   - F/u cultures - cont to culture with spikes.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day
   course, today is day 10.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Now hypertensive.  Increased to 25mg TID.  Will likely need repeat ECHO
   once acute issues resolved to assess for resolution of RV dysfunction.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated.  Continue to
   follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine
   - Prednisone off today
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. Currently, he is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and bactrim), antivirals (acyclovir), sedatives (methadone and propofol), and cardiac medications (captopril for afterload reduction). He also has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place.

The patient's recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, PaO2 of 112, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure range of 116-130 mmHg, heart rate between 67-138 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 13-30 breaths per minute, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray indicates worsening opacification in both lungs, suggesting possible edema or pneumonia. The chronic interstitial lung disease remains stable. The impression is acute changes in"

He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with difficulty weaning off. The patient also has emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
- Heart rate: 67 bpm
- Blood pressure: 116/67 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 93%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has received various medications and treatments, including antibiotics (such as vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam), sedatives (propofol and methadone), and antivirals (acyclovir).

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 13.6-15.0 thousand/mm³
- Hematocrit: 31.6-34.0%
- Platelet count: 149-159 thousand/mm³
- Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 65-76 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, which is a likely source of sepsis. Given the patient's poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and potential graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), weaning off the ventilator may be challenging.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam) for suspected pneumonia-related sepsis. However, cultures are pending, and the patient still has a fever.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient had multifactorial shock that has resolved. He was treated with dobutamine and is now on captopril for afterload reduction. There is concern for right ventricular dysfunction, which may require further evaluation with an echocardiogram.
4. Metastatic Renal Cancer: The patient has recurrent metastatic renal cancer and is being managed with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, but he still faces challenges related to respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and ongoing management of his metastatic renal cancer."

   FINDINGS:
   On today's examination, there is worsening opacification seen in both
   lungs,
   predominantly in the mid and lower regions. The chronic interstitial
   lung
   disease is stable. The heart size is within normal limits. Minimal
   present
   pleural effusion is again noted with no change. The ET tube is 4.6 cm
   from
   the carina.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. The acute changes noted in both lungs favor edema, although
   aspiration
   cannot be completely excluded.
   2. Chronic interstitial lung fibrotic disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic
   shock, now improving but with difficulty weaning vent and s/p
   trach/PEG.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.   Patient is now s/p trach/PEG on [**4-25**]. PEEP yesterday
   decreased to 5 yesterday after trach placement.  Pt has small cuff
   leak.  IP had evaluated this am and wanted to continue to monitor for
   now.  This am pt agitated, low 02 sats.  Has increasing Fi02
   requirement from 40% now up to 60%.
   -increase PEEP to 8, temporarily switch to volume control to ensure
   adequate tidal volumes on increased PEEP in setting of cuff leak.
   - Driving pressures decreased yesterday from 24 to 20. Continue to
   monitor patient if persistent breathing over vent consider resuming
   prior pressures.
   -attempted PS yesterday, pt became hypotensive.  Now on pressure
   control.
   -treat PNA for planned 14 day course.  B-glucan, galactomannan
   negative, caspogungin d/c
   # Sedation:  Currently on methadone q4H, and propofol for sedation,
   currently at 20 mcg/kg/min.  Off fent/versed drips, using fentanyl and
   lorazepam boluses for agitation.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, triglycerides mildly
   elevated at 182
   - Continue to check triglycerides twice weekly while on propofol. Last
   checked [**4-26**]
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H
   # Shock: Multifactorial, resolved.
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing).  All
   cultures pending or no growth.  WBC stable.
   - D/C'd caspo yesterday
   - F/u cultures - cont to culture with spikes.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day
   course, today is day 10.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Now hypertensive.  Increased to 25mg TID [**4-25**].  Will likely need repeat
   ECHO once acute issues resolved to assess for resolution of RV
   dysfunction.
   -will decrease captopril to 12.5 TID in setting of hypotension
   yesterday.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated.  Continue to
   follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine: relative adrenal [**Name2 (NI) 2411**]
   - Prednisone off today
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx

   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic
   shock, now improving but with difficulty weaning vent and s/p
   trach/PEG.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.   Patient is now s/p trach/PEG.
   - PEEP decreased to 5 yesterday after trach which he has tolerated
   well.  Last ABG 7.49/34/127.
   - Driving pressures decreased this am from 24 to 20.  Will check ABG on
   current settings.
   - Attempt decrease in FiO2 today (50->40%) -> maintain PaO2 >60.
   Patient's oxygenation has improved.
   - Can also attempt PSV trial today if able to adequately wean sedation
   without agitation.
   - Plan to replace trach today by IP given persistent air leak.
   # Sedation:  Currently on methadone q4H, and propofol for sedation,
   currently at 20 mcg/kg/min.  Off fent/versed drips.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, triglycerides mildly
   elevated at 182
   - Continue to check triglycerides twice weekly while on propofol.
   - Bolus fentanyl/ativan prn agitation
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H
   # Shock: Multifactorial, resolved.
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing).  All
   cultures pending or no growth.  WBC stable.  Patient with temp 100.8
   rectal this am during rounds.  Blood cx/urine cx sent.
   - D/C'd caspo yesterday
   - F/u cultures - cont to culture with spikes.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day
   course, today is day 10.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Now improved BPs, off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Now hypertensive.  Increased to 25mg TID.  Will likely need repeat ECHO
   once acute issues resolved to assess for resolution of RV dysfunction.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives; increases
   with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as tolerated.  Continue to
   follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine
   - Prednisone off today
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. The patient presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. He is currently in the ICU and has difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/67 mmHg to 130/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 60% FiO2.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including propofol for sedation, methadone for pain management, antibiotics for sepsis coverage, antivirals, and other supportive care medications.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by pneumonia, which is likely the source of his respiratory failure and sepsis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 470 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%."

   Patient with increased interstitial and some alveolar edema noted in
   background of fibrosis
   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo male with history metastatic renal cell CA admit with respiratory
   failure and now s/p trach and PEG and prolonged vent weaning.  He has
   been limited by persistent hypoxemia which may be related to underlying
   pulmonary disease in addition to loss of functional lung in the setting
   of prolonged intubation and will need to move to successful PSV wean
   with hemodynamic stability.
   Respiratory Failure-
   This is combination of chronic pulmonary disease and significant
   obstruction and restriction now with significant evidence of worsening
   of the pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid bolus over past 24
   hours.  He had continued need for maximum support.  This morning he has
   significant hypoxemia persisting and needs continued stable support.
   -Increase PEEP to 8 this am
   -Increase sedation to allow more passive ventilatory support
   -Will likely maintain PCV in place
   -Will move to diuresis if we can given hemodynamic instability
   -His leak from the ventilator
   Hypotension-
   He had significant sepsis and with an initial resolution.  At this time
   he has had some intermittent hypotension which is likely due to
   vasodilatory effects of sedating medications and has had some evidence
   of increased volume overload with bolus treatment over past 24 hours.
   -ECG wtihout changes
   -IVF bolus as needed
   -ECHO if persistent
   Sepsis-
   Continue with broad spectrum ABX
   F/U culture results
   Altered Mental Status-
   -Methadone q 4 hours, Fentanyl as needed, Ativan as needed with goal to
   maintain stable sedation
   -Look to wean propofol as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted with respiratory failure.
- He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and has been experiencing prolonged ventilator weaning.
- The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to a combination of chronic pulmonary disease, significant obstruction, restriction, and worsening pulmonary edema.
- The patient requires maximum ventilatory support, and it is planned to increase PEEP to 8 and maintain PCV mode.
- The patient also has episodes of hypotension, likely due to vasodilatory effects of sedating medications and fluid overload.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and further culture results will be followed.
- The patient's altered mental status is managed with methadone, fentanyl, and ativan to maintain stable sedation.
- ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and requires close monitoring and management.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of worsening pulmonary edema, which needs to be addressed through diuretic therapy and fluid restriction.
3. Hypotension: The patient's intermittent hypotension may indicate sepsis or fluid overload and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. He underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement on 04-25. The patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator and is currently on assisted ventilation with a pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode. The patient also has emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, which may contribute to his respiratory issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been having difficulty weaning off the ventilator, and there is concern for pneumonia as a likely source of respiratory failure. Given his poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and fibrosis, careful monitoring and management of his respiratory status is essential.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat sepsis, likely originating from pneumonia. All microbiology cultures are pending or showing no growth. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory values to assess the effectiveness of the antibiotic therapy.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has shown improvement in his cardiac status, but there is a concern for ongoing dilated hypokinetic right ventricle (RV) dysfunction. Close monitoring of blood pressure and consideration for repeat ech"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cancer, who underwent nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-allograft stem cell transplant, and donor lymphocyte infusion. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. Currently, he is improving but has difficulty weaning off the ventilator and has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, which increases his risk for respiratory failure. Pneumonia is a likely source of respiratory failure and sepsis due to his poor pulmonary reserve. There is also concern for tracheostomy cuff leak, which may require replacement after a few days.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. All microbiology results are pending or showing no growth, indicating ongoing efforts to treat and prevent sepsis.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has improved but still requires close monitoring for any signs of recurrent cardiogenic shock, especially considering his dilated hypokinetic right ventricle. A repeat echocardiogram may be necessary once acute issues are resolved.
4. Metastatic renal cancer: The patient has recurrent disease post-donor lymphocyte transplant, and further management"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT,
   DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic
   shock, now improving but with difficulty weaning vent and s/p
   trach/PEG.
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.   Patient is now s/p trach/PEG on [**4-25**]. PEEP decreased to 5
   after trach placement which patient has been tolerating.  He does,
   however, have a trach leak, hard to quantify amount of leak.  IP has
   evaluated and would like to wait until track is more healed prior to
   changing trach.  Has increasing Fi02 requirement from 40% up to 60%
   since yesterday.
   - Continue PEEP of 5 on PCV given concern over cuff leak by RT, plan
   for replacement of cuff by IP after a few days when trach is not so
   new
   - Driving pressures maintained at 24. FiO2 at 60% now with sats in the
   low 90s.  Last gas 7.36/51/105.  Will attempt decrease in FiO2 to 50%
   this morning.
   - Can attempt PS trial later if sedation weaned and patient alert
   enough to tolerate.
   - Treat PNA for planned 14 day course.  See below.  B-glucan,
   galactomannan negative, caspogungin d/c
   # Sedation:  Currently on methadone q4H, and propofol for sedation,
   currently at 35 mcg/kg/min.  Off fent/versed drips, using fentanyl and
   lorazepam boluses for agitation.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, triglycerides mildly
   elevated at 182
   - Continue to check triglycerides twice weekly while on propofol. Last
   checked [**4-26**]
   - Will bolus with versed/fentanyl prn agitation in an attempt to wean
   down level of propofol.
   - Continue to check daily ECG for QTc prolongation on methadone.
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H
   # Shock: Multifactorial, improved.
   ** Sepsis: Likely source pneumonia.  On very broad coverage w/
   vancomycin, levofloxacin, zosyn, bactrim (now only ppx dosing) and
   acyclovir ppx.  All cultures pending or no growth.  WBC stable.
   - D/C'd caspo
   - F/u cultures - cont to culture with spikes.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx, vanc/zosyn/levoflox for 14 day
   course, today is day 12.
   **Cardiogenic
   ## Pump: Had improved BPs off dobutamine. On captopril for afterload
   reduction. Dilated hypokinetic RV, likely causative in hypotension.
   Currently on captopril 12.5mg TID decreased yesterday in the setting of
   hypotension requiring a fluid bolus.  Patient has not been receiving
   captopril given BPs in the high 80s and 90s.
   - Will get repeat ECHO now to evaluate pump function as patient had
   been hypertensive, now hypotensive. ?decreased forward flow [**2-3**] poor
   pump function vs. intravascular volume depletion as partially
   responsive to fluids.
   - Continue to monitor BP for now, prn IVFto maintain MAPs >65.
   ## Rhythm: Sinus bradycardia likely secondary to sedatives, largely
   resolved; increases with agitation.  Cont weaning sedation as
   tolerated.  Continue to follow QTc for prolongation given methadone and
   levoflox, has been wnl
   **Endocrine: relative adrenal [**Name2 (NI) 2411**]

   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx
   # Access: Multilumen has been in place sinc ethe 14^th. Will request
   PICC for now, pull line once PICC in place.  Will also get PIV access

   50 yo male with metastatic renal cell ca and pulmonary fibrosis and now
   with prolonged ventilator weaning secondary to persistent hypercarbic
   compromise.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with multiple challenges most prominently
   pulmonary fibrosis and modest pulmonary edema in addition making
   oxygenation a primary challenge.  In addition the destructive lung
   disease makes progress a challenge.  He will need continued high levels
   of support until oxygenation can be stabilized.
   -PCV to continue
   -Will consider trach change to minimize cuff leak when stable
   -Wean O2 and move to keep SaO2 >90% and move to 0.5 for FIO2
   -Will move to PSV trial when effective Ve requirement is understood.
   2)Pneumonia
continue ABX for 14 day course
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -Will move to Propofol wean if possible
   -Hope to be able to tolerate wean with better defined ventilator
   support
   -Continue trials of weaning
   4)Sepsis-
   Hemodynamically improved
   Cardiogenic contribution will be managed with efforts at afterload
   reduction if BP tolerates
   Continue with Abx
   Could consider ECHO to eval current function

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and pulmonary fibrosis, currently experiencing prolonged ventilator weaning due to persistent hypercarbic compromise. The patient has a history of sepsis, pneumonia, and altered mental status. He is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory condition is a major concern, as he has multiple challenges such as pulmonary fibrosis and modest pulmonary edema. Oxygenation is a primary challenge, and the patient will need continued high levels of support until it can be stabilized.

2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for pneumonia with a 14-day course of antibiotics. Continued antibiotic therapy is necessary to prevent complications and further infection.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be attributed to sedation or other underlying conditions. Propofol wean and continued trials of weaning are planned to manage this condition.

4. Sepsis: Although the patient has shown improvement in hemodynamics, sepsis remains a concern. Continued administration of antibiotics is essential to manage the infection. Efforts at afterload reduction may also be considered to address any cardiogenic contribution to the patient's condition.

5. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to prolonged immobility in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   50-year-old man with recrudescent severe shock and respiratory failure,
   on a background of renal cell CA .
   Shock
   Etiology here is uncertain.  Sepsis is most likely, but PE
   For sepsis
 cover MRSA and VRE, cover ESBL and other resistant GNR
   (change to meropenem and IV quinolone), and for C diff (oral vanco;
   discuss his Flagyl allergy with his prior providers).  Will discuss
   antifungal coverage with BMT.  Check other cultures. (CMV,
   galactomannan, etc.)  Consult ID for advice on antibiotics.
   Check KUB and upright CXR to exclude free air.  He is too sick for
   travel and for operation.
   Treat empirically for adrenal insufficiency.  Add on cortisol to
   morning labs.
   Check echo.  Check EKG since heart rate is relatively low.
   Follow and replete ionized calcium.
   Heparinize empirically for PE.  Discuss with BMT whether he would be a
   candidate for lytics if we documented PE (his metastatic disease in the
   spine makes it unlikely).
   Place central line after heparin is held for an hour.
   Respiratory failure
   Esophageal-balloon guided settings for PEEP and driving pressure.
   Has marked respiratory acidosis that seems to be mostly related to high
   dead-space fraction.
   Will try to increase respiratory rate and watch for autoPEEP.
   Bradycardia
   Appears to be a junctional rhythm.  Will replete all lytes including
   calcium, etc.
   Try to swap to Levophed for
   Acute renal failure
   Secondary to hemodynamics.  Follow for now.
   Acidosis
   Mostly related to respiratory acidosis, although his bicarb has fallen
   over the past days as well.
   Since he has a lactic (and respiratory) acidosis, will hold off on
   bicarbonate for now.

   Assessment and Plan
   50-year-old man with recrudescent severe shock and respiratory failure,
   on a background of renal cell CA .
   Shock
   Etiology here is uncertain.  Sepsis is most likely, but PE
   For sepsis
 cover MRSA and VRE, cover ESBL and other resistant GNR
   (change to meropenem and IV quinolone), and for C diff (oral vanco;
   discuss his Flagyl allergy with his prior providers).  Will discuss
   antifungal coverage with BMT.  Check other cultures. (CMV,
   galactomannan, etc.)  Consult ID for advice on antibiotics.
   Check KUB and upright CXR to exclude free air.  He is too sick for
   travel and for operation.
   Treat empirically for adrenal insufficiency.  Add on cortisol to
   morning labs.
   Check echo.  Check EKG since heart rate is relatively low.
   Follow and replete ionized calcium.
   Heparinize empirically for PE.  Discuss with BMT whether he would be a
   candidate for lytics if we documented PE (his metastatic disease in the
   spine makes it unlikely).
   Place central line after heparin is held for an hour.
   Respiratory failure
   Esophageal-balloon guided settings for PEEP and driving pressure.
   Has marked respiratory acidosis that seems to be mostly related to high
   dead-space fraction.
   Will try to increase respiratory rate and watch for autoPEEP.
   Bradycardia
   Appears to be a junctional rhythm.  Will replete all lytes including
   calcium, etc.
   Try to swap to Levophed for
   Acute renal failure
   Secondary to hemodynamics.  Follow for now.
   Acidosis
   Mostly related to respiratory acidosis, although his bicarb has fallen
   over the past days as well.
   Since he has a lactic (and respiratory) acidosis, will hold off on
   bicarbonate for now.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   7pm addendum
   Major events today:
   (1)     pressor requirement improved
   (2)     central line placed without incident.  CVP was only 7
   (3)     Respiratory acidosis improved more than expected based on
   ventilator manipulations
   (4)     Family meeting at 12:30
   (5)     Echo shows no tamponade; RV is perhaps larger than prior echo
   (6)     LENIs (-)
   (7)     Formal jugular doppler confirmed our findings of RIJ DVT
   (8)     Episode of coffee grounds
   Overall, although he remains tremendously ill he has improved
   substantially compared with earlier today.  This (along with the IJ
   DVT) suggests that the primary mechanism here may have been a PE in a
   patient with an already compromised RV and pulmonary status
 and that
   he may now be having some auto-lysis of the clot.  His coffee grounds
   (in addition to his malignancy) means that TPA is contraindicated at
   present.  We will do our best to continue heparin and support with
   transfusions as needed.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old male with recrudescent severe shock and respiratory failure, on a background of renal cell carcinoma. The etiology of shock is uncertain, but sepsis is suspected. The patient has been treated empirically for MRSA and VRE, ESBL and other resistant gram-negative rods, C. difficile (oral vancomycin), and possible adrenal insufficiency. 

The patient also has respiratory failure, with marked respiratory acidosis that seems to be mostly related to a high dead-space fraction. Esophageal-balloon guided settings for PEEP and driving pressure have been tried, and the patient's respiratory rate is being increased to watch for autoPEEP.

The patient appears to have bradycardia, possibly a junctional rhythm, and will be repleted with all electrolytes including calcium. Acute renal failure is secondary to hemodynamics, and the patient's acidosis is mostly related to respiratory acidosis, although his bicarbonate has fallen over the past days as well.

The patient has a lactic (and respiratory) acidosis, so bicarbonate will be withheld for now. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is NPO, and regular insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control. Various lines have been placed, including a CVL, 20 and 18 gauge lines, PICC line, and arterial line. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with systemic antico"

He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has difficulty weaning off the ventilator. He has been sedated and paralyzed to facilitate ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis for which he is on home oxygen. He has allergies to Flagyl (metronidazole) and developed a rash after taking it. The last doses of antibiotics he received were Acyclovir, Levofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Vancomycin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/64 mmHg to 175/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg, and he is receiving fluids and blood products.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 60 mmHg,"

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   50 y/o M w. metastatic renal cell cancer s/p nephrectomy, IL-2,
   mini-SCT, DLI 2x in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home O2
   presented to OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic
   shock now with difficulty weaning vent and s/p trach/peg
   .
   #Hypotension: At this time impression is most consistent with septic
   shock given fevers, elevated lactate, leukocytosis.  [**Month (only) 60**] also be
   cardiogenic/obstructive shock from a PE or from pericardial tamponade.
   Has RV dysfunction at baseline.  At this time will continue
   -          Possible Sepsis: Given fevers on broad antibiotics will
   broaden to cover ESBL-GNR
s and VRE.  Change vancomycin to linezolid
   given need to cover pulmonary source in this hypoxic patient.  Will
   also change zosyn to meropenem for above.  Will hold on fungal coverage
   given not neutropenic and fungal studies have been negative.
   Tobramycin for resistant GNR
s.  Consider broadening PRN.
   -          Rising WBC count also concerning for C. Diff infection.
   Started on PO vanco overnight.  Change to IV flagyl this AM and PR
   vanco given high residuals and lack of absorption.
   -          ID consult today -> ? IV Ig.
   -          Cardiogenic Shock: Unclear what component may be related to
   obstructive shock from PE, EKG this AM with junctional rhythm with no
   clear P-waves.   Do not believe this is ischemic, but will obtain TTE
   today for ? effusion/tamponade/thrombus.
   -          Hypovolemic Shock:  Less likely. With bloody NG lavage today
   after starting heparin.  Q6h HCT and stop heparin gtt only for
   significant GI bleed.
   -          Adrenal: Has adrenal involvement from renal cell carcinoma.
   Will check AM cortisol today.  Given hydrocortisone x1.
   -          Continue pressors with vasopressin,and uptitrate levophed
   and down titrate neosynephrine.  Check ionized calcium this AM and
   ensure replete.
   -          Continue acyclovir and bactrim PPx.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia as likely source of resp failure and
   sepsis in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema, ?GVHD,
   fibrosis.   However, increasing CO2 requirement concerning for PE and
   will continue heparin gtt today given clinical improvement since
   starting.  No trach leak on exam this AM as per respiratory.  Now on
   100% FIO2.  Patient is now s/p trach/PEG on [**4-25**].   CXR this AM with
   increasing opacities c/w pneumonia/edema.
   - continue heparin gtt at this time.
   - will not diurese given hypotension
   - Continue on current vent setting for now.
   - Driving pressures maintained at 24. FiO2 at 100% now with sats in the
   low 90s.  Last gas7.05/88/132/26/-8.
   - Treat PNA for planned 14 day course.  See below.  B-glucan,
   galactomannan negative, caspogungin d/c
   # Sedation:  continue fentanyl, cisatracurium, midazolam.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, triglycerides mildly
   elevated at 182
   - Continue to check triglycerides twice weekly while on propofol. Last
   checked [**4-26**]
   - Will bolus with versed/fentanyl prn agitation in an attempt to wean
   down level of propofol.
   - Continue to check daily ECG for QTc prolongation on methadone.
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H
   .
   #GI Bleeding: [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI while on heparin gtt given black on lavage.
   Will follow and hold heparin for GI bleed.  Q6H hematocrit for now.
   -          continue to follow.
   .
   # Pump: As above.  TTE today, hold captopril.
   .
   # Rhythm: Sinus at times with junction rhythm on occasion.  Continue to
   monitor.  Telemetry/TTE.
   # Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
   transplant [**12-8**].
   - BMT to follow -> to give input on code status and discussions with
   family regarding severity of illness at this time.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim ppx
   # Access: Central line today, with upper extremity ultrasound
   guidance.  PIV.  A-Line.

   respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock now with difficulty
   weaning the vent s/p trach and peg.
   .
   #Hypotension: At this time feel sepsis with contribution of DVT/PE is
   most likely cause for hypotension.  Patient improved overnight with
   decreased pressor requirement after fluid boluses and starting heparin
   gtt.  Continue IVF
s today with goal CVP 10-12 as tolerated by
   pulmonary status.
   -          Sepsis:  No clear source, ? GI/ C.Diff, afebrile last 24
   hours suggesting response to antibiotics.  Will continue
   meropenem/linezolid/tobramycin/caspofungin/Flagyl and PO Vancomycin in
   addition to bactrim/acyclovir PPx.  IV Ig given yesterday for severe
   sepsis in immunocompromised host.  Will continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics today.
   -          Treating empirically for C. Diff infection at this time.
   Restarted PO vancomycin as patient not retaining PR vancomycin.  C.
   Diff negative x1, resend stool cultures.  Consider d/c of PO vanco if
   stool toxin
s negative.
   -          Appreciate ID Rec
   -          Cardiogenic Shock: Likely some component may be related to
   obstructive shock from PE, patient with mildly increase in RV pressure
   overload on last Echo so not clearly
   -          Hypovolemic Shock:  Less likely. With bloody NG lavage today
   after starting heparin.  Q6h HCT and stop heparin gtt only for
   significant GI bleed.
   -          Adrenal: Normal cortisol, and hypotension improving so not
   adding steroids at this point.  Consider if patient decompensates or
   cannot be weaned of pressors.
   -          Follow calcium and replete.
   -          Continue acyclovir and bactrim PPx.

   # Respiratory failure:  Pneumonia with small PE likely source of resp
   failure and in patient with poor pulmonary reserve due to emphysema,
   ?GVHD, fibrosis.   However, increasing CO2 requirement concerning for
   PE and with RIJ thrombosis by ultrasound.  Will continue heparin gtt
   today.  Adjust vent settings PRN with goal pH 7.2 or greater, and
   transpulmonary pressures of 25 or less.
   - continue heparin gtt at this time.
   - Maintain CVP 10-12 and would not diurese unless increasingly hypoxic
   and CVP elevated.
   - Treat PNA for planned 14 day course.  See below.  B-glucan,
   galactomannan negative, caspogungin d/c
   .
   # Sedation:  continue fentanyl, cisatracurium, midazolam.
   - Goal to wean propofol as tolerated today, triglycerides mildly
   elevated at 182
   - Continue to check triglycerides twice weekly while on propofol. Last
   checked [**4-26**]
   - Will bolus with versed/fentanyl prn agitation in an attempt to wean
   down level of propofol.
   - Continue to check daily ECG for QTc prolongation on methadone.
   - When able, will decrease methadone to q6H then to q8H
   .
   #Acute Liver Injury: Likely [**2-3**] to hypotension.  Trend LFT
s.  Review
   current medications for possible heaptotoxins.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely [**2-3**] to ATN.  Renal dose meds. Urine
   lytes, Ua.
   -          Continue IVF
s, making good UOP.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely oozing in setting of heparin gtt.  T. Bili normal this
   AM arguing against hemolysis but with elevated LDH will check
   haptoglobin.  Will check q6H Hct today, and transfuse PRN for Hct < 21,
   or give blood if need to give IV fluids today.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Low likelihood of HIT. [**Month (only) 60**] be [**2-3**] infection,
   medication effect, DIC.  Will send smear, DIC labs today.  Transfuse
   PRN for platelets < 50 given concern for active bleeding.  Also d/c
   heparin gtt if platelets <50.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who has undergone multiple treatments including nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-SCT, and DLI. He is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and hypotension. The patient has a history of pulmonary fibrosis and is on home oxygen. He is sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia. There is a concern for a pulmonary embolism (PE) as well. Respiratory failure can lead to further hypoxia and potential cardiac arrest.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, leading to cardiogenic shock. This condition is characterized by inadequate blood flow to meet the body's demands, resulting in organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and contribute to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma and is at risk for AKI"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who has undergone nephrectomy, IL-2 therapy, mini-superior vena cava syndrome, and donor lymphocyte infusion. The patient is currently in the ICU due to pulmonary fibrosis, hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock. The patient has difficulty weaning off the ventilator after tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy.

24-hour Events:
- EKG showed junctional rhythm, in and out of sinus overnight.
- Transthoracic echo showed minimal increase in right ventricular pressure overload and pleural effusion.
- Multi-lumen central line started and positioned correctly.
- Ultrasound revealed a clot in the right internal jugular vein, no lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Heparin was restarted after mini-balloon atrial septostomy.
- Hypotension and pressors: Weaned off norepinephrine and levophed, now off vasopressin. Ionized calcium was replenished.
- Respiratory: Improved on assist-control ventilation during the day but had difficulty maintaining adequate minute ventilation overnight. The patient was switched back to pressure control ventilation transiently, with a CVP of 12-15 mmHg. Cisatracurium dosage was increased, and the patient improved with a repeat ABG showing pH 7.21/70/104/30 on A/C. Currently on A/C with tidal volume of 340 mL, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, FiO2 of 70%, and 6 cmH2O PEEP. Last transpulmonary pressure of 30 mmHg.
- ID: Started meropenem, linezolid, tobramycin, and caspofungin as per ID team. Also given one dose of IV Ig for severe sepsis in an immunocompromised host.
- Cardiac: Transthoracic echo yesterday showed mild increase in right ventricular pressure overload and new pleural effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   50-year-old man with metastatic renal cell cancer s/p BMT now with
   multiple organ failure
   recrudescent severe shock
          Main differential here is pulmonary embolism (with
   pre-existing severe pulmonary parenchymal and vascular disease and RV
   dysfunction) and sepsis.
          Continue ABX as directed by ID
          Transfuse today given ongoin bleeding, anemia, and relative
   hypovolemia
   recrudescent severe respiratory failure with a very high dead space
   fraction
          Heparinze for
   acute hepatitis (likely ischemic/shock liver)
          Review meds with ID and pharmacy
   GI bleed
   IV PPI twice a day
   Will try to keep heparinized for now, given high risk of death if RIJ
   clot embolized
   acute renal failure (likely ischemic, althoug postrenal is not fully
   excluded)
   acidosis
   thrombocytopenia
   HIT seems unlikely given ongoing prior exposure
   TTP seems unlikely given timing
   Medications (ABX, ??IVIG) certainly possible
   Follow platelets again today.  If continues to fall, hold heparin.
   Will discuss with heme/onc and ID today
   Shock
   Etiology here is uncertain. Sepsis is most likely, but PE
   For sepsis
 cover MRSA and VRE, cover ESBL and other resistant GNR
   (change to meropenem and IV quinolone), and for C diff (oral vanco;
   discuss his Flagyl allergy with his prior providers). Will discuss
   antifungal coverage with BMT. Check other cultures. (CMV,
   galactomannan, etc.) Consult ID for advice on antibiotics.
   Check KUB and upright CXR to exclude free air. He is too sick for
   travel and for operation.
   Treat empirically for adrenal insufficiency. Add on cortisol to morning
   labs.
   Check echo. Check EKG since heart rate is relatively low.
   Follow and replete ionized calcium.
   Heparinize empirically for PE. Discuss with BMT whether he would be a
   candidate for lytics if we documented PE (his metastatic disease in the
   spine makes it unlikely).
   Place central line after heparin is held for an hour.
   Respiratory failure
   Esophageal-balloon guided settings for PEEP and driving pressure.
   Has marked respiratory acidosis that seems to be mostly related to high
   dead-space fraction.
   Will try to increase respiratory rate and watch for autoPEEP.
   Bradycardia
   Appears to be a junctional rhythm. Will replete all lytes including
   calcium, etc.
   Try to swap to Levophed for
   Acute renal failure
   Secondary to hemodynamics. Follow for now.
   Acidosis
   Mostly related to respiratory acidosis, although his bicarb has fallen
   over the past days as well.
   Since he has a lactic (and respiratory) acidosis, will hold off on
   bicarbonate for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with metastatic renal cell cancer who underwent a bone marrow transplant. He is currently experiencing multiple organ failure, severe shock, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute hepatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and shock. The patient's condition is critical, and several potential medical complications have arisen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms, including severe respiratory failure and right ventricular dysfunction, suggest a possible pulmonary embolism.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic state is indicated by the presence of multiple organ failure, shock, and positive blood cultures.
3. Acute hepatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and jaundice suggest acute hepatitis, which may be ischemic or due to shock.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's coffee grounds emesis and low hemoglobin levels indicate a gastrointestinal bleed.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure, which is likely ischemic in nature.
6. Acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate levels and elevated lactate levels indicate metabolic acidosis.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count suggests thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

          Main differential here is pulmonary embolism (with
   pre-existing severe pulmonary parenchymal and vascular disease and RV
   dysfunction) and sepsis.
          Continue ABX as directed by ID
          Heparinize
          Keep CVP >12 (higher, if his oxygenation and ventilation
   will tolerate).  Vasopressor support as needed.
          Transfuse today given ongoing bleeding, anemia, and relative
   hypovolemia
   recrudescent severe respiratory failure with a very high dead space
   fraction
          Heparinze for suspected PE (+ RIJ DVT)
          Esophageal-pressure-targeted ventilation.  Keep
   transpulmonary pressure as low as possible while keeping pH > 7.20.  If
   TPP goes up and acidemic, would consider bicarbonate
   acute hepatitis (likely ischemic/shock liver)
          Review meds with ID and pharmacy to avoid hepatotoxicity
          Expect bilirubin to come up in next day or so.
   GI bleed
   IV PPI twice a day
   Will try to keep heparinized for now, given high risk of death if RIJ
   clot embolized
   acute renal failure (likely ischemic, althoug postrenal is not fully
   excluded)
   acidosis
   thrombocytopenia
   HIT seems unlikely given ongoing prior exposure
   TTP seems unlikely given timing
   Medications (ABX, ??IVIG) certainly possible
   Follow platelets again today.  If continues to fall, hold heparin.
   Will discuss with heme/onc and ID today
   Shock
   Etiology here is uncertain. Sepsis is most likely, but PE
   For sepsis
 cover MRSA and VRE, cover ESBL and other resistant GNR
   (change to meropenem and IV quinolone), and for C diff (oral vanco;
   discuss his Flagyl allergy with his prior providers). Will discuss
   antifungal coverage with BMT. Check other cultures. (CMV,
   galactomannan, etc.) Consult ID for advice on antibiotics.
   Check KUB and upright CXR to exclude free air. He is too sick for
   travel and for operation.
   Treat empirically for adrenal insufficiency. Add on cortisol to morning
   labs.
   Check echo. Check EKG since heart rate is relatively low.
   Follow and replete ionized calcium.
   Heparinize empirically for PE. Discuss with BMT whether he would be a
   candidate for lytics if we documented PE (his metastatic disease in the
   spine makes it unlikely).
   Place central line after heparin is held for an hour.
   Respiratory failure
   Esophageal-balloon guided settings for PEEP and driving pressure.
   Has marked respiratory acidosis that seems to be mostly related to high
   dead-space fraction.
   Will try to increase respiratory rate and watch for autoPEEP.
   Bradycardia
   Appears to be a junctional rhythm. Will replete all lytes including
   calcium, etc.
   Try to swap to Levophed for
   Acute renal failure
   Secondary to hemodynamics. Follow for now.
   Acidosis
   Mostly related to respiratory acidosis, although his bicarb has fallen
   over the past days as well.
   Since he has a lactic (and respiratory) acidosis, will hold off on
   bicarbonate for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently experiencing multiple organ failure of uncertain etiology, severe shock, and severe respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary embolism (PE) and sepsis. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, heparinization, and vasopressor support as needed. He also requires transfusion for ongoing bleeding, anemia, and relative hypovolemia. Esophageal-pressure-targeted ventilation has been initiated to manage his respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of cancer, recent surgery, immobility, and the presence of a right internal jugular deep vein thrombosis (RIJ DVT), there is a high suspicion for PE. Heparinization has been started empirically, and further diagnostic measures such as CT pulmonary angiography may be considered.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe shock and respiratory failure could be attributed to sepsis, which may be caused by a hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, covering MRSA, VRE, ESBL, and other resistant gram-negative rods.
3. Acute hepatitis: The patient's liver enzymes are significantly elevated, suggesting acute hepatitis. This could be due to ischemic or shock liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   50-year-old man with metastatic renal cell cancer s/p BMT now with
   multiple organ failure: respiratory failure, shock, acute renal
   failure, shock liver, thrombocytopenia and ?hemolysis.
   recrudescent severe shock
          Main differential here is pulmonary embolism (with
   pre-existing severe pulmonary parenchymal and vascular disease and RV
   dysfunction) and sepsis.
          Continue ABX as directed by ID
          Heparinize
          Keep CVP >12 (higher, if his oxygenation and ventilation
   will tolerate).  Vasopressor support as needed.
          Transfuse today given ongoing bleeding, anemia, and relative
   hypovolemia
   recrudescent severe respiratory failure with a very high dead space
   fraction
          Heparinze for suspected PE (+ RIJ DVT)
          Esophageal-pressure-targeted ventilation.  Keep
   transpulmonary pressure as low as possible while keeping pH > 7.20.  If
   TPP goes up and acidemic, would consider bicarbonate
   acute hepatitis (likely ischemic/shock liver)
          Review meds with ID and pharmacy to avoid hepatotoxicity
          Expect bilirubin to come up in next day or so.
   GI bleed
 suspect stress ulceration
          IV PPI twice a day
          Will try to keep heparinized for now, given high risk of
   death if RIJ clot embolized
   acute renal failure (likely ischemic, althoug postrenal is not fully
   excluded)
          Check renal ultrasound
          Check sediment and lytes
   acidosis
          Lactate has improved
          Respiratory component is limited both by high Vd/Vt and
   pulmonary compliance/transpulmonary pressures
   thrombocytopenia
          HIT seems unlikely given ongoing prior exposure
          TTP seems unlikely given timing
          DIC certainly possible
          Medications (ABX, ??IVIG) certainly possible
          Follow platelets again today.  If continues to fall, hold
   heparin.
          Will discuss with heme/onc and ID today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who is currently in refractory hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has significantly worsened overnight with profound respiratory acidosis. The family has decided to pursue comfort care after several meetings in the past 48 hours. The patient is sedated and lying in bed, with diminished breath sounds. 

The vital signs show a heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 68/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 79%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

The laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, elevated platelet count of 117 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated ALT and AST levels. The electrolyte levels show a slightly low potassium level of 24 mEq/L and low bicarbonate level of 5.1 mEq/L. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals a pH of 7.04, indicating acidosis. The partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is 52, which is significantly lower than the expected value for a patient on 100% FiO"
