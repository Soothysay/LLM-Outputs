   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. known to MICU service from 2 prior recent MICU transfers during
   present hospitalization.  Most recently transferred back to medical
   [**Hospital1 **] [**2104-12-12**].
   Currently returns for marked hypoxemia, malaise, significant cough
   (non-productive) and persistent respiratory distress.  Awakened this AM
   with malaise, fatigue but no chest pain.  ABG= 7.46/38/65.  Hypoxemia
   requred increased FIO2 by face mask with good effect.  Scheduled for
   repeat CT angio and transfer back to MICU service for additional
   evaluation and management.
   Upon arrival to MICU, states to feel improved.  Good SaO2 on NC.
   Noted to have new skin rash -- erythematous macular-papular rash over
   trunk/back.  Non-prurutic.
   Denies increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, chest pain, pleurisy.

   Imaging: CT angio with no evidence for PE.  However, interval
   development of multiple densities, LLL >> RLL and mid lung zones.
   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to new pneumonia on background of RSV
   infection.   No evidence for pulmonary embolism by today's CT scan.
   Evidence for new pulmonary infiltrates on right and left upper lobes
   --> possibly representing new infection or process (ex. PcP or other
   fungal infection), progression of underlying infection, complication of
   medications (ex. related to rash, related to antibody administration).
   Plan continue supplimental oxygen, monitor RR, maintain SaO2 > 90%,
   continue empirical antimicrobials.  Provide beta-agonist.  Check on
   next scheduled PcP prophylaxis Would check LE NIVS to assess for DVT.
   Check beta-galactomannan.  Consider bronchoscopy, although would
   require intubation to perform procedure safely.  Low threshold for
   intubation in event of clinical decline.
   PNEUMONIA (HAP) -- clinical variability on current regimen.  Doubt OI.
   Consider bronchoscopic investigation.  Continue current level of care.
   Interval development of multiple pulmonary infiltates  may represent
   aspiration or atuypical pneuonia, but may also represent process such
   as right-sided endovascular infeciton (ex. endocarditis, line-related
   infection).  Check blood cultures, consider repeat echo.
   RSV infection -- s/p antibody treatment.
   Cough -- attributed to RSV and HAP.  Improving.
   RASH -- new development;  appears drug-related, and currently receiving
   several potential offenders, including contrast dye (CT angio).
   CML s/p SCT c/b GVHD
 continue current level of care.
   GI GVHD -- continue oral swish and spit.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 encourage PO with suppliments.
   DEPRESSED MOOD -- consider pharmacological  intervention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of respiratory distress, known to have been in the MICU service multiple times during the present hospitalization. The patient presented with marked hypoxemia, malaise, significant cough, and persistent respiratory distress. The patient required increased FIO2 by face mask with good effect and is scheduled for repeat CT angio and transfer back to MICU service for additional evaluation and management.

Upon arrival to MICU, the patient reported feeling improved with good SaO2 on NC. A new skin rash was noted, described as an erythematous macular-papular rash over the trunk, non-pruritic. The patient denies increased cough, sputum, hemoptysis, chest pain, pleurisy, abdominal pain, back pain, or any other significant symptoms.

The patient's medical history, social history, review of systems, and physical examination findings are documented. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results are also recorded.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hypoxemia attributed to new pneumonia on a background of RSV infection. No evidence for pulmonary embolism was found on the CT scan. The presence of multiple densities in the left lower lobe and mid lung zones suggests new pulmonary infiltrates, possibly representing a new infection or process such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or other fungal infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with h/o CML s/p MRD allo-SCT c/b GVHD of skin/gut on
   immunosuppression presenting with RSV bronchiolitis c/b hospital
   acquired pneumonia, now with acute hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Appears to have been acute in onset, patient without any
   major complaints at the time.  ABG showing PaO2 of 65.  Differential
   includes PE, COPD exacerbation, worsening pneumonia or fungal
   infection, worsening bronchiolitis.  Also possible endovascular issue
   given indwelling line (Hickman) and multifocal pneumonia).Patient did
   have a CTA on [**12-5**] showing stable emphysema and no evidence of PE.
   Additionally, patient rapidly improved his oxygenation from requiring a
   NRB to maintaining sats in the mid-90s on 6L NC after receiving
   nebulizer treatments.  CXR wtihout any acute change from prior.
   Patient feels well except for ongoing cough
   - CTA now - prelim read: no e/o PE, but LLL infiltrate as well as new
   foci of infiltrate in LUL and RUL concerning for fungal or other
   organism.
   - Follow up final read CT
   - Continue ATC nebulizer treatment and prn albuterol
   - Continue to wean oxygen as needed
   - Continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/cefepime.  Also receiving
   posaconazole ppx, gets pentamidine as outpatient, will check date.
   Patient with no atypical coverage at this time, will discuss with ID as
   below.
   - Contact ID re: abx recommendations as patient is on broad spectrum
   and fungal coverage
   - Consider bronchoscopy for further characterization of infectious
   process, patient will likely need to be intubated for procedure.
   - Blood cultures with spikes, ECHO if cultures positive
   .
   # CML s/p transplant and GVHD: continue immunosuppression as per BMT
   team with prednisone, neoral and cellcept.  Picture not consistent with
   PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) 3160**]/galactomannan negative, and given posaconazole
   prophylaxis, unlikely aspergillus pneumonia.
   - Dexamethasone s/s for oral GVHD.
   - Continue current prophylactic agents with posaconazole and acyclovir.
   Received inhaled pentamidine as outpatient.
   - Continue ursodiol.
   .
   # Rash: Appears to be drug induced.  Unclear when rash began, though it
   appears to be new today.  Patient does not recall having had it prior,
   and nursing from BMT floor did not report it to nursing.  Cause
   includes drug-induced from cefepime (patient is allergic to pen VK -
   will clarify if reaction was a rash) though he has been on this
   multiple times in the past.  Also could be secondary to IV contrast
   though from CTA today as nursing does not think rash was present prior,
   though he has had IV contrast in the past as well.  No other apparent
   new drugs
   - Will continue to monitor
   - Symptomatic treatment if necessary including benadryl, H2 blocker,
   increase steroids
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: continue outpatient metoprolol XL. Unlikely that his
   hypoxia is related to ACS as it improved with nebulizers.  No
   PND/orthopnea or other signs of decompensated heart failure.
   - Check ECG now
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet, follow/replete electrolytes, continue standing
   magnesium repletion.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a myeloablativereplacement transplant (MRD allo-SCT) and is currently presenting with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and gut while being on immunosuppression. The patient was admitted to the hospital with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and subsequently developed hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is now experiencing acute hypoxia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 92/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%.

   55 yo M with h/o CML s/p MRD allo-SCT c/b GVHD of skin/gut on
   immunosuppression presenting with RSV bronchiolitis c/b hospital
   acquired pneumonia, now with acute hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improved since admission to the ICU, now on 6L NC.  Pt did
   not clearly improve after last admission so current presentation may be
   manifestation of prior RSV illness.  Chest CT with new foci of
   infiltrate in LUL and RUL although has been on broad-spectrum abx and
   antifungals.  PCP less likely given presentation although possible
   given prednisone use.
   - continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**2103-12-14**]) and Aztreonam (day #1 = [**2103-12-14**]);
   had received 7 days of Vanc/Cefepime prior to this.  Cipro started
   [**2103-12-14**] as well.
   - Continue ATC nebulizer treatment and prn albuterol
   - Continue to wean oxygen as needed
   - continue antifungals and acyclovir prophylaxis; was on pentamadine
   prior to admission for PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Consider bronchoscopy for further characterization of infectious
   process, patient will likely need to be intubated for procedure.
   - Blood cultures with spikes, ECHO if cultures positive
   .
   # CML s/p transplant and GVHD: continue immunosuppression as per BMT
   team with prednisone, neoral and cellcept.  Picture not consistent with
   PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) 3160**]/galactomannan negative, and given posaconazole
   prophylaxis, unlikely aspergillus pneumonia.  ? if this rash is
   manifestation of GVHD as well vs. drug rash.
   - Dexamethasone s/s for oral GVHD.
   - Continue current prophylactic agents with posaconazole and acyclovir.
   Received inhaled pentamidine as outpatient.
   - Continue ursodiol.
   - discuss with BMT team utility of high dose steroids for possible GVHD
   of lung or skin
   - possible IVIG today per BMT
   .
   # Rash: Appears to be drug induced.  Appears to be new today.  Patient
   does not recall having had it prior, and nursing from BMT floor did not
   report it to nursing.  Cause includes drug-induced from cefepime
   (patient is allergic to pen VK) though he has been on this multiple
   times in the past.  Also could be secondary to IV contrast though from
   CTA yesterday as nursing does not think rash was present prior, though
   he has had IV contrast in the past as well.  No other apparent new
   drugs.  Possible GVHD as well.
   - Will continue to monitor
   - Symptomatic treatment if necessary including benadryl, H2 blocker,
   increase steroids
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: continue outpatient metoprolol XL. Unlikely that his
   hypoxia is related to ACS as it improved with nebulizers.  No
   PND/orthopnea or other signs of decompensated heart failure.
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet, follow/replete electrolytes, continue standing
   magnesium repletion.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a matched unrelated donor (MUD) allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) and is currently presenting with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and gut while being on immunosuppression. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's hypoxia has improved since admission, but he still requires supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, but new foci of infiltrate in both lungs were found on a chest CT. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is less likely given the presentation, although possible due to prednisone use. The patient's blood cultures with spikes suggest bacterial infection, and an ECHO may be done if cultures are positive.

The patient has a history of CML post-transplant and GVHD. He continues to receive immunosuppression as per the bone marrow transplant (BMT) team with prednisone, neoral, and cellcept. The rash appears to be drug-induced, possibly from cefepime or IV contrast, but could also be secondary to GVHD. Monitoring will continue, and symptomatic treatment will be provided if necessary.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a stem cell transplant (SCT). He presented initially with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and respiratory distress. The patient was admitted to the ICU and received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). He was later readmitted with progressive hypoxemia and a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest computed tomography (CT). The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen, and his vital signs are within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Imaging studies reveal patchy ground glass opacities throughout all lobes and dense infiltrates at the bases of the lungs. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he has negative galactomannan and beta-D-glucan tests. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. HYPOXEMIA: Attributed to new pneumonia on the background of RSV infection. Differential diagnosis includes recurrent bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), fungal process, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Plan includes continuing supplemental oxygen, monitoring respiratory rate, maintaining oxygen saturation above 90%, and continuing empirical antimicrobials. Beta-agonist therapy is also provided, and a scheduled bronchoscopy is considered. Intubation is considered if there is a clinical decline.

   55 yo M with h/o CML s/p MRD allo-SCT c/b GVHD of skin/gut on
   immunosuppression presenting with RSV bronchiolitis c/b hospital
   acquired pneumonia, now with acute hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improved since admission to the ICU, now on 6L NC.  Pt did
   not clearly improve after last admission so current presentation may be
   manifestation of prior RSV illness.  Chest CT with new foci of
   infiltrate in LUL and RUL although has been on broad-spectrum abx and
   antifungals.  PCP less likely given presentation although possible
   given prednisone use.
   - continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**2103-12-14**]) and Aztreonam (day #1 = [**2103-12-14**]);
   had received 7 days of Vanc/Cefepime prior to this.  Cipro started
   [**2103-12-14**] as well.
   - Continue ATC nebulizer treatment and prn albuterol
   - Continue to wean oxygen as needed
   - continue antifungals and acyclovir prophylaxis; was on pentamadine
   prior to admission for PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Consider bronchoscopy for further characterization of infectious
   process, patient will likely need to be intubated for procedure.
   - Blood cultures with spikes, ECHO if cultures positive
   .
   # CML s/p transplant and GVHD: continue immunosuppression as per BMT
   team with prednisone, neoral and cellcept.  Picture not consistent with
   PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) 3160**]/galactomannan negative, and given posaconazole
   prophylaxis, unlikely aspergillus pneumonia.  ? if this rash is
   manifestation of GVHD as well vs. drug rash.
   - Dexamethasone s/s for oral GVHD.
   - Continue current prophylactic agents with posaconazole and acyclovir.
   Received inhaled pentamidine as outpatient.
   - Continue ursodiol.
   - discuss with BMT team utility of high dose steroids for possible GVHD
   of lung or skin
   - possible IVIG today per BMT
   .
   # Rash: Appears to be drug induced.  Appears to be new today.  Patient
   does not recall having had it prior, and nursing from BMT floor did not
   report it to nursing.  Cause includes drug-induced from cefepime
   (patient is allergic to pen VK) though he has been on this multiple
   times in the past.  Also could be secondary to IV contrast though from
   CTA yesterday as nursing does not think rash was present prior, though
   he has had IV contrast in the past as well.  No other apparent new
   drugs.  Possible GVHD as well.
   - Will continue to monitor
   - Symptomatic treatment if necessary including benadryl, H2 blocker,
   increase steroids
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: continue outpatient metoprolol XL. Unlikely that his
   hypoxia is related to ACS as it improved with nebulizers.  No
   PND/orthopnea or other signs of decompensated heart failure.
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet, follow/replete electrolytes, continue standing
   magnesium repletion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent a matched related donor (MRD) allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) and is currently presenting with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and gut. The patient also has respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is on immunosuppression and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antiviral prophylaxis. The patient's hypoxia has improved since admission to the ICU, but he is still requiring 6 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. There are new foci of infiltrate in both lungs on chest CT, despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is less likely given the presentation. The patient is allergic to penicillin VK and has a rash that appears to be drug-induced. The cause of the rash could be from cefepime or IV contrast. Possible GVHD of the skin is also a consideration. The patient's cardiomyopathy is unlikely to be related to acute hypoxia as it improved with nebulizers. There are no signs of decompensated heart failure. The patient is on outpatient metoprolol XL and will continue to follow/replete electrolytes, including magnesium repletion. The patient's daughter has been contacted for further communication. The patient requires ICU level of care pending possible bronchoscopy today and oxygen requirements."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a matched related donor (MRD) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and is presenting with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and gut while on immunosuppression. He also has respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia, and is currently experiencing acute hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 6 liters of nasal cannula. His neurological examination is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 29300/mm³, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Linezolid, Aztreonam, Cipro, and previously Vanc/Cefepime.

The patient's current plan includes continuing Linezolid and Aztreonam, as well as starting Cipro. A repeat chest X-ray will be performed in the morning to assess the progress of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of PNA, RSV Bronchiolitis, and hypoxia. The patient has been receiving various treatments including IVIG, antibiotics, and other medications for their conditions. However, the patient has developed a rash that is spreading despite stopping cefepime and continues to have low oxygen levels. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/54 mmHg to 118/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and a SpO2 level of 93%. The patient's WBC count has decreased significantly. They are currently on multiple medications including nebs q6, prednisone, hep SQ, dexamethasone swish and spit, MVI, Mag OX, Vit D, CaCO3, Vit C, Ursadiol, Omeprazole, Cellcept, Folic A, Posiconizole, Cyclosporin, and Acyclovir.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's hypoxemia is attributed to a new pneumonia on the background of RSV infection. This suggests the possibility of a healthcare-associated infection, which can be caused by bacteria acquired in the hospital setting.
2. Drug-related rash: The patient's rash appears to be drug-related, possibly due to contrast dye and cefepime."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions and complications. The chief complaint is PNA (presumably pneumonia), RSV bronchiolitis, and hypoxia. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including IV immunoglobulin (IV IG), antibiotics, and respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 96 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 99/54 mmHg to 118/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications through IV infusions and oral administration.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular sounds, distant heart sounds, diminished breath sounds throughout the chest, absent peripheral pulses in both extremities, and a diffuse maculopapular rash that is more confluent today. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate potential electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and plan include hypoxemia attributed to new pneumonia on the background of RSV infection, encouraging ambulation, deferring bronchoscopic evaluation for now, and completing an 8-day course of antibiotics"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with h/o CML s/p MRD allo-SCT c/b GVHD of skin/gut on
   immunosuppression presenting with RSV bronchiolitis c/b hospital
   acquired pneumonia, transferred to the ICU with acute hypoxia now
   improved.
   # Hypoxia: Improved since admission to the ICU, now on 3L NC. Pt has
   been afebrile and his leukocytosis appears to be improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen. Will defer from bronchoscopy given his
   improvement in clinical status on his current antibiotics.
    - continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**2103-12-14**]), Aztreonam (day #1 = [**2103-12-14**]),
   cipro (day #1 [**12-14**]), and flagyl (day #1 [**12-16**]) ; had received 7 days of
   Vanc/Cefepime prior to this.   Will need an 8 day course from [**12-14**].
   - Continue ATC nebulizer treatment and prn albuterol
   - Continue to wean oxygen as needed
   - continue antifungals and acyclovir prophylaxis; was on pentamadine
   prior to admission for PCP prophylaxis
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 229**] cultures with spikes, ECHO if cultures positive
   # Tachycardia: Patient has been in sinus tach on tele in the 90
s to
   100
s.  Is on 150 mg Toprol daily as an outpatient which has been held
   here.  Does not appear to be in pain, oxygenation is improving (no
   evidence of PE), and he appears to be euvolemic.
   - Start metoprolol 50 mg po bid.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # CML s/p transplant and GVHD: Pt received IVIG recently per heme/onc
   recommendations.  No additional recs noted this morning with continue
   current immunosuppression regimen.
   - Dexamethasone s/s for oral GVHD.
   - Continue current prophylactic agents with posaconazole and acyclovir.
   Received inhaled pentamidine as outpatient.
   - Continue ursodiol.
   # Rash: His rash is improving.  Was thought to be drug induced, may be
   related to Cefepime as he does have an allergy history to PCN V however
   he has received Cefepime in the past without any reactions.  Possible
   GVHD as well.
   - Will continue to monitor
   - Symptomatic treatment if necessary including benadryl, H2 blocker,
   increase steroids
   # Cardiomyopathy. Unlikely that his hypoxia is related to ACS as it
   improved with nebulizers.  No PND/orthopnea or other signs of
   decompensated heart failure.
   - Restart metoprolol as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a matched unrelated donor (MUD) allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) and is presenting with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and gut while being on immunosuppression. He was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxia secondary to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

The patient has shown improvement since admission to the ICU, now only requiring 3 liters of oxygen through a nasal cannula. He has been afebrile, and his leukocytosis appears to be improving on his current antibiotic regimen. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: Although the patient's hypoxia has improved, there is still a risk of further deterioration due to the underlying respiratory issues and potential infections.

2. Infection: Despite the improvement, the patient is still at risk of developing new infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.

3. GVHD: The patient has a history of GVHD, and although his skin rash is improving, there is still a risk of ongoing or worsening GVHD affecting other organs.

4. Cardiomyopathy: Although the hypoxia improvement suggests that acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is unlikely, the patient's history"

   # Hypoxia: Improved since admission to the ICU, now on 6L NC.  Pt did
   not clearly improve after last admission so current presentation may be
   manifestation of prior RSV illness.  Portable chest x-ray performed
   yesterday showed pneumonia to be resolving. Pt has been afebrile and
   his leukocytosis appears to be improving on his current antibiotic
   regimen. Will defer from bronchoscopy given his current improvement in

   (patient is allergic to pen VK) though he has been on this multiple
   times in the past.  Also could be secondary to IV contrast though from
   CTA yesterday as nursing does not think rash was present prior, though
   he has had IV contrast in the past as well.  No other apparent new

","The patient is a 78-inch tall and 76 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a background of RSV infection, clinically resolving. The patient has been diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia, which is likely bacterial in nature, and is expected to complete an 8-day course of antibiotics through 12/21. The patient also has a rash that appears drug-related and is receiving several potential offenders, including contrast dye and cefepime.

The patient underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is at risk for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient is currently on immunosuppressive therapy and may require intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) therapy and modification of the steroid regimen. Monitoring cyclosporine levels may be necessary.

The patient also has gastrointestinal GVHD and is advised to continue oral swish and spit. Nutritional support is encouraged, including encouraging oral intake with supplements. The patient's depressed mood warrants consideration of pharmacological intervention.

In terms of ICU care, glycemic control is well maintained. The patient has a tunneled (Hickman) line placed on 12/14 at 10:58 AM. Prophylaxis is provided for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and stress ulcers with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis is also"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-inch tall and 76 kg individual in the ICU with a history of RSV infection, nosocomial pneumonia, CML post-splenectomy, rash, and depression.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (linezolid, aztreonam, metronidazole), antivirals (acyclovir), heparin (prophylaxis), omeprazole, atrovent, albuterol, prednisone, MVI, CaHCO3, ursodiol, Cellcept, folate, posaconazole, and cyclosporine.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/66 to 121/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the resolution of the maculopapular rash.
- The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral lung bases, a resolving maculopapular rash, and no other significant findings.
- Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, Hct, and Plt, along with decreased Cr, glucose levels within normal range, and abnormal PT/PTT/INR levels.
- Imaging reveals subtle patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray,"
