   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of pyelonephritis and bacteremia who was recently discharged after completing a course of ciprofloxacin. She presented to the hospital with respiratory distress and was found to be gaining significant weight during an outpatient appointment. Her symptoms include shortness of breath, fevers, and chest pain. In the emergency room, her blood pressure was 147/92 mmHg, heart rate was 44 beats per minute, and she required 100% NRB then BIPAP due to hypoxemia. She also had a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infections, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and renal transplantation with subsequent renal insufficiency. She has no known drug allergies. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for weight gain, tachypnea, and constitutional symptoms.

On the flow sheet, her vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 170/42-76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 74 mL, total output of 1,785 mL, urine output of 1,285 mL, and a negative balance of -1,711 mL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of pyelonephritis, bacteremia, renal transplant, renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She was admitted for respiratory distress, hypoxemia, weight gain, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, hypertension, and bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest X-ray. These findings suggest pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure (CHF) likely caused by dietary indiscretion and diastolic dysfunction in the setting of hypertension and renal insufficiency. The patient is currently receiving diuretics, nitroglycerin, and non-invasive positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support. Her blood pressure is being controlled, and she is undergoing weaning off NTG and BIPAP as tolerated.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, elevated BNP levels, and bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest pulmonary edema. This condition occurs when fluid accumulates in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms, including weight gain and elevated BNP levels, along with the presence of bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest X-ray, are consistent with CHF. CHF is a chronic condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
3. Renal Insufficiency"

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-corticosteroid therapy, and acute onset dyspnea. She presents with symptoms of pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, and hypertensive urgency. The patient is currently on various medications including lopressor, nifedipine, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), diuril, lasix, and bipap support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's acute onset of dyspnea is likely due to pulmonary edema and peripheral edema. It is essential to continue treatment for hypertensive urgency, manage diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and optimize blood pressure control.
2. Nosocomial Pneumonia (NPNA): The patient has leukocytosis and an infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating possible nosocomial pneumonia. Treatment with vancomycin and Zosyn is recommended, along with monitoring vancomycin levels.
3. Renal Issues: As the patient has ESRD post renal transplant, it is crucial to monitor renal function, adjust immunosuppressants (such as cyclosporine), and ensure appropriate follow-up with the renal transplant service.
4. Type 1 Diabetes: The patient's diabetes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-corrected renal transplant, and obesity. She presented with acute onset of dyspnea, bilateral rales in the lungs, pitting edema, and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The initial assessment suggests flash pulmonary edema with hypertensive urgency and component of congestive heart failure (CHF)/volume overload. The patient's blood pressure has now normalized after nitroglycerin (NTG) infusion, but she remains dyspneic. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea may be attributed to flash pulmonary edema, hypertensive urgency, and CHF/volume overload. It is important to closely monitor her respiratory status and provide appropriate respiratory support if necessary.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may be due to dietary indiscretions. She has already received IV diuretics (diuril and lasix), but her urine output is still low. Further interventions may include continuing diuretics, considering urgent hemodialysis (HD), and implementing fluid restriction once she tolerates oral intake.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count. This could indicate an ongoing infection, especially considering her recent fever at home"

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EDEMA
 Respiratroy distress, hypoxemia - weight gain, BNP, HTN and CXR
   suggest pulmonary edema/CHF likely due to dietary indiscretion and
   diastolic dysfunction in setting of HTN and renal insufficiency. Will
   continue to diurese with diuril and lasix when UO < 150, off NTG, off
   BIPAP. Check daily wt, fluid restriction. Afterolad reduction with
   nifedepine (maximize prior to adding another [**Doctor Last Name **]), metoprolol
   Leukocytosis improved, low grade fever, infiltrates - suspect pulmonary
   edema though will pursue micro w/u and cover for pneumonia with abx for
   now, all cxs pend, viral swab pending. f/u vanc level.
   renal transplant, renal insufficiency - check CSA level, continue
   immunosuppression, hold sodium bicarb

    MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
","Summary:
The patient presents with dyspnea and respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema. The patient was weaned off nitro gtt and bipap overnight intermittently. Diuresis with diuril and lasix has been effective, with a weight loss of 2.8 L. The patient is currently on a BiPAP mask. The patient's history, allergies, and last dose of antibiotics are noted. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and normal respiratory rate. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1963 mL and -1354 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received various medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems and flow sheet data are unchanged from admission, except where noted. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Imaging shows improved renal indices and chest X-ray findings. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress, hypoxemia, weight gain, and findings on chest X-ray suggest pulmonary edema. This condition can worsen if fluid accumulation continues or if there is inadequate diuresis.
2. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and recent renal transplant. She presents with acute onset dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. She has pulmonary edema and peripheral edema, as well as diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). Her current medications include lopressor, nifedipine, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, pantoprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, and various immunosuppressants. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, and infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a nosocomial pneumonia. She also has elevated creatinine levels and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and peripheral edema suggest an exacerbation of diastolic CHF. If left untreated, this condition can lead to further fluid accumulation in the lungs and other organs, potentially resulting in respiratory distress and organ dysfunction.

2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The presence of leukocytosis, infiltrate on chest X-ray, and positive cultures indicates a nosocomial pneumonia. If not appropriately treated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent urinary tract infections, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a renal transplant, who presented with acute onset dyspnea. She has pulmonary edema and peripheral edema, which indicates diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's blood pressure is elevated, so she will continue to be treated for hypertension urgency. She also has nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia) and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient has received diuretics to manage fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic CHF: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and peripheral edema suggest diastolic CHF. This condition can worsen if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypertension Urgency: The patient's elevated blood pressure requires ongoing management to prevent further complications.
3. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia while in the hospital. If not treated effectively, this infection can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially spread to other parts of the body.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient has been receiving diuretics to address fluid overload. If the diuretic therapy is not effective or if fluid intake exceeds output, the patient may develop worsening edema and pulmonary congestion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) on tetracycline immunosuppression, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post (s/p) continuous renal therapy (CRT) in [**2149**]. She presents with acute onset of dyspnea. The patient has pulmonary edema and peripheral edema, hypertensive urgency, and requires ongoing oxygen support. She is also diagnosed with a nosocomial pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is experiencing dyspnea and has bilateral rales to mid lung bilaterally, worse on the right side. This indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing.
2. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure is high at 148/45 mmHg, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. Immediate management is required to lower blood pressure and prevent further complications.
3. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient has developed a hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is an infection acquired during hospitalization. The presence of fever and increased white blood cell count suggests a bacterial infection. Treatment with vancomycin and Zosyn is initiated to cover for possible resistant organisms.
4. ESRD s/p Renal Transplant: The patient has a history of E"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is experiencing respiratory distress and pulmonary edema.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and renal transplant.
- Patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, with readings ranging from 148/48 to 159/90 mmHg.
- Heart rate is within normal range (66 bpm).
- Respiratory rate is slightly elevated (20-34 breaths per minute).
- Oxygen saturation is at 94% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient has edema in both lower extremities.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and lactate dehydrogenase.
- The patient's glucose levels are elevated.
- Microbiology tests indicate a negative viral screen.
- The patient's condition has improved with diuresis but requires slow diuresis due to mild hypotension.
- Potential complications include leukocytosis, hypertension, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, rising creatinine levels, and potential adjustment of immune suppressants in the context of a renal transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
2. Hypertension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure readings suggest uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to organ damage.
3. Dyspnea: The patient's respiratory distress and crackles in the lungs indicate possible pulmonary edema, which can result in reduced oxygenation and respiratory failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has received various treatments, including diuretics for fluid overload and antibiotics for an infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-148/37-50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 4L of oxygen. The patient's weight is 122.7 kg, with a fluid balance showing an intake of 1615 mL and output of 1350 mL since 12 AM. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, blood glucose, and leukocytes. The patient's medication regimen includes furosemide, heparin sodium, and antibiotics. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and the presence of pulmonary edema on imaging suggest a possible complication related to fluid overload.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and ongoing use of antibiotics indicate a potential ongoing infection.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent urinary tract infections, immunosuppression, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a renal transplant in [**2149**]. She presents with acute onset dyspnea, pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, and hypertensive urgency. The patient has been receiving diuretics, antibiotics, and other medications as needed. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/43 to 66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated potassium levels, creatinine levels increasing from 2.2 to 3.3, and blood glucose levels fluctuating between 119 and 182 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible AKI, which can be a result of her underlying renal disease or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
2. Hyperkalemia: The elevated potassium levels may pose a risk for cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has been diuresed and has improved somewhat. Her creatinine is now
   rising and she has a persistent RLL infiltrate most compatible with
   pneumonia. She is on antibiotics and I suspect will be slow to fully
   recover in light of her immunosuppression. Will hold off on further
   diuresis because of her rising creatinine and continue antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent UTI on tetracycline immunosuppression, and ESRD who presents with acute onset dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, leukocytosis, and hypertension. Her current condition shows improvement with diuresis but needs slow diuresis due to worsening creatinine levels. She is receiving diuretics, antibiotics, and other medications. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there are concerns about gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular complications, and diabetes management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating a decline in renal function. This could lead to further fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Pneumonia: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient has persistent RLL infiltrate on the chest X-ray, suggesting ongoing or unresolved pneumonia. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and increased risk of secondary infections.
3. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has new RUQ pain, and there are concerns about possible hepatic involvement. Monitoring liver function tests and considering an RUQ ultrasound would be important to identify any hepatic complications.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has hypertension and a history of type 1 diabetes, both of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Monitoring blood pressure and considering an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function would"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) on tetracycline immunosuppression, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with acute onset of dyspnea. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is indicated by the need for supplemental oxygen (6L O2 currently) and the presence of pulmonary edema.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has pulmonary edema, which is evident from the crackles in their chest and the bilateral fluffy infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, with blood pressure readings ranging from 130/52 mmHg to 148/52 mmHg. This condition requires management to prevent further complications.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 24.3 K/uL. This may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine levels have been progressively increasing, from 2.2 mg/dL to 3.6 mg/dL, indicating worsening kidney function. This could be due to the underlying ESRD or acute kidney injury.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been consistently high, ranging from 178 mg/dL to 182 mg/dL. This indicates poor glycemic control and the need for insulin management.

7. Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) Pain: The patient is experiencing new RUQ pain, which could be related to hepatic or biliary issues. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

8. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, indicating anemia. The cause of anemia needs to be identified and managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the current conditions include worsening respiratory failure, progressive kidney injury, uncontrolled hypertension, infections, and further complications related to diabetes management. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-corrected renal transplant, and obesity. She presents with acute onset dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and peripheral edema. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and bibasilar rales suggest pulmonary edema. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side (114/75 mmHg). If her blood pressure drops further, it can result in inadequate organ perfusion and hypotensive shock.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has a history of ESRD and is on immunosuppressants post-renal transplant. Any additional renal insult could lead to further deterioration of renal function.
4. Diabetic Complications: As a type 1 diabetic, the patient is at risk for diabetic complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or diabetic ketoencephalopathy. Close monitoring of glucose levels is essential.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs and is currently on antibiotics for a nosocomial pneumonia. Infections"

   She has been diuresed and has improved from a resp standpoint but has
   had sig increase in her Cr.
    Now allowing to autoregulate and would run even to 500 cc +.
   RLL infiltrate most compatible with pneumonia.
   She is on antibiotics and likely to beslow to fully recover in light of
   her immunosuppression.
