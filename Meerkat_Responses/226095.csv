","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with pericardial effusion of unknown etiology, acute cholecystitis, a history of seizure, hypertension, no coronary artery disease, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient underwent pericardiocentesis this morning and is currently being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate between 99-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/91 to 124/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and in sinus rhythm.

The physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention, heart sounds are normal, and there are no murmurs, gallops, or pericardial rub. There is mild diffuse abdominal tenderness and right-sided lower extremity edema. No other significant abnormalities were noted during the examination.

Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and lipase levels. The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for the cholecystitis and is being monitored for any changes in her condition.

The assessment and plan include monitoring the patient's hemodynamics, pulsus paradoxus, and telemetry. She will undergo further analysis of the pericardial fluid, including tests for total protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose,"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9428**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   44 yr old woman transferred with cholecystitis because of finding of
   large pericardial effusion found on CT
   Evidence of tamponade on echo with pulsus 15-30 and mild tachycardia
   without hypotension
   730 cc of pericardial fluid drained today
   Physical Examination
   mild epigastric discomfort
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue antibiotics for cholecystitis with surgery followup.
   Pericardial drain out tomorrow with studies pending and repeat echo in
   AM
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 391**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4943**], MD
   on:[**2141-8-17**] 12:27 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a chief complaint of none. The patient has undergone pericardiocentesis and was found to have a large pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade physiology. The etiology of the pericardial effusion is unclear, and differential diagnoses include viral pericarditis, idiopathic, malignancy-associated, autoimmune, hypothyroidism, or other infections such as tuberculosis or HIV.

The patient also has a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, as confirmed by RUQ ultrasound. She presented with epigastric pain and bloating, and slight transaminitis with normal biliary levels and elevated lipase.

Additionally, the patient has a history of seizure, hypertension, hypercoagulable state (IVC filter due to DVT), and PCOS. She is currently on IVF to optimize cardiac output and avoid right ventricular collapse. Fluid from the pericardiocentesis will be analyzed for various parameters.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 134/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her physical examination reveals mild diffuse tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and mild peripheral edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female who is currently admitted to the ICU with pericardial effusion of unknown etiology, as well as acute cholecystitis. The patient has evidence of tamponade physiology on echocardiogram and pulsus paradoxus. 

The plan for the patient includes pericardiocentesis in the morning, followed by an echo tomorrow. The fluid from the pericardiocentesis will be analyzed for TP, LDH, glucose, cell count, gram stain, cx, and cytology. The patient's hemodynamics will be monitored, and they will be placed on telemetry. Intravenous fluids will be given to optimize cardiac output and avoid right ventricular collapse. 

Additionally, the patient's TSH levels will be followed up, and a workup for other causes of pericardial effusion such as autoimmune disease will be considered. Age-appropriate malignancy screening will also be done as an outpatient.

The patient's acute cholecystitis will be managed with conservative treatment initially, including antibiotics. The decision for further intervention, such as cholecystectomy or percutaneous drainage, will depend on the patient's condition after the pericardiocentesis. 

The patient's history of seizure was noted, and Dilantin levels were found to be low. Therefore, the patient has been restarted on Dilantin.

Regarding the patient's hypertension, she is unsure if she was taking HCTZ at"

The lungs are clear without wheezes or crackles. There is mild diffuse tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and mild diffuse peripheral edema, more pronounced on the right side. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16,500 cells/microliter, with 92% ""other"" cells of uncertain significance. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient has an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 297 IU/L and abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 3.2.

The patient is currently receiving IV Unasyn for an additional three days, then switching to oral antibiotics. Phenytoin levels were low"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with pericardial effusion of unknown etiology, acute cholecystitis, and a history of seizures. She is currently in the ICU and is hemodynamically stable. The plan includes pericardiocentesis, analysis of the fluid, monitoring of hemodynamics, and consideration of other causes of pericardial effusion. She will also be monitored for acute cholecystitis and may require intervention such as cholecystectomy or percutaneous drain. The patient's dilantin level was low, so it has been restarted. She has a history of hypertension, but is normotensive since admission. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and received an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's pain management will be evaluated post-procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient has a large pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade physiology. If left untreated, this can lead to cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac compresses the heart and impairs its ability to pump effectively.
2. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for both the pericardial effusion and acute cholecystitis. If the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are ineffective, it could result in a more"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with multiple medical conditions and complications. The note summarizes her current health status in the ICU, including ongoing treatment for pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade physiology, acute cholecystitis, and a history of seizure. 

The patient has been diagnosed with a pericardial effusion of unknown etiology, which has resulted in tamponade physiology. A significant amount of fluid was drained from the pericardial cavity, and percytology revealed malignancy-associated effusion. Further analysis of the fluid showed 9490 white blood cells with 92% highly atypical lymphocytes, suggesting a lymphoproliferative process. 

The patient is also being treated for acute cholecystitis, with conservative management including antibiotics and monitoring. There is a recommendation for possible cholecystectomy in the future. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of seizure, for which she is on Dilantin. Her Dilantin level was low at 6.8, and she will be monitored, with plans to adjust the medication dose accordingly. 

Other notable medical history includes hypertension, which is currently well-controlled, and no known coronary artery disease. The patient has received an IVC filter due to a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and inability to anticoagulate. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving appropriate nutrition, glycemic"

   Additional comments:
   likely lymphoma by cell type - fluid from pericardial drainage
   repeat echo today does not show significant reaccumulation
   Chest CT shows invaginating lesion associted with the lateral RA/RV
   wall - lobulated in nature
   In discussion with the oncology service this remains most consistent
   with a primary cardiac lymphoma - and priority is transfer for the
   initiation of chemotherapy
   i would favor an MRI monday( [**2141-8-21**]) to follow the size of this mass
   with chemotherapy
   Question of cholecystitis remains though does not seem to be an active
   issue at present

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The note highlights several key points:

1. The patient has a pericardial effusion of unknown etiology, with 730 cc of drained exudate fluid from the pericardial cavity. The fluid is suspected to be malignancy-associated, with 9490 white blood cells (WBC) and 92% highly atypical lymphocytes, which are suspicious for a lymphoproliferative process.

2. The patient is diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, as evidenced by RUQ ultrasound findings and slightly elevated liver enzymes (transaminitis). The patient is currently being managed conservatively with antibiotics and is being followed up for possible need for cholecystectomy.

3. The patient has a history of seizure and is on Dilation therapy. Her Dilation level is low at 6.8, and she is being monitored for serum Dilation level. If the level remains low, the afternoon dose of Dilation will be increased to 200mg.

4. The patient has hypertension and is on HCTZ medication.

5. The patient has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and does not currently exhibit symptoms of ischemic heart disease. However, the patient's rhythm is non-sinus rhythm (NSR), and she is being monitored on telemetry.

6. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

","Summary:
The patient presented with epigastric pain and was found to have a pericardial effusion, which was drained on 8/18/2141. The CT thorax showed a soft tissue density/lobulated lesion near the tricuspid valve, requiring further evaluation with TTE or TEE. The patient was diagnosed with lymphoma and is being transferred to BMT 669 for further treatment. They were started on Allopurinol in preparation for onc treatments and had DIC and tumor lysis labs sent off. A CT thorax and neck with contrast was performed for lymphadenopathy. Gen [Doctor First Name] recommended augmentin or cipro/flagyl for 2 weeks, followed by an interval cholecystectomy within 2 weeks. The patient has allergies to aspirin, and their last doses of antibiotics were ampicillin on 8/18/2141 at 01:00 AM and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) on 8/19/2141 at 02:10 AM. The patient is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium, and other medications include augmentin, cipro/flagyl, and allopurinol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the new diagnosis of lymphoma. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 115/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,886 mL, output of 2,350 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 465 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but is not on supplemental oxygen. The patient's peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. The patient's skin, neurologic examination, and other physical exam findings are not assessed. Laboratory results show a WBC count of 9.6 K/uL, Hct of 36.2%, Plt of 286 K/uL, Cr of 0.5 mg/dL, Glucose of 96 mg/dL, and other labs within normal ranges. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to BMT 669.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion, which could potentially lead to cardiac tamponade if the effusion continues to accumulate and exerts pressure on the heart.
2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection that needs to be monitored and treated.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acalculous cholecystitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, gallbladder wall thickening"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a chief complaint of epigastric pain. She has been diagnosed with pericardial effusion of unknown etiology, along with acute cholecystitis. The pericardial fluid analysis showed highly atypical lymphocytes, suggesting a possible lymphoproliferative process. The patient is currently on various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, Unasyn IV antibiotics, and allopurinol. She is also being monitored for her hemodynamics and on telemetry. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac tamponade: Due to the presence of a large pericardial effusion, there is a risk of cardiac tamponade, which can lead to impaired filling of the heart chambers and reduced cardiac output.
2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for both pericardial effusion and acute cholecystitis. There is a possibility of developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea or other infections due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of DVT and received an IVC filter. There is a risk of recurrent thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
4. Seizure recurrence: Although the patient's dilantin level was low, she had a previous history of seizure. There is a chance of seizure recurrence"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with pericardial effusion of unknown etiology, acute cholecystitis, and a history of seizure. She has been diagnosed with a malignancy-associated pericardial fluid involvement by kappa light chain-restricted CD10-positive monotypic B-cell lymphoproliferative process. The patient's symptoms suggest chronic pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, which was relieved after draining 730 cc of exudate fluid from the pericardial cavity. The fluid analysis showed malignancy-associated effusion with 9490 white blood cells (WBCs), and 92% of the WBCs were highly atypical lymphocytes suspicious of a lymphoproliferative process.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable vital signs with a heart rate (HR) of 77 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 112/80 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95% on room air. She is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has an IVC filter in place due to a history of DVT. Her neurological examination is normal with no focal deficits.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count (287 K/uL), hemoglobin (12.3 g/dL), creatinine (0.5 mg/dL),"
