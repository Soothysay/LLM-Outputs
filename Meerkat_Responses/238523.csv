","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have ethylene glycol toxicity, resulting in anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity. The patient underwent hemodialysis and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH), which resolved the acidosis and decreased the anion gap.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Acid/base disturbance: Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity due to ethylene glycol toxicity, now resolved.
2. Altered mental status: Initially due to ethylene glycol toxicity, now sedated for mechanical ventilation.
3. Hyperkalemia: Corrected with hemodialysis and correction of academia.
4. Acute renal failure: With normal BUN suggestive of intrinsic renal disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity.
5. Fall: Currently on a hard collar, CT head at OSH without significant abnormalities.
6. Atrial fibrillation: Unclear etiology, resolved with sedation, HD, and hydration.
7. Elevated lactate: Falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol toxicity, needs further evaluation for infection.
8. Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate: No bandemia, CXR shows LUL infiltrate, other workup as above.

1. Pneumonia: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse.
- He presented with altered mental status and was found to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity, consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.
- The patient underwent hemodialysis and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to renal failure secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity.
- His mental status has improved, but he remains agitated and not fully responsive.
- The patient also has atrial fibrillation, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, and a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.
- He has a history of cocaine abuse and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethylene glycol toxicity: The patient initially presented with altered mental status and anion gap metabolic acidosis, which are consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. He has been treated with bicarb, fomepizole, hemodialysis, and CVVH. However, there is still a risk of ongoing toxicity, especially if ethylene glycol levels are not adequately monitored and treated.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated BUN and creatinine levels. This is likely secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. The patient will require ongoing nephrology management and may require further dialysis treatments.

3. Hyperkalemia:"

   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely due to antifreeze (ethylene
   glycol toxicity).  Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did
   not show any acute changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight
   - ethylene glycol level is 314, resend the levels post dialysis (send
   to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**])
   - need to recheck lytes (gap) and pH post dialysis and give bicarb as
   needed
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 50 mg IV q4h and pyridoxine 50 mg
   q6h for 24 hours
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during dialysis.
   - IVF with bicarb
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:  Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased
   osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.  anion gap
   around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene glycol.
   - Bicarb with IVF
   - Hemodialysis
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K is 6 with tented T waves.
   - calcium, insulin given
   - hemodialysis
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - hemodialysis
   - IV hydration
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - image once he is stable.
   - continue hard collar for now.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rapid ventricular response.
   - IVF
   - no BB given recent coccaine use
   - will hold off on CCB for now given this is probably phsyilogic
   response to keep his CO adequate
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - send BCx
   - UA and UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - will check CK.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have ethylene glycol toxicity in his system, as evidenced by elevated levels and the presence of oxalate crystals in his urine. The patient also has an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity, indicating ethylene glycol toxicity. Other findings include hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's condition requires immediate attention and management of various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if not managed appropriately with hemodialysis and careful fluid management.
2. Seizures: Ethylene glycol toxicity can lead to seizures due to the disruption of electrolyte balance and brain function. Close monitoring and appropriate anticonvulsant therapy may be required.
3. Metabolic disturbances: The patient's altered mental status and acid-base disturbances need to be corrected promptly to prevent further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or organ dysfunction.
4. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and LUL infiltrate suggests a possible infection, which needs to be evaluated and treated promptly to prevent the progression of the infection and associated complications.

   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status.
2. The patient has a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse.
3. Ethylene glycol toxicity was suspected, leading to acid-base disturbance and subsequent treatment with bicarbonate and fomepizole.
4. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to remove ethylene glycol and correct acid-base imbalance.
5. The patient's altered mental status is now attributed to mechanical ventilation and sedation.
6. Urine analysis showed oxalate crystals, and a CT scan of the head did not reveal any acute changes.
7. The patient's serum potassium level was elevated at 6.0 me/L, which improved with HD and correction of academia.
8. Acute renal failure developed, with an increase in creatinine from 1.8 to 2.5 this morning, likely secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity.
9. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, possibly due to physiological stress or cocaine use.
10. Elevated lactate levels could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol toxicity, but infection needs to be ruled out, especially with an elevated white blood cell count and LUL infiltrate on chest X-ray.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. The patient was treated with bicarbonate and fomepizole due to continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). The anion gap has improved, and acidosis has resolved after hemodialysis (HD) and CVVH. Oxalate crystals were found in the urine.

The patient also has altered mental status likely initially due to ethylene glycol toxicity and now sedated overnight for mechanical ventilation. He has a history of a fall, for which he is currently wearing a hard collar, and a CT scan of the head showed no acute changes. A lumbar puncture was within normal limits.

The patient has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6, which improved with HD and correction of acidemia. He has acute renal failure with a creatinine level in the low 3s, suggestive of intrinsic renal disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. He received intravenous fluids yesterday with lasix 120mg IV, resulting in only 50 cc urine output.

The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation, possibly due to cocaine use, and his rapid ventricular response resolved overnight with sedation, HD, and hydration"

   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse who presented with altered mental status. He was found to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to treat the toxicity. His acidosis resolved after treatment, and his anion gap decreased.

The patient also has hyperkalemia, acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, a fall resulting in a cervical collar placement, atrial fibrillation, elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and a history of cocaine abuse and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethylene glycol toxicity leading to metabolic acidosis and renal failure.
2. Hyperkalemia due to acute renal failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
4. Elevated lactate levels, which could indicate tissue hypoperfusion or infection.
5. Left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia or aspiration.
6. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding from the nasogastric tube.
7. History of cocaine abuse, which can cause cardiovascular complications.
8. Depression and previous suicidal ideation, indicating a need for psychiatric evaluation and management."

   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  anion gap  around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene
   glycol. Treated w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of  CVVH. Anion gap to 12
   this morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.  Osmolar gap
   closed
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   - Replete Ca, Mg aggressively
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line in placd and patient will  continue to receive CVVH
   until EG cleared. [**Month (only) 11**] need HD afterward if UO does not restart
   - ethylene glycol level on presentation 314, trending levels [**Hospital1 **] to TID
   (send to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**]). [**11-28**] 3am level was 32.
   -q6h  lytes while on CVVH
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 1mg daily and pyridoxine 100mg
   daily
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during CVVH
   -continue propofol, weaning as tolerated, titrate for agitation.
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K of 6 with tented T waves on presentation. K improved
   w/HD and correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr stable in low 3s.
   Nephrology following. Given IVF yesterday with lasix 120mg IV with only
   50 cc UO.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue CVVH with goal to remove 1L negative today
   - q6h electrolytes check
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switched collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - returned to NSR [**11-27**] to [**11-28**]
   - echo: [**11-27**], Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function. No structural valvular disease.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Elevated lactate Could be falsely elevated due to
   ethylene glycol toxicity, lactate level now normal.  However given
   elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out infection.  LP unremarkable as
   above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration to
   complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - CK now normal at 155.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase
   .
   #UGI bleeding: blood from NG tube before patient self-d/c.  None since
   first day of admission
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG was placed
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, when has BM and concern for ileus resolves get
   nutrition consult for TF

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity, consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. He has been treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, hemodialysis (HD), and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). His acidosis has resolved after treatment.

The patient also has hyperkalemia, which improved with HD and correction of academia. He has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, suggestive of intrinsic renal disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. He is being followed by nephrology and is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient sustained a fall and is currently on a hard collar. He had a CT head at OSH without significant abnormalities and poor quality neck films. He is being switched to a collar from Location (un) 239-J until he can be clinically cleared.

The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with an unclear etiology. His rapid ventricular response has resolved throughout the night with sedation, HD, and hydration. His beta-blocker has been held due to recent cocaine use, and he is not currently on a calcium channel blocker.

There is an elevated lactate level, which could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol toxicity. However, given his elevated white blood cell count"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse presenting with altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with ethylene glycol toxicity, which has led to an anion gap metabolic acidosis and increased osmolarity. The patient has received bicarbonate, fomepizole, hemodialysis (HD), and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to treat the toxicity.

The patient also has hyperkalemia, acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, atrial fibrillation, elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. There are concerns about potential complications such as infection, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's history of cocaine abuse and depression should also be taken into consideration.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further electrolyte imbalances."

   Ethlyene glycol intoxication:  osmolar gap is down to 4, but will
   continue fomepizole until level is <20 as if it is fat soluble, it may
   still be present and leach out.  Await 3:00AM level, if high, recheck,
   if <20, can stop fomepizole.
   Rigidity:  Unclear if this was agitation.   He was also on a  muscle

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with ethylene glycol intoxication. The patient has been receiving treatment, including CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) to remove fluid and fomepizole to prevent further metabolism of ethylene glycol into toxic metabolites. The patient's ethylene glycol levels are decreasing, but there are still concerns about potential complications such as renal failure and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the need for CVVH to remove fluid and the altered mental status. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management of fluid and electrolyte balance will be necessary.

2. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has an electrolyte disorder, with abnormal levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and potassium. Regular monitoring and correction of these imbalances will be required.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to several factors including the effects of ethylene glycol intoxication, lactic acidosis, or medication side effects. Ongoing neurological assessment and monitoring will be necessary to assess the patient's mental status and provide appropriate interventions.

4. Acidosis: The patient had metabolic acidosis, but it has now normalized. However, ongoing monitoring will be required to ensure that acid-base balance is maintained.

   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   - Replete Ca, Mg aggressively
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line in placd and patient will  continue to receive CVVH
   until EG cleared. [**Month (only) 11**] need HD afterward if UO does not restart
   - ethylene glycol level on presentation 314, trending levels [**Hospital1 **] to TID
   (send to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**]). [**11-28**] 3am level was 32.
   -q6h  lytes while on CVVH
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 1mg daily and pyridoxine 100mg
   daily
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during CVVH
   -continue propofol, weaning as tolerated, titrate for agitation.
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K of 6 with tented T waves on presentation. K improved
   w/HD and correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr stable in low 3s.
   Nephrology following. Given IVF yesterday with lasix 120mg IV with only
   50 cc UO.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue CVVH with goal to remove 1L negative today
   - q6h electrolytes check
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switched collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - returned to NSR [**11-27**] to [**11-28**]
   - echo: [**11-27**], Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function. No structural valvular disease.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Elevated lactate Could be falsely elevated due to
   ethylene glycol toxicity, lactate level now normal.  However given
   elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out infection.  LP unremarkable as
   above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration to
   complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity, consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. The patient has been treated with bicarb, fomepizole, and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). His ethylene glycol level on presentation was 314, and subsequent levels have been trending down.

The patient also has hyperkalemia, which improved with hemodialysis (HD) and correction of acidosis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and has been sedated overnight. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by acute renal failure with normal BUN and stable creatinine in the low 3s. Nephrology recommendations have been followed, including IV fluids with Lasix and CVVH to remove 1L of fluid negatively today.

The patient had a fall, resulting in a hard collar being placed, but a CT scan of the head did not show any abnormalities. There is a concern for possible infection, as evidenced by elevated WBC count, lactate level, and LUL infiltrate on chest X-ray. Antibiotics have been started to cover for possible pneumonia, most likely aspiration. Further workup is needed to rule out infection.

Additionally, the patient has a history of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of poisoning/overdose. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, decreased respiratory rate, and an oxygen saturation level of 96%. The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 8,744 mL and output of 9,607 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -863 mL. The urine output is significantly low at 95 mL, while the NG output is high at 900 mL. The respiratory support indicates that the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 551 mL, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 96%.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 3.0, 3.3, and 4.5, indicating acute renal failure. The blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT/AST), electrolytes (Na+/K+), and renal function markers (BUN/creatinine).

The patient's medical history includes adverse drug events, altered mental status, acidosis, and electrolyte/fluid disorders. The assessment plan includes ongoing ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, and"

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  Osmole gap resolved, electrolytes normalized and EG levels
   below 20 yesterday so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine however
   continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is probably and
   intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - HD today
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - f/u renal recs
   -f/u toxicology recs
   -caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently on
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation with weaning.
   Will continue to wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of
   extubation if successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Patient will likely need psych consult and sitter when
   conscious
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved, on HD today
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from HD today both for renal failure and volume
   overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   with HD. Given patient is on Propofol will need to monitor closely for
   hypotension during HD.
   - follow nephrology recs
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Trending down nicely. Low grade fever on occasion over
   the last 2 days but otherwise no clear indication of worsening
   infection. Currently on ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for LUL
   infiltrate ?PNA, most likely aspiration to complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   -trend fever curve
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych
   .
   #UGI bleeding: currently OG to suction bringing back bilious drainage;
   On PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Will clamp and today and give
   something from below.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG to clamp
   -monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. Will clamp OG and watch for BM and
   movement from below.  This way we can feel comfortable giving PO.
   Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult nutrition if patient is not
   able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by tomorrow.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. The osmole gap has resolved, electrolytes have normalized, and ethylene glycol levels are below 20, so CVVHD (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and fomepizole were stopped. However, creatinine continues to rise, indicating ongoing renal impairment likely caused by ethylene glycol toxicity. 

The patient is currently on propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation during weaning. There are concerns about potential complications such as hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, UGI bleeding, and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and depression, and will require psychosocial support and psychiatric consultation. 

In terms of medical complications, the patient has been diagnosed with ethylene glycol toxicity, which has led to acute renal failure. There is also a concern for hyperkalemia, which has been resolved through hemodialysis. The patient's elevated WBC count is trending down, and there are no clear indications of worsening infection. 

The patient has a history of substance abuse, including cocaine use, and depression. He also had a fall and is currently on a hard collar. There is a possibility of imaging if the patient's condition does not improve clinically. 

In terms of treatment, the patient is currently receiving propofol drip, and there are plans to continue weaning off propofol as tolerated. The patient may need a psych consultation and sitter when conscious. Hemodialysis has been initiated due to renal failure and fluid overload. 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of potential complications."

   Respiratory failure: Hypoxemic, has been very positive since admission,
   and CXR with evidence of mild edema on PEEP of 10.  Will get HD today
   to remove fluid.  After which we will
   try to wake up and extubate.
   Ethlyene glycol:  levels <20, fomepizole stopped.
   acute renal failure:  should eventually recover but HD for now to get
   off fluid.
   Neck brace:  will need to wake up before clearing C-spine.
   aspiration PNA:  continue 7 day course of levo/flagyl.
   AFIb:  Echo normla, now back in sinus rhythm.
   Will stop NG tube suction and follow for residuals.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old man with a chief complaint of toxic ingestion. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions.

The patient has a history of ethylene glycol ingestion and has been treated with fomepizole and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). The levels of ethylene glycol are now below 20 mg/dL, so fomepizole has been stopped.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/70 mmHg to 176/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 551 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished, with normal breath sounds and rhonchi. His extremities show 1+ edema, and he has warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive and sedated.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g"

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Resolved.  Presented with Anion gap
   metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with
   ethylene glycol toxicity.  Osmol gap resolved, electrolytes normalized
   and EG levels below 20 so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine
   however continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is
   probably and intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - nephrology following
   - f/u renal recs - HD tomorrow?
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently weaning
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation and increased
   responsiveness (as per nursing staff) with weaning. Will continue to
   wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of extubation today if
   successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Restraints by bedside
   -          Haldol prn agitation
   -          Patient will need psych consult and sitter when conscious
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from ongoing HD today both for renal failure and
   volume overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as
   needed with HD.
   - speak w/nephrology RE likely long-term need for dialysis
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonia:  Aspiration pneumonia on cxr, c/w history, elev
   WBC, low grade temps.  WBC trending down. Low grade fever on occasion
   over the last 3 days could be due to resolving pna or UTI (see below).
   Was on ceftriaxone and flagyl to but switched to levoquin while pt on
   CVVH and receiving frequent doses of IV calcium b/c Ceftriaxone
   precipitates with calcium. CVVH d/c now, so can re-start Ceftriaxone,
   which may cover UTI better.
   - d/c flagyl, do not need to cover anaerobes in setting of new
   aspiration pneumonia.
   - follow BCx
   - follow CXR
   - trend fever curve
   # Positive UA: Has foley since admission. Has been febrile on Levoquin,
   Flagyl. To change antibiotics to Ceftriaxone, may cover UTI better.
   - follow UCx, tailor antibiotics based on results.
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved
   .
   # Cocaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych when extubateed
   .
   #UGI bleeding: OG to suction was bringing back bilious drainage; On
   PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Clamped yesterday w/out problem.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to QD
   - OG to clamp
   - to monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. OG clamped.  PO when extubated as
   mental status allows.  Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult
   nutrition if patient is not able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by
   tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status, which was initially attributed to toxicity. The patient was taking multiple pain and psychotropic medications, including Percocet. Toxicology screens confirmed ethylene glycol poisoning, and the patient received treatment with CVVHD and fomepizole. His creatinine level continues to rise, indicating ongoing renal impairment.

The patient's altered mental status is also likely due to the effects of propofol, a sedative medication. The dose of propofol is being gradually reduced, and the patient shows intermittent episodes of agitation and increased responsiveness.

Renal function tests reveal acute renal failure with oliguria and increasing creatinine levels. The patient is making very little urine, and the renal service suggests ongoing hemodialysis (HD) for both renal failure and volume overload.

The patient has aspiration pneumonia, as evidenced by the chest X-ray and elevated white blood cell count. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted to cover both the aspiration pneumonia and a possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient has a Foley catheter in place and has been febrile while on levofloxacin and metronidazole. The antibiotics are being changed to ceftriaxone, which may provide better coverage for the UTI.

The patient had a fall prior to admission and is currently wearing a hard collar. Sedation will"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status and was found to have anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. The osmole gap has since resolved, electrolytes have normalized, and ethylene glycol levels are below 20. However, his creatinine continues to rise, indicating ongoing renal impairment likely caused by ethylene glycol toxicity. 

The patient has several other medical issues, including altered mental status due to toxicity, hyperkalemia that has resolved, acute renal failure, a fall resulting in a cervical collar, atrial fibrillation that spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm, an elevated white blood cell count, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and fecal incontinence. 

The plan includes initiating hemodialysis (HD) today due to renal failure and fluid overload, continuing to wean off propofol as tolerated, considering a psychiatric consultation and sitter when conscious, monitoring electrolytes closely, and following nephrology recommendations. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, infections (given the elevated WBC count), further gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory complications due to the patient's current intubation status."

   37 yo male admitted with Ethylene Glycol ingestion and now with course
   complicated by persistent respiratory failure and renal failure with
   mental status as primary limiting factor contributing to persistent
   respiratory failure.  He has had continued issues of fever through to
   this morning and slow return to organized mental status.  He does,
   however, have good tolerance of ventilatory wean with favorable
   pulmonary mechanics and reassuring blood gases.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with Ethylene Glycol ingestion. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and renal failure, with mental status being the primary limiting factor contributing to persistent respiratory failure. The patient has had continued issues of fever and slow return to organized mental status. He has good tolerance of ventilatory wean with favorable pulmonary mechanics and reassuring blood gases.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 2]) - The patient continues to be able to follow simple commands but with slow response time. Secretions are moderate and thin. The patient has a favorable RSBI, which is not specific for success with extubation. Extubation is planned today, and tachypnea will be evaluated with ABG.
2. H/O POISONING / OVERDOSE, OTHER - Dialysis is scheduled for tomorrow.
3. RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) - Cultures will be pursued from the catheter, and dialysis is planned for tomorrow.
4. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) - Folate/Thiamine will be given. Propofol will be weaned to off today, and the patient will be extubated today. It is unlikely that altered mental status is due to the initial ingestion. Seroquel PRN will be given following extubation or if the patient is agitated peri-extubation."
