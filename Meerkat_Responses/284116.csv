   2. Severe liver cirrhosis with recanalization of the umbilical vein and
   varices adjacent to the gastroesophageal junction and moderate
   intra-abdominal
   ascites.
   3. Apparent wall thickening of the ascending colon may be related to
   liver
   disease and intra-abdominal ascites; however colitis cannot be
   excluded.
   Clinical correlation is recommended.
   4. Peripancreatic fluid may be related to liver disease; however
   pancreatitis
   is not entirely excluded and correlation with amylase, lipase is
   recommended.
   These values were not available at the time of this dictation.

   consolidation.
   [**11-23**] echo
   IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction with some
   regionality. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Elevated filling
   pressures.
   Among other etiologies, these findings could be consistent with a
   global process (septic, toxic, metabolic) or a variant of acute stress
   (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. Multivessel coronary artery disease as the
   sole etiology of these abnormalities is less likely.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 48 year old gentleman with ESLD [**2-15**] Hemochromatosis presents in
   cardiogenic shock with hypoxic respiratory failure of unknown etiology,
   including preliminarily negative CT head, CT neck, and LP.
   1. Shock: The patient has features of hypovolemic and cardogenic shock
   (peri/myocarditis, silent MI) with a pericardial rub and some EKG
   changes.  Septic shock is also possible but his peripheral
   vasoconstriction is not consistent with this. Thought to possibly be
   meningitis but ruled out with negative CSF.
   - F/u Cards consult to see how to further work up the etiology of this
   heart failure
   - Continue on Levophed only and optimize cardiac output
   - Continue Vanc/ Cefipime / Acyclovir / Cipro but will d/c Ampicillin
   as this was covering Listeria and CSF Gstain is negative
   - F/u flu DFA
   - F/u LP Cx
s and serologies
   - Need to get consent and do HIV test today
   - F/u final read of CT head and neck
   - F/u PPD tomorrow
   - If any changes seen on telemetry get 12 lead EKG
   - Consider echo with bubble study
   2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient appears to have a chronic
   PE and bilateral effusions on CT chest but his cause for hypoxia is
   unclear.  His respiratory status is tenuous.
   - Continues on the ventilator, try to maximize settings
   3. ESLD/Hemochromatosis: Unable to tap ascites, known varices. LFT's
   trending up today.
   - T & S, 2 peripherals, Blood consent
   - Paracentesis if possible
   - Hold spironolactone/nadolol while unstable
   - Lactulose for ? encephalopathy
   4. Sore throat: Concerning for lemierres, retropharyngeal or neck
   abscess/infection, meningitis
   - Head/Neck CT has been negative and CSF also negative
   5. DM2: Glargine & insulin SS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, Bowel reg, will change Omeprazole to
   IV form or IV H2B
   Access: peripherals x2, Art line, PA catheter

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and hemochromatosis presenting in cardiogenic shock with hypoxic respiratory failure of unknown etiology. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition.

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing features of hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock. There is a possibility of septic shock as well, but his peripheral vasoconstriction is not consistent with this. The cause of the shock needs further investigation.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a chronic pulmonary embolism (PE) and bilateral pleural effusions. However, the cause of his hypoxia is unclear. His respiratory status is tenuous, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation.

3. ESLD/Hemochromatosis: The patient has known liver disease and hemochromatosis. His liver function tests (LFTs) are trending up today. There is also ascites present, and paracentesis may be necessary.

4. Sore throat: The patient has a sore throat, which is concerning for Lemierre's syndrome, retropharyngeal or neck abscess/infection, and meningitis. However, the head/neck CT has been negative, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is also negative.

5. DM2 (type 2 diabetes mellitus): The patient requires glycemic"

   2. Severe liver cirrhosis with recanalization of the umbilical vein and
   varices adjacent to the gastroesophageal junction and moderate
   intra-abdominal

   liver
   disease and intra-abdominal ascites; however colitis cannot be
   excluded.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 48 year old gentleman with ESLD [**2-15**] Hemochromatosis presents in
   cardiogenic shock with hypoxic respiratory failure of unknown etiology,
   including preliminarily negative CT head, CT neck, and LP.
   1. Shock: The patient has features of hypovolemic and cardogenic shock
   (peri/myocarditis, silent MI) with a pericardial rub and some EKG
   changes.  Septic shock is also possible but his peripheral
   vasoconstriction is not consistent with this. Thought to possibly be
   meningitis but ruled out with negative CSF.
   - F/u Cards consult to see how to further work up the etiology of this
   heart failure
   - Currently on Neo but will add back Levophed
   - Continue Vanc/ Cefipime / Ampicillin/ Acyclovir/Cipro
   - F/u flu DFA
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Cards consult
   - F/u LP
   - Need to get consent and do HIV test today
   - F/u final read of CT head and neck
   - F/u PPD tomorrow
   - If any changes seen on telemetry get 12 lead EKG
   - echo with bubble tomorrow
   2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient appears to have a chronic
   PE and bilateral effusions on CT chest but his cause for hypoxia is
   unclear.  His respiratory status is tenuous.
   - Continues on the ventilator, try to maximize settings
   3. ESLD/Hemochromatosis: Unable to tap ascites, known varices. LFT's
   trending up today.
   - T & S, 2 peripherals, Blood consent
   - Paracentesis if possible
   - Hold spironolactone/nadolol while unstable
   - Lactulose for ? encephalopathy
   4. Sore throat: Concerning for lemierres, retropharyngeal or neck
   abscess/infection, meningitis
   - Head/Neck CT has been negative and CSF also negative
   5. DM2: Glargine & insulin SS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

","The patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and hemochromatosis presenting in cardiogenic shock with hypoxic respiratory failure of unknown etiology. The patient has features of hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, with a pericardial rub and some EKG changes. Sepsis is also possible but his peripheral vasoconstriction is not consistent with this. 

The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and he appears to have a chronic PE (pulmonary embolism) and bilateral pleural effusions on CT chest. His cause for hypoxia is unclear. 

The patient's liver function tests are trending up today, indicating worsening liver function. He has known varices and is unable to tap ascites. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory failure, and shock. He requires intensive care unit (ICU) management, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and hemodynamic monitoring. 

Further diagnostic tests are pending, including HIV testing, flu DFA (direct fluorescent antibody), and cryptococcal antigen. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   48-year-old man with
          Shock
          Hypoxemic respiratory failure
          Encephalopathy
          Cirrhosis
   His shock picture is likely mixed.  On exam, he is cold and clamped
   down.  Thermodilution cardiac output has been quite variable.
   Creatinine and lactate are reassuring; MVO2 is relatively reassuring,
   but hard to know what his VO2 is.  Hypoxemia is severe, and relatively
   clear CXR suggests shunt.  Similar RA, PCWP, PA diastolic raises
   concern for pericardial or restrictive disease.  Substantial whip in
   wedge tracing right now; hard to assess for waveforms.
   Today, we will
          trial dobuta on top of levophed today.
          Consult ID for recommendations about further potential
   infectious assessment.  Fairly extensive evaluation to date, including
   LP, has been unremarkable.
          TSH/cortisol
          Discuss with cardiology regarding further diagnostic and
   therapeutic maneuvers, including potential diuresis, right heart
   cath/left heart cath, assist devices.
          Other issues as per ICU team note today.

   Echo confirms ASD with R
 L shunt at rest.
   CO variable throughout the day, sometimes with discrepancy between Fick
   and thermodilution.
   Seen by ID.  Most recommendations implemented; based on my exam and
   review of CT showing very small ascites, I feel that the risks of
   paracentesis substantially outweigh potential benefits at present.
   We will continue tailored therapy, supporting with levophed and if
   needed dobuta.  [**Month (only) 51**] be reasonable to trial decreased PEEP given PFO,
   but leave stable for now.  I agree with cardiology that there is no
   acute need for mechanical assist device.  If BP and other parameters

","The patient is a 48-year-old man with a chief complaint of shock and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been sedated and unable to provide a medical history. The patient has undergone several invasive procedures, including invasive ventilation, placement of a PA catheter, and a lumbar puncture.

The patient's allergies are unknown, and he has received various antibiotics and antiviral medications. His current infusions include fentanyl and midazolam. The patient is also receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and other medications for bowel regularity, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous thromboembolism prevention.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation is 99%, and his temperature is within normal range. The patient's CVP is elevated at 27 mmHg, and his PAP is (37 mmHg) / (29 mmHg). His PCWP is 12 mmHg, and his CO/CI values are (3.7 L/min) / (1.7 L/min/m2) according to Fick and (3.9 L/min) / (1.8 L/min/m2) according to CCO.

The patient's mixed venous O2 saturation is 46%, indicating poor tissue perfusion. His total fluid input and output balance shows a positive balance of 7,542 mL. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   48-year-old man with
          Shock
          Hypoxemic respiratory failure
          Encephalopathy
          Cirrhosis
   His shock picture is likely mixed.  On exam, he is cold and clamped
   down.  Thermodilution cardiac output has been quite variable.
   Creatinine and lactate are reassuring; MVO2 is relatively reassuring,
   but hard to know what his VO2 is.  Hypoxemia is severe, and relatively
   clear CXR suggests shunt.  Similar RA, PCWP, PA diastolic raises
   concern for pericardial or restrictive disease.  Substantial whip in
   wedge tracing right now; hard to assess for waveforms.
   Today, we will
          trial dobuta on top of levophed today.
          Consult ID for recommendations about further potential
   infectious assessment.  Fairly extensive evaluation to date, including
   LP, has been unremarkable.
          TSH/cortisol
          Discuss with cardiology regarding further diagnostic and
   therapeutic maneuvers, including potential diuresis, right heart
   cath/left heart cath, assist devices.
          Other issues as per ICU team note today.
   I
ve discussed with wife.  Further updates to follow.

   Total time spent: 80 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old man with a chief complaint of shock and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with mixed shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and cirrhosis.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm and hypotension with a blood pressure of 101/63 mmHg. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, but his oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient is on invasive ventilation with a set tidal volume of 430 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. His PEEP is set at 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 is 100%.

The patient's cardiac output is variable, and there are concerns about pericardial or restrictive disease due to similar right atrial, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressures. There is also evidence of whip in the wedge tracing.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and elevated lactate levels. His blood glucose levels are within normal limits, but other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes are abnormal.

Imaging studies including a chest X-ray and head CT are pending. The patient's microbiology results are negative for flu DFA, but there is a positive MRSA screen. His ECG shows low limb lead voltage."

   - cardiology wanted to go to cath and possibly place impala/balloon
   pump.  Echo before-hand looked improved so they decided to hold off.
   - ECHO with bubble study: A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial
   septum is seen at rest with prompt appearance of
   contrast in the left heart after intravenous injection c/w an
   atrial septal defect.
   - ID: switched cefepime to zosyn for better gram negative coverage,
   started clindamycin for possible toxic shock syndrome. Started
   doxycycline in case of lyme/erlichia.  Recommended paracentesis.
   Recommended multiple viral serologies which were ordered.
   - Patient was shifted around midnight and became acutely hypotensive.
   Levophed had to be increased from 0.08 to 0.2 to maintain pressures.
   Patient was given small dose of dobutamine, but became tachy to 120.
   Appeared ashen on exam.  Talked to cardiology, patient also had
   low-grade temp, so intervention seemed unwise.  Recommended considering
   diuresis.
   - Temperature to 102.4 at 2am. Blood cultures sent, urine cx and CXR
   ordered.  CXR unchaged.
   - Patient became acutely tachycardic w/ afib w/ RVR around 3:30 to 4am,
   dropped pressures.  Supported w/ levophed but tenuous.  Tried to shock,
   but did not come out.  Increasingly febrile (back up to 102.4) despite
   cooling blanket, ice packs and tyelenol.  Given digoxin load.  Family
   called to bedside.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 48-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and hemochromatosis presenting in cardiogenic shock with hypoxic respiratory failure of unknown etiology. The patient's condition is critical, and several potential medical complications can arise based on the information provided in the progress note. These include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by inadequate blood flow to the body's organs and tissues due to impaired heart function. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not promptly managed.

2. Septic shock: The patient has signs of infection, such as fever and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting the possibility of sepsis. If sepsis progresses to septic shock, it can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which means the lungs are not adequately exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. This can result in low oxygen levels in the bloodstream and tissue hypoxia. If left untreated, it may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other complications like pneumonia or atelectasis.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's ESLD, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease. Symptoms may include confusion, altered level of consciousness, and even coma.

5. Coagulopathy"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   A 48 year old gentleman with ESLD [**2-15**] Hemochromatosis presents in
   cardiogenic shock with hypoxic respiratory failure of unknown etiology,
   including preliminarily negative CT head, CT neck, and LP.
   1. Shock: The patient appears to be in cardiogenic shock with cool,
   clammy extremities and elevated CVPs.  His low CO is low, worsened by
   the rapid rate.  Previous attempts at cardioversion were compromised by
   high sympathetic tone of fevers and many anti-arrhythmic medications
   risk lowering his blood pressure.  Though he is afebrile, we will
   continue all antibiotics for now until clinical condition improves.
   - Continue digoxin load through today, then if it seems effective can
   give daily dose.
   - Goal is to lower temperature and re-attempt cardioversion if his
   temperature comes down appreciably.
   - Continue on just levophed as pressor.
   - monitor renal failure.
   - F/u Cards recs
   - Vanc
   - F/u multiple viral cultures including DFA.
   - f/u HIV test.
   - f/u PPD today.
   - Consider lower PEEP to allow better heart filling.
   2.  Fevers: Unclear whether patient is septic (which is unlikely) or
   febrile from other source.  Patient on cipro/zosyn/vanc for generalized
   bacterial infection, clindamycin for coverage of toxic shock and
   doxycycline for atypical source.  Other possibility for fever would be
   a drug fever.  We will be cautious in removing antibiotics, but if
   nothing works for taking down fevers, can consider NSAIDS (despite
   renal toxicity) and d/c
ing antibiotics (an almost last resort).
   3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient is requiring high levels of
   respiratory support but his CXR is relatively clear.  Reason is
   unclear.  Possibilities include ARDS (most likely) and MI.
   - Continues on the ventilator, try to maximize settings
   3. ESLD/Hemochromatosis: Unable to tap ascites, known varices. LFT's
   trending up.
   - T & S, 2 peripherals, Blood consent
   - Paracentesis if possible
   - Hold spironolactone/nadolol while unstable
   4. Sore throat: Concerning for lemierres, retropharyngeal or neck
   abscess/infection, meningitis
   - Head/Neck CT has been negative and CSF also negative
   5. DM2: Glargine & insulin SS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and hemochromatosis who presents in cardiogenic shock with hypoxic respiratory failure of unknown etiology. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the information provided:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient appears to be in cardiogenic shock with cool, clammy extremities and elevated CVP (central venous pressure). His low CO (cardiac output) is low, worsened by the rapid heart rate. Previous attempts at cardioversion were compromised by high sympathetic tone, fever, and anti-arrhythmic medications that risk lowering his blood pressure.

2. Septic shock: Although the patient's fever has improved, there is still a concern for septic shock due to the presence of fever and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Monitoring renal function is important in this case.

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is requiring high levels of respiratory support, but the reason for this is unclear. Possibilities include ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and MI (myocardial infarction).

4. ESLD/Hemochromatosis: The patient has ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and hemochromatosis, which can lead to complications such as ascites, varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. Paracentesis (draining fluid from the abdomen) may be necessary if asc"

   - ECHO with bubble study: A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial
   septum is seen at rest with prompt appearance of
   contrast in the left heart after intravenous injection c/w an
   atrial septal defect.
   - ID: switched cefepime to zosyn for better gram negative coverage,
   started clindamycin for possible toxic shock syndrome. Started
   doxycycline in case of lyme/erlichia.  Recommended paracentesis.
   Recommended multiple viral serologies which were ordered.
   - Patient was shifted around midnight and became acutely hypotensive.
   Levophed had to be increased from 0.08 to 0.2 to maintain pressures.
   Patient was given small dose of dobutamine, but became tachy to 120.
   Appeared ashen on exam.  Talked to cardiology, patient also had
   low-grade temp, so intervention seemed unwise.  Recommended considering
   diuresis.
   - Temperature to 102.4 at 2am. Blood cultures sent, urine cx and CXR
   ordered.  CXR unchaged.
   - Patient became acutely tachycardic w/ afib w/ RVR around 3:30 to 4am,
   dropped pressures.  Supported w/ levophed but tenuous.  Tried to shock,
   but did not come out.  Increasingly febrile (back up to 102.4) despite
   cooling blanket, ice packs and tyelenol.  Given digoxin load.  Family

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and hemochromatosis who presents in cardiogenic shock with hypoxic respiratory failure of unknown etiology. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Shock: The patient appears to be in cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by low cardiac output leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. This can result in organ damage and failure if not managed promptly.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, indicating inadequate oxygenation of the blood. This can be due to various causes such as pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prompt intervention is necessary to support the patient's breathing and improve oxygenation.

3. ESLD/Hemochromatosis: The patient has ESLD and hemochromatosis, which can lead to liver dysfunction and complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of infections. Management should focus on stabilizing liver function and preventing further deterioration.

4. Sore throat: The patient's sore throat may be concerning for Lemierre's syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the bacterium Fusobacterium necrophorum. This condition can lead to neck abscess, deep vein thrombosis, and septic emboli. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and further evaluation are required to rule out"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old man with multi-organ failure in the setting of hemochromatosis. He is experiencing cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and a large patent foramen ovale (PFO) with right-to-left shunt. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: This condition is characterized by impaired blood flow to the body due to the heart's inability to pump effectively. Complications associated with cardiogenic shock include organ damage, poor tissue perfusion, and potential cardiac arrest.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which means that his lungs are not adequately supplying his body with oxygen. Complications associated with respiratory failure can include further deterioration of oxygenation, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.

3. Fever: The patient's elevated temperature suggests an underlying infection. Complications associated with fever can include sepsis, organ dysfunction, and potential progression to septic shock.

4. Renal Failure: The minimal urine output indicates possible renal failure, which can be caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Complications associated with renal failure can include electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and acute kidney injury.

5. Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO): A PFO is a hole in the heart that didn't close properly after birth. In this case, the PFO is causing a right"

   48 yo man with multi-organ failure in setting of hemachromatosis with
   cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, large PFO with right to left
   shunt.
   1. Cardiogenic shock: More hypotensive with high rate.  Dig loading.
   On norepinephrine.  Unable to cardiovert electrically overnight - will
   reassess potential lefficacy of DCCV with fever down - getting Tylenol.
   2. Respiratory Failure: CXR clear despite refractory hypoxemia
   requiring FIO2 of 1.0.  Could PEEP be augmenting R to L shunt?  WIll
   try to decrease PEEP slightly and evaluate pO2 - but need to do this
   very carefully.
   3. Fever: No clear source at this point - being covered broadly with
   multiple antibiotics.  ? Drug fever.  Ascites too deep to tap at this
   point.
   4. Renal failure: Urine output is minimal - likely due to worsening
   cardiac output in setting of tachycardia
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is extememly tenuous with a very poor prognosis.

   Patient is critically ill
   Addendum: Tried trial of decrease of PEEP to 12
 pt desaturated and
   PEEP brought back up to 15.  Discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2736**] from
   cardiology
 given that we cannot meaningfully reverse his cardiogenic
   shock and hypoxemia with our current management, we will proceed with
   attempt to put in endovascular device in cath lab that will augment LV
   output and endovasucular closure of ASD.  If he does have hemodynamic
   improvement with device, he will go to the CCU for further management.
   Team discussed with family who are in agreement with plan.
    Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with multi-organ failure in the setting of hemochromatosis. The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and a large patent foramen ovale (PFO) with a right-to-left shunt. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is hypotensive and has a high heart rate. Dig loading has been initiated, and the patient is on norepinephrine. There have been unsuccessful attempts at cardioversion, and the possibility of using defibrillation with fever down is being considered.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires supplemental oxygen at a high flow rate (FiO2 of 1.0) and has refractory hypoxemia. It is suspected that increased PEEP may be augmenting the right-to-left shunt. The plan is to decrease PEEP slightly and evaluate the patient's oxygenation carefully.

3. Fever: The patient has a high temperature, but no clear source has been identified yet. The patient is being covered broadly with multiple antibiotics, and drug fever is a possible consideration. Ascites is too deep to tap at this point.

4. Renal failure: The patient has minimal urine output, likely due to worsening cardiac output in the setting of tachycardia.

Overall, the patient is in extremely critical condition with a very poor prognosis"

   etiology.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The likelihood of multivessel disease is low given the
   acute change in his EF and lack of signficant changes on ECG.
   .
   # PUMP: Decreased EF within the past couple of month, suggest an acute
   process.  Could be [**2-15**] to an infectious / progression of
   hemachromatosis with new diagnosed ASD / metabolic / toxic related
   cardiomyopathy.  With the ASD, this provided a R->L shunt [**2-15**] chronic
   PE and hemachromatosis with a component of restrictive CM leading to
   pulm HTN.  He is in cardiogenic shock without an obvious source of
   infection (on multiple antibiotics with a raising wbc).
   - trend hemodynamics
   - d/c levophed, vassopressin
   - reduce impella

   # RHYTHM: patient was in AFib with RVR the night prior to procedure and
   CCU admission.  Pressure tend to drop during these episodes, intially
   attempted to shock but failed to respond.  Likely [**2-15**] fever and
   possible infectious process, was digoxin loaded.
   - consider pressures support during these episodes
   - rate control as tolerated with dilt/BB vs. DCCV
   - F/u multiple viral cultures including DFA, HIV, PPD today.
   - Consider lower PEEP to allow better heart filling.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient is requiring high levels of
   respiratory support but his CXR is relatively clear.  Reason is likely
   [**2-15**] ASD mediated R->L shunt as after ASD closure, patient's O2 sat
   improved.
   - has not improved with Impella device
   - Continues on the ventilator - consider ARDS vent settings.
   - wean off sedation as tolerated
   - wean off vent as tolerated

   (Head/Neck CT has been negative and CSF has been negative).  Patient on
   cipro/zosyn/vanc for generalized bacterial infection, clindamycin for
   coverage of toxic shock and doxycycline for atypical source.  Other
   possibility for fever would be a drug fever. ID has been following.
   - on Vancomycin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin
   - Doxycycline for lyme or erlichia
   - Clindamycin for possible toxic shock syndrome
   - follow up on viral serologies

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hemochromatosis presenting with sudden onset of severe cardiogenic shock of unknown etiology. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications including vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient has been experiencing fever, respiratory distress, and metabolic acidosis. He is also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and an ASD (atrial septal defect) with right-to-left shunt. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition is already complicated by cardiogenic shock, which can lead to poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxic respiratory failure require close monitoring and management of his ventilator settings.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance needs to be corrected promptly to prevent further organ damage.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's irregular heart rhythm may increase the risk of clot formation and embolism. Rate control and anticoagulation should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male at baseline immunosupressed given DM and hemochromatosis,
   presented with sudden onset of severe cardiogenic shock of unknown
   etiology.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The likelihood of multivessel disease is low given the
   acute change in his EF and lack of signficant changes on ECG.
   .
   # PUMP: Decreased EF within the past couple of month, suggest an acute
   process.  Could be [**2-15**] to an infectious / progression of
   hemachromatosis with new diagnosed ASD / metabolic / toxic related
   cardiomyopathy.  With the ASD, this provided a R->L shunt [**2-15**] chronic
   PE and hemachromatosis with a component of restrictive CM leading to
   pulm HTN.  He is in cardiogenic shock without an obvious source of
   infection (on multiple antibiotics with a raising wbc).
   - trend hemodynamics
   - on levophed, vassopressin
   - pending cultures/serologies.
   .
   # RHYTHM: patient was in AFib with RVR the night prior to procedure and
   CCU admission.  Pressure tend to drop during these episodes, intially
   attempted to shock but failed to respond.  Likely [**2-15**] fever and
   possible infectious process, was digoxin loaded.
   - consider pressures support during these episodes
   - rate control as tolerated with dilt/BB vs. DCCV
   - F/u multiple viral cultures including DFA, HIV, PPD today.
   - Consider lower PEEP to allow better heart filling.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient is requiring high levels of
   respiratory support but his CXR is relatively clear.  Reason is likely
   [**2-15**] ASD mediated R->L shunt as after ASD closure, patient's O2 sat
   improved.
   - Continues on the ventilator - consider ARDS vent settings.
   - wean off sedation as tolerated
   - wean off vent as tolerated
   .
   # ID: Patient has been spiking fevers without an obvious source
   (Head/Neck CT has been negative and CSF has been negative).  Patient on
   cipro/zosyn/vanc for generalized bacterial infection, clindamycin for
   coverage of toxic shock and doxycycline for atypical source.  Other
   possibility for fever would be a drug fever. ID has been following.
   - on Vancomycin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin
   - Doxycycline for lyme or erlichia
   - Clindamycin for possible toxic shock syndrome
   - follow up on viral serologies
   .
   # ESLD/hemachromatosis:  Unable to tap ascites, known varices. LFT's
   trending up.  Likely [**2-15**] ASD shunt with R->L physiology and more
   recently cardiogenic shock.
   - T & S, 2 peripherals
   - f/u cultures
   - Paracentesis if possible
   - Hold spironolactone/nadolol while unstable
   - on lactulose (consider rifaximen)
   .
   # DM2: Glargine & insulin SS
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, RIJ, Art line, PA catheter
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -Pain management with fentanyl gtt
   -Bowel regimen with Bowel reg, lansoprazole

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hemochromatosis who presented with sudden onset of severe cardiogenic shock of unknown etiology. The patient has multiple comorbidities including DM, hemochromatosis, and an atrial septal defect (ASD).

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Cardiogenic shock without an obvious source of infection.
2. Fever.
3. Metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis.
4. Hypoxic respiratory failure requiring high levels of respiratory support.
5. Decreased ejection fraction (EF) within the past couple of months, suggesting an acute process.
6. Known varices and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).
7. Unable to tap ascites.
8. Known atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR).
9. Intolerance to blood pressure support during AFib/RVR episodes.
10. Intolerance to increased PEEP, which is causing better heart filling.
11. Spiking fevers without an obvious source.
12. On multiple antibiotics with a rising white blood cell count (WBC).
13. Recent placement of an Impella device with a kinked and broken feed line.
14. Need for vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure.
15. High lactate levels.
16. Elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (CK, CK"
