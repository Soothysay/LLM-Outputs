   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF
   55% with LVH), admitted for CHF exacerbation.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Etiology unclear. This could represent
   distributive/septic shock. However, the patient does not have any
   elevated WBC and he is not febrile. This could also represent
   cardiogenic shock. However, this does not seem to be the case on exam
   or on echo. Low EKG voltage in limb leads raises the possibility of an
   infiltrative process such as amyloidosis. TSH and cortisol normal. The
   patient
s episodes of hypotension do not seem to correlate with any
   clinical events and are generally asymptomatic.
   - continue to wean levophed as tolerated
   - f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures
   - arterial line in place for close BP monitoring
   - right heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9. However, OMR review reveals worsening of the
   patient's renal fxn over the past few months. FeUrea was consistent
   with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and renal ultrasound more
   consistent with intrinsic renal cause.
   - f/u renal U/S (final read)
   - f/u UPEP and SPEP
   - consider renal consult
   .
   #. CHF: Bedside echo revealed borderline RV function, and the patient
   does exhibit signs of right-sided HF on exam (elevated JVP, LE edema).
   Likely related to patient
s COPD, although a more acute process such as
   PE could also be implicated.
   - holding further diuresis for now
   - low salt diet
   - LENIs to evaluate for DVT
   .
   #. Elevated Troponin: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but
   troponins are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - maintain active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue iron supplementation

   # COPD: Currently presentation not consistent with COPD exacerbation,
   although COPD is likely related to patient
s right-sided heart failure.
   - continue nebs PRN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF). He was admitted for a CHF exacerbation.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear. It could be due to distributive/septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or an infiltrative process such as amyloidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened over the past few months, indicating a decline in renal function. Renal ultrasound findings suggest an intrinsic renal cause rather than a pre-renal state. Further investigations and consultation with a renal specialist are recommended for further evaluation and management.

3. CHF: The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), lower extremity edema, and borderline right ventricular function on bedside echo. This may be related to the patient's COPD or potentially due to a pulmonary embolism (PE). Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

4. Elevated Troponin: The patient has some elevation in troponin levels, although the CK levels are normal. This suggests that the elevation may not be related to acute"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF). The patient was admitted for a CHF exacerbation. 

The patient's current medical complications include hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), diarrhea, lower extremity edema, elevated troponin levels, microcytic anemia, and vitamin B12 deficiency. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening of hypotension leading to shock, further deterioration of renal function, exacerbation of CHF symptoms, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to lower extremity edema, progression of microcytic anemia, and potential vitamin B12 deficiency-related neurological complications. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, especially blood pressure, renal function, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels. Regular assessments of the patient's respiratory status, cardiac function, and gastrointestinal symptoms should also be conducted. Additionally, appropriate interventions such as medication adjustments, fluid management, and nutritional support should be implemented to address the patient's medical complications and prevent potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted for a CHF exacerbation. 

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. 

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing intermittent hypotension, but the exact cause is unclear. It is important to continue weaning levophed as tolerated and follow up with blood, urine, and sputum cultures. Additionally, an arterial line will be kept in place for close blood pressure monitoring, and a right heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy may be necessary.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened from 1.9 to 2.2, indicating a decline in renal function. There are signs of both pre-renal and intrinsic renal causes. Further evaluation is needed, including follow-up renal ultrasound, UPEP (urinary protein electrophoresis), SPEP (serum protein electrophoresis), and a renal consult.

3. CHF: The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and borderline right ventricular function. A right heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy should be performed to further assess the condition. Diuretics should be withheld"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and dilated congestive heart failure (dCHF), admitted for an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's current condition includes hypotension of unclear etiology, acute on chronic renal failure, CHF, diarrhea, lower extremity edema, elevated troponin, microcytic anemia, COPD, vitamin B12 deficiency, and a history of ethanol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's intermittent hypotension may be due to sepsis or an infiltrative cardiac process such as amyloidosis. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function over the past few months indicates a possible intrinsic renal cause. Further investigation and renal consultation are required.
3. CHF: The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and lower extremity edema. Right heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy will help evaluate the underlying cause.
4. Diarrhea: The etiology of the patient's diarrhea is unclear. Monitoring for electrolyte abnormalities and stool guaiac testing are recommended.
5. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient's leg swelling is likely a consequence of heart failure. Evaluation for deep vein throm"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and decompensated heart failure (last ejection fraction 55% with left ventricular hypertrophy). The patient was admitted for a heart failure exacerbation.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the assessment and plan:

1. Hypotension: Intermittent hypotension with unclear etiology. The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, as indicated by the Swan-Ganz values. Close monitoring of blood pressure and continuation of weaning levophed as tolerated are recommended. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause of the hypotension.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.9 to 2.2, indicating worsening renal function over the past few months. The presence of proteinuria and renal ultrasound findings suggest an intrinsic renal cause. It is important to follow up with renal U/S (final read), UPEP, SPEP, and consult a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and lower extremity edema. A bedside echo revealed borderline right ventricular function. Right heart catheterization with endomy"

   74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH),
   admitted for CHF exacerbation.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Intermittent.  Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] EKG voltage in
   limb leads raises the possibility of an infiltrative process such as
   amyloidosis. No evidence of infection/sepsis.
   - continue to wean levophed as tolerated
   - f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures
   - arterial line in place for close BP monitoring
   - right heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9. However, OMR review reveals worsening of the
   patient's renal fxn over the past few months. FeUrea was consistent
   with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and renal ultrasound more
   consistent with intrinsic renal cause.
   - f/u renal U/S (final read)
   - f/u UPEP and SPEP
   - renal consult
   .
   #. CHF: Bedside echo revealed borderline RV function, and the patient
   does exhibit signs of right-sided HF on exam (elevated JVP, LE edema).
   Will evaluate with right heart cath and endomyocardial biopsy, as
   above.
   - holding further diuresis for
   now
   - low salt diet
   .
   #. Diarrhea: Etiology unclear.  Non-bloody, and no C. diff related.
   Could be cause by bowel edema in the setting of right heart failure.
   - monitor for/treat electrolyte abnormalities
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #. Lower extremity edema: Likely a consequence of heart failure.
   - LENIs to evaluate r/o DVT
   .
   #. Elevated Troponin: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but
   troponins are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.
   - maintain active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue iron supplementation
   .
   # COPD: Continue nebs PRN
   .
   # Vit B12 Deficiency: Continue supplementation
   .
   # H/O ETOH Abuse: Per pt, he has not used alcohol in 3 months.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and dilated congestive heart failure (last ejection fraction 55% with left ventricular hypertrophy). He was admitted for a congestive heart failure exacerbation.
- The patient is currently experiencing hypotension with an unclear etiology. There is also a possibility of an infiltrative process such as amyloidosis based on EKG voltage in limb leads. No evidence of infection/sepsis is seen.
- The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with worsening renal function over the past few months. However, the renal ultrasound indicates an intrinsic renal cause rather than a pre-renal state.
- The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure and lower extremity edema.
- The patient has diarrhea with an unclear etiology, which could be related to bowel edema in the setting of right heart failure.
- The patient has microcytic anemia with iron deficiency, likely due to chronic blood loss.
- The patient is being treated for COPD, vitamin B12 deficiency, and a history of ethanol abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's intermittent hypotension requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause. If left untreated, it can lead"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and dilated congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for CHF exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications and conditions.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient underwent a trans thoracic echo, urine culture, and placement of a PA catheter.
- He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concerns of possible sepsis.
- The patient had low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and was on vasopressor support.
- There are large pleural effusions, possible site infection, and consideration for a thoracentesis.
- The patient has microcytic anemia, and iron deficiency anemia was confirmed on recent iron studies.
- He has elevated troponin levels, but these are not consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient has worsening renal function over the past few months.
- He exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure.
- Diarrhea is present, but etiology is unclear.
- Lower extremity edema is observed, likely due to heart failure.
- The patient has a history of ethanol abuse but denies any alcohol use for the past three months.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: Intermittent hypotension is present, with an unclear etiology. The patient's EKG voltage raises the possibility of an infiltrative process such as amy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of anemia, chronic diastolic heart failure, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock secondary to an infection. The patient underwent an emergency thoracic echo and urine culture. He also had a percutaneous arterial catheter placed in the cardiac catheterization lab. The patient was taken to the operating room for a change of coagulation profile and consideration of sepsis. In the OR, the patient's systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was low, indicating potential septic shock. Repeat blood cultures were sent, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started with vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin. The patient also has large pleural effusions, possible site infection, and is being considered for a thoracentesis in the morning. A CT scan is also planned. A biopsy of the pleural effusion has been deferred, with a recommendation to follow up with serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) for possible multiple myeloma. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he is currently on vasopressor support with levo/neo. He has a history of allergies to cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, piperacillin, and levofloxacin. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH),
   admitted for CHF exacerbation.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Intermittent.  Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] EKG voltage in
   limb leads raises the possibility of an infiltrative process such as
   amyloidosis. However, Swan-Ganz values c/w possible sepsis.
   Endomyocardial biopsy deferred yesterday.
   - attempt to wean pressors as tolerated
   - f/u micro data; NGTD
   - arterial line in place for close BP monitoring
   - f/u SPEP and UPEP
   - f/u final read of CXR and KUB
   - consider further imaging with CT scan; however, elevated creatinine
   will prevent IV contrast and will make study less useful
   - consider tapping PE to look for possible infection in effusion fluid
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9. However, OMR review reveals worsening of the
   patient's renal fxn over the past few months. FeUrea was consistent
   with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and renal ultrasound more
   consistent with intrinsic renal cause.  Creatinine has remained stable
   throughout CCU stay thus far.  Renal u/s only revealed bilateral renal
   cysts.
   - f/u UPEP and SPEP
   - renal consult
   .
   #. CHF: Bedside echo revealed borderline RV function, and the patient
   does exhibit signs of right-sided HF on exam (elevated JVP, LE edema).
   Echo showed moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and
   increased PCWP, as well as pleural effusions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and decompensated heart failure (last ejection fraction 55% with left ventricular hypertrophy). He was admitted for a congestive heart failure exacerbation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent hypotension with unclear etiology. This could be due to sepsis or an infiltrative process such as amyloidosis. Further investigation and close monitoring are needed.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been worsening over the past few months, indicating renal dysfunction. This could be due to a pre-renal state, intrinsic renal cause, or bilateral renal cysts seen on ultrasound.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure, including elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), lower extremity edema, and pleural effusions. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) were observed on echocardiogram.

4. Diarrhea: The etiology of the patient's diarrhea is unclear. It could be related to bowel edema in the setting of right heart failure or other causes. Monitoring for/treatment of electrolyte abnormalities, guaiac stools, and continued monitoring of"

   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9. However, OMR review reveals worsening of the
   patient's renal fxn over the past few months. FeUrea was consistent
   with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and renal ultrasound more
   consistent with intrinsic renal cause.  Creatinine has remained stable
   throughout CCU stay thus far.  Renal u/s only revealed bilateral renal
   cysts.

   #. CHF: Bedside echo revealed borderline RV function, and the patient
   does exhibit signs of right-sided HF on exam. Echo showed moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as well as
   pleural effusions.  As above, there is concern for possible
   infiltrative process (such as amyloidosis).

He has been in the ICU since [**2120-1-28**] and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 56 bpm (normal range 56-93 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 82/47 mmHg to 98/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute (normal range 10-22 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular block.

The patient's physical examination reveals general alertness, normal cardiac sounds without murmurs or gallops, bronchial breath sounds throughout, no notable crackles heard, non-tender abdomen with somewhat distended bowel sounds present, no masses appreciated, and pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities to the thighs. Some tense pulsatile purpura is noted in the distal right lower extremity.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.3 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, blood glucose of 126 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, and a troponin-T level of 0.21 ng/mL. Other lab values include an elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L, low albumin of 2.5 g/dL, slightly elevated lactic acid, and normal liver function tests.

The patient's medical conditions include hypotension with unclear etiology, acute on chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure, lower extremity edema, diarrhea, elevated troponin levels, microcytic anemia, COPD, vitamin B12 deficiency, and a history of ethanol abuse.

The patient has been on various medications including heparin sodium, atorvastatin, aspirin, lasix, and diuretics. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently in the ICU."

   #. Hypotension: Intermittent.  Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] EKG voltage in
   limb leads raises the possibility of an infiltrative process such as
   amyloidosis. However, Swan-Ganz values c/w possible sepsis.
   Endomyocardial biopsy deferred yesterday.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test yesterday
   evening showed  blunted response.  Potentially, hypotension represents
   adrenal insufficiency.

   - d/w endocrine further w/u for adrenal insufficiency
   - d/c antibiotics at this point, as pt does not appear infected
   - consider thoracentesis if above w/u does not reveal anything
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9. However, OMR review reveals worsening of the
   patient's renal fxn over the past few months. FeUrea was consistent
   with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and renal ultrasound more
   consistent with intrinsic renal cause.  Creatinine has remained stable
   throughout CCU stay thus far.  Renal u/s only revealed bilateral renal
   cysts.
   - f/u UPEP and SPEP
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #. CHF: Bedside echo revealed borderline RV function, and the patient
   does exhibit signs of right-sided HF on exam. Echo showed moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as well as
   pleural effusions.  As above, there is concern for possible
   infiltrative process (such as amyloidosis).
   - low-dose lasix gtt with goal diuresis of
   -1L
   - low salt diet
   - fat pad bx today to look for potential amyloidosis

   #. Lower extremity edema: Likely a consequence of heart failure as well
   as hypoalbuminemia.
   - LENI to evaluate r/o DVT

   diarrhea
   - f/u nutrition recs
   .
   #. Diarrhea: Etiology unclear.  Non-bloody, and C. diff negative.  No
   further episodes of diarrhea overnight.
   - continue to monitor stool output
   .
   #. Elevated Troponin: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but
   troponins are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable.
   - maintain active T&S

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted for an exacerbation of CHF. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent hypotension with unclear etiology. Possible causes could be sepsis or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened over the past few months, indicating a decline in renal function. There is evidence of both pre-renal and intrinsic renal causes. Close monitoring and follow-up with renal recommendations are necessary.

3. CHF: The patient exhibits signs of right-sided heart failure and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Management includes diuretics, low-salt diet, and consideration for fat pad biopsy to evaluate for potential infiltrative processes such as amyloidosis.

4. Lower extremity edema: This is likely a consequence of heart failure and hypoalbuminemia. Further evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is recommended, and measures to reduce fluid retention should be implemented.

5. Diarrhea: The etiology of the patient's diarrhea is unclear. Monitoring stool output and evaluating nutritional recommendations are advised.

6. Elevated Troponin: Although there is some elevation in troponin levels, it is unlikely"

   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. No evidence of infection to raise
   concern for sepsis.
   - attempt to wean pressors as tolerated
   - continue midodrine
   - f/u micro data; NGTD
   - f/u endocrine recs
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9. However, OMR review reveals worsening of the
   patient's renal fxn over the past few months. FeUrea was consistent
   with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and renal ultrasound are
   suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause. Amyloidosis is likely the
   underlying process. Creatinine has remained stable throughout CCU stay.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.
   - lasix gtt with goal diuresis of -1L
   - low salt diet
   - fat pad bx Friday to look for potential amyloidosis
   .
   #. Coronaries: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but troponins
   are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable.
   - maintain active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - rechecking iron studies per renal recs
   - continue iron supplementation
   .
   # COPD: Continue nebs PRN
   .
   # Vit B12 Deficiency: Continue supplementation
   .
   # H/O ETOH Abuse: Per pt, he has not used alcohol in 3 months.
   - no CIWA at this time; can consider if pt develops signs of withdrawal
   - continue MVI, thiamine, and folate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, and COPD, admitted for a heart failure exacerbation. The patient has been experiencing hypotension likely due to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of possible amyloidosis. There is also evidence of acute on chronic renal failure with worsening renal function over the past few months. The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure and peripheral edema, along with pulmonary hypertension. There is concern for an infiltrative process such as amyloidosis. The patient's coronary arteries are not significantly blocked, and he has microcytic anemia. The patient's COPD is being managed with nebs as needed, and he is also being treated for vitamin B12 deficiency and a history of ethanol abuse. The patient is currently receiving ICU care and has various lines and prophylactic treatments in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may continue if the underlying cause, such as autonomic dysfunction or possible amyloidosis, is not properly addressed. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicating a potential progression of kidney damage. If left untreated, this can result in further renal impairment and the need for dialysis or renal transplantation.

3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure/Peripheral Edema: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and COPD. He was admitted for a CHF exacerbation. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema, potential coronary artery disease, microcytic anemia, COPD, vitamin B12 deficiency, and a history of ethanol abuse.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate 59 bpm (with a range of 58-64 bpm), blood pressure 97/53 mmHg (with a range of 64-112/45-71 mmHg), respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 11-19 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,379 mL (with 623 mL IVF), output of 480 mL PO and 360 mL TF, with a total output of 4,580 mL (including 800 mL blood products). There is a negative fluid balance of -3,201 mL. The patient's lungs have decreased breath sounds at the bases, and he has pitting edema in both lower extremities up to the thighs.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH),

   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. No evidence of infection to raise
   concern for sepsis.
   - attempt to wean pressors as tolerated
   - continue midodrine; increase to 10 mg TID as pt still has pressor
   requirement
   - f/u micro data; NGTD
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - fat pad biopsy tomorrow to look for amyloidosis
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9.  Improved to 2.0 today. However, OMR review
   reveals worsening of the patient's renal fxn over the past few months.
   FeUrea was consistent with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and
   renal ultrasound are suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause.
   Amyloidosis is likely the underlying process. Creatinine has remained
   stable throughout CCU stay.
   - f/u renal recs
   - fat pad biopsy tomorrow to look for amyloidosis
   - change omperazole to ranitidine, as there could be some component of
   AIN [**12-26**] omeprazole
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.
   - lasix diuresis slowed yesterday, as pt became hyponatremia
   - continue diuresis with a goal of -1to2 L
   - low salt diet
   - fat pad bx Friday to look for potential amyloidosis
   .
   #. Coronaries: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but troponins
   are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable. Iron studies showed low iron with borderline low TIBC and
   ferritin.
   - maintain active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue iron supplementation
   .
   # COPD: Continue nebs PRN
   .
   # Vit B12 Deficiency: Continue supplementation
   .
   # H/O ETOH Abuse: Per pt, he has not used alcohol in 3 months.
   - no CIWA at this time; can consider if pt develops signs of withdrawal
   - continue MVI, thiamine, and folate

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted for CHF exacerbation. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema, possible infiltrative process such as amyloidosis, coronary artery disease, microcytic anemia, COPD, vitamin B12 deficiency, and history of ethanol abuse.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 97/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on phenylephrine infusion and furosemide for blood pressure management and diuresis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 195 K/uL, and elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL. Other lab results show hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered wheezes, bronchial breath sounds bilaterally, non-tender abdomen with somewhat distended bowel sounds, and pitting edema in the lower extremities"

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing ongoing hypotension, which may be related to autonomic dysfunction and possible amyloidosis. The patient is currently on midodrine, a medication used to treat low blood pressure.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened over the past few months, indicating a decline in renal function. There is suspicion of an intrinsic renal cause, possibly related to amyloidosis. Further evaluation and management of renal function is recommended.

3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure/Peripheral Edema: The patient has evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure, as shown by moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, increased PCWP, pleural effusions, and mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension was also noted. The patient's low limb lead voltages on EKG are consistent with an infiltrative process, such as amyloidosis. Diuretic therapy is ongoing, and a fat pad biopsy is planned to look for potential amyloidosis.

4. Coronaries: The patient has some Tn elevation, but troponins are flat and CK normal, making it unlikely to be related to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the patient is already on atorvastatin and aspirin for coronary artery disease prevention.

5. Microcytic Anemia: The patient has evidence of iron deficiency anemia, with low iron levels, borderline low TIBC, and low ferritin. Ongoing monitoring and management of iron supplementation is necessary.

6. COPD: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and nebulizer treatments are being continued as needed.

7. Vitamin B12 Deficiency: The patient has a deficiency in vitamin B12, and supplementation is ongoing.

8. History of ETOH Abuse: Although the patient reports no alcohol use in the past three months, there is a history of ethanol abuse. Withdrawal symptoms should be monitored, and continued supplementation with multivitamins, thiamine, and folate is recommended.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications in order to optimize the patient's overall health and well-being."

   admitted for CHF exacerbation.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. No evidence of infection to raise
   concern for sepsis.
   - attempt to wean pressors as tolerated
   - continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose
   - f/u micro data; NGTD
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - fat pad biopsy today to look for amyloidosis
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9.  Improved to 2.0 today. However, OMR review
   reveals worsening of the patient's renal fxn over the past few months.
   FeUrea was consistent with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and
   renal ultrasound are suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause.
   Amyloidosis is likely the underlying process. AIN considered in Ddx in
   setting of urine eosinophils. Omeprazole changed to ranitidine.
   Creatinine has remained stable throughout CCU stay.
   - f/u renal recs
   - fat pad biopsy today to look for amyloidosis
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.
   - continue diuresis with a goal of -1 to 2 L
   - low salt diet
   - fat pad bx today to look for potential amyloidosis
   .
   #. Coronaries: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but troponins
   are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Monoclonal gammopathy: Patient has IgA kappa monoclonal gammopathy.
   Unclear if he also has amyloidosis and/or myeloma.
   - fat pad biopsy
   - heme/onc consult when appropriate
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable. Iron studies showed low iron with borderline low TIBC and
   ferritin.  Monoclonal gammopathy may also be contributing to anemia if
   patient has myeloma.

","Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF) admitted for exacerbation of CHF. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema, coronary artery disease, monoclonal gammopathy, microcytic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and history of ethanol abuse.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a somewhat blunted cortisol response, but there is no evidence of infection to raise concern for sepsis. However, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

2. Progression of renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have remained stable throughout the CCU stay, but there is worsening renal function over the past few months. It is important to continue monitoring the renal function and further evaluate the underlying cause of renal failure.

3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP as seen on echo and cardiac catheterization. This indicates possible diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Close monitoring and management of pulmonary pressures are necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF) admitted for a CHF exacerbation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues.

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis. Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has adrenal insufficiency. The patient is on midodrine and there is no evidence of infection to raise concern for sepsis. The plan is to attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose, follow micro data; NGTD, and follow endocrine recommendations.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine on admission was 2.2 with a recent baseline of 1.9. It has improved to 2.0 today. However, OMR review reveals worsening of the patient's renal function over the past few months. FeUrea was consistent with a pre-renal state.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH),
   admitted for CHF exacerbation.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. No evidence of infection to raise
   concern for sepsis.
   - attempt to wean pressors as tolerated
   - continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose
   - f/u micro data; NGTD
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - fat pad biopsy today to look for amyloidosis
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9.  Improved to 2.0 today. However, OMR review
   reveals worsening of the patient's renal fxn over the past few months.
   FeUrea was consistent with a pre-renal state. However, proteinuria and
   renal ultrasound are suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause.
   Amyloidosis is likely the underlying process. AIN considered in Ddx in
   setting of urine eosinophils. Omeprazole changed to ranitidine.
   Creatinine has remained stable throughout CCU stay.
   - f/u renal recs
   - fat pad biopsy today to look for amyloidosis
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.
   - continue diuresis with a goal of -1 to 2 L
   - low salt diet
   - fat pad bx today to look for potential amyloidosis
   .
   #. Coronaries: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but troponins
   are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Monoclonal gammopathy: Patient has IgA kappa monoclonal gammopathy.
   Unclear if he also has amyloidosis and/or myeloma.
   - fat pad biopsy
   - heme/onc consult when appropriate
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable. Iron studies showed low iron with borderline low TIBC and
   ferritin.  Monoclonal gammopathy may also be contributing to anemia if
   patient has myeloma.
   - maintain active T&S
   - transfuse for goal Hct<21
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue iron supplementation
   .
   # COPD: Continue nebs PRN
   .
   # Vit B12 Deficiency: Continue supplementation
   .
   # H/O ETOH Abuse: Per pt, he has not used alcohol in 3 months.
   - no CIWA at this time; can consider if pt develops signs of withdrawal
   - continue MVI, thiamine, and folate

","Based on the provided physician's progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF). He was admitted for a CHF exacerbation. 

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension likely due to autonomic dysfunction, which could be related to possible [Doctor Last Name] amyloidosis. Cortisol stimulation showed a somewhat blunted response, but the endocrine team does not feel that the patient has adrenal insufficiency. The patient is on midodrine and there is no evidence of infection to raise concern for sepsis. 

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level on admission of 2.2 and a recent baseline of 1.9.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted for a CHF exacerbation. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is currently on levo with a wean plan. He has tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is being treated with Flagyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has decreased breath sounds at the bases and pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities. These findings suggest possible impaired skin integrity due to poor circulation and fluid retention.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be related to autonomic dysfunction or possible amyloidosis. The medical team is monitoring his volume status and providing appropriate treatment.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is likely related to autonomic dysfunction and possible amyloidosis. Clostridium difficile infection has been ruled out, and the patient is being monitored for any signs of infection.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been stable, indicating that his renal function has remained relatively unchanged during his ICU stay. However, there is a history of worsening renal function over the past few months, and further evaluation is needed.
5. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted for a congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, diarrhea, acute on chronic renal failure, diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema, possible infiltrative process such as amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy, microcytic anemia, and vit B12 deficiency.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which could be related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of possible amyloidosis. The patient is currently on midodrine and levo, but if the hypotension persists, dopamine may be started instead.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has developed diarrhea, likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of possible amyloidosis. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection has been confirmed, and the patient is being treated with Flagyl.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have shown worsening over the past few months, indicating a decline in renal function. This could be due to an intrinsic renal cause, possibly related to amyloidosis. Further evaluation is needed.
4. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH),
   admitted for CHF exacerbation.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. Continued hypotension with
   withdrawal from pressors. Now has c.diff likely hospital acquired but
   sepsis remains unlikely the etiology of his hypotension. Pressors
   d/c
ed yesterday, only slightly hypotensive this morning (SBP 97).
   - continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose
   - holding pressors, restart dopa if pt develops symptomatic hypotension
   - f/u micro data
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - f/u results fat pad biopsy.
   .
   # Diarrhea: Pt found to be c.diff positive.
   - monitor volume status
   - continue flagyll.
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9.  Cr slightly increased to 2.3 today. OMR
   review reveals worsening of the patient's renal function over the past
   few months. FeUrea was consistent with a pre-renal state. However,
   proteinuria and renal ultrasound are suggestive of an intrinsic renal
   cause. Amyloidosis is likely the underlying process. AIN considered in
   Ddx in setting of urine eosinophils and omeprazole, changed to
   ranitidine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - f/u fat pat bx
   - can consider renal biopsy if fat pad bx does not reveal anything
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.
   - hold diuresis for now
   - low salt diet
   - f/u fat pad bx
   .
   #. Coronaries: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but troponins
   are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Monoclonal gammopathy: Patient has IgA kappa monoclonal gammopathy.
   Unclear if he also has amyloidosis and/or myeloma.
   - f/u fat pad biopsy
   - heme/onc consult when appropriate
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable. Iron studies showed low iron with borderline low TIBC and
   ferritin.  Monoclonal gammopathy may also be contributing to anemia if
   patient has myeloma. Hct has been relatively stable throughout
   hospitalization.
   - maintain active T&S
   - transfuse for goal Hct<21
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue iron supplementation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of decreased cardiac output and hypotension. Upon admission, the patient had decreased breath sounds at the bases, non-tender abdomen with mild distension, scrotal edema, and pitting edema in both lower extremities. The patient's initial vital signs included a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 97/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius.

The patient has been receiving heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis and an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood cultures were drawn on [**2120-1-30**] at 09:34 AM and 09:37 AM. Other lab values include elevated lactate levels, low albumin, and slightly elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and low oxygen saturation may indicate an ongoing infection. The presence of decreased breath sounds at the bases could suggest pneumonia, while the non-tender abdomen with mild distension may indicate intra-abdominal infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/75 mmHg to 104/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and a stress ulcer medication. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. However, there is an elevated level of lactate acid and lactic acid. The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy would be essential in preventing and treating this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheterization. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses, monitoring for signs of swelling or pain in the lower extremities, and administration of heparin as prophylaxis are important in preventing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of certain medications"

   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. Continued hypotension with
   withdrawal from pressors. Now has c.diff likely hospital acquired but
   sepsis remains unlikely the etiology of his hypotension.
   - continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose

   possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis. Cdiff positive./
   -monitor volume status
   -continue flagyll.
   -guaiac stools
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9.  Now stable at 2.0. However, OMR review
   reveals worsening of the patient's renal function over the past few
   months. FeUrea was consistent with a pre-renal state. However,
   proteinuria and renal ultrasound are suggestive of an intrinsic renal
   cause. Amyloidosis is likely the underlying process. AIN considered in
   Ddx in setting of urine eosinophils and omeprazole changed to
   ranitidine. Creatinine has remained stable throughout CCU stay.
   - f/u renal recs
   - f/u path.
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.
   - hold diuresis for now
   - low salt diet
   - f/u fat pad bx
   .
   #. Coronaries: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but troponins
   are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Monoclonal gammopathy: Patient has IgA kappa monoclonal gammopathy.
   Unclear if he also has amyloidosis and/or myeloma.
   - f/u fat pad biopsy
   - heme/onc consult when appropriate
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable. Iron studies showed low iron with borderline low TIBC and
   ferritin.  Monoclonal gammopathy may also be contributing to anemia if
   patient has myeloma.
   - maintain active T&S

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted for a CHF exacerbation. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require ongoing management:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of possible amyloidosis. Cortisol stimulation showed a somewhat blunted response, but the endocrine team does not feel that the patient has adrenal insufficiency. The patient is on midodrine and continues to be hypotensive despite withdrawal from pressors. Now, he has Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection likely acquired in the hospital, but sepsis remains unlikely as the cause of his hypotension. The plan is to continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose, discontinue levo, and if hypotension persists or poor urine output occurs, start dopamine instead.

2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is also likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting of possible amyloidosis. He is positive for C. diff. The plan is to monitor volume status, continue Flagyl, and perform guaiac stool tests.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level on admission was 2.2, with a recent baseline of 1.9."

   74 y/o M with history of HTN, COPD, dCHF (last EF 55% with LVH),
   admitted for CHF exacerbation.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. Continued hypotension with
   withdrawal from pressors. Now has c.diff likely hospital acquired but
   sepsis remains unlikely the etiology of his hypotension. Has had
   decreased blood pressure and low urine output since pressors d/c
   - continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose
   - holding pressors for now; will bolus with fluids to see if this helps
   urine output
   - f/u micro data: no new data
   - f/u results fat pad biopsy
   .
   # Diarrhea: Pt found to be c.diff positive.
   - monitor volume status
   - continue flagyl
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9.  Cr increased to 2.5 today. FeUrea consistent
   with a pre-renal cause of this increase, although ATN is also possible.
   With regard to the more chronic process, OMR review reveals worsening
   of the patient's renal function over the past few months. Proteinuria
   and renal ultrasound are suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause.
   Amyloidosis may be the underlying process. AIN considered in Ddx in
   setting of urine eosinophils and omeprazole, changed to ranitidine.
   - fluid challenge to see if this improves creatinine/urine output
   - f/u renal recs
   - f/u fat pat bx
   - can consider renal biopsy if fat pad bx does not reveal anything
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.
   - hold diuresis for now
   - low salt diet
   - f/u fat pad bx
   .
   #. Coronaries: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but troponins
   are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Monoclonal gammopathy: Patient has IgA kappa monoclonal gammopathy.
   Unclear if he also has amyloidosis and/or myeloma.
   - f/u fat pad biopsy
   - heme/onc consult when appropriate
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable. Iron studies showed low iron with borderline low TIBC and
   ferritin.  Monoclonal gammopathy may also be contributing to anemia if
   patient has myeloma. Hct has been relatively stable throughout
   hospitalization.
   - maintain active T&S
   - transfuse for goal Hct<21
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue iron supplementation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was admitted for a CHF exacerbation.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, likely related to autonomic dysfunction or possible amyloidosis. The patient is on midodrine and has had withdrawal from pressors. It is recommended to continue midodrine at 10 mg TID and monitor for any changes.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has tested positive for C. diff, which is likely hospital-acquired. The patient should be monitored for volume status, continue with flagyl, and guaiac stools should be monitored.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 2.2 to 2.5, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to pre-renal causes or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's long-term renal function has also shown a chronic process, with proteinuria and renal ultrasound suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause, possibly amyloidosis. AIN should be considered if urine eosinophils are present. Fluid challenge should be done to assess creatinine and urine output. Renal recommendations, fat pad"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF) admitted for CHF exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications including acute renal failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired transfers, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing decreased blood pressure and low urine output since the discontinuation of pressors. He also has a history of monoclonal gammopathy, iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin B12 deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened over the past few months, with a recent creatinine level of 2.5 and the presence of granular casts on urine sediment. Further evaluation, including a renal biopsy, is recommended to determine the underlying cause.

2. C. diff Infection: The patient has tested positive for C. diff, a common hospital-acquired infection that causes severe diarrhea and can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension despite treatment with midodrine. Autonomic dysfunction and possible amyloidosis may be contributing factors. Continued monitoring and adjustment of treatment are necessary.

4. CHF/Peripheral Edema: The patient's diastolic heart failure has resulted in peripheral edema and"

   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. Continued hypotension with
   withdrawal from pressors. Now has c.diff likely hospital acquired but
   sepsis remains unlikely the etiology of his hypotension. Has had
   decreased blood pressure and low urine output since pressors d/c
   - continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose
   - holding pressors for now; will bolus with fluids to see if this helps
   urine output
   - f/u micro data: no new data
   - f/u results fat pad biopsy
   .
   # Diarrhea: Pt found to be c.diff positive.
   - monitor volume status
   - continue flagyl
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2 with
   a recent baseline of 1.9.  Cr increased to 2.5 today. FeUrea consistent
   with a pre-renal cause of this increase, although ATN is also possible.
   With regard to the more chronic process, OMR review reveals worsening
   of the patient's renal function over the past few months. Proteinuria
   and renal ultrasound are suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause.
   Amyloidosis may be the underlying process. AIN considered in Ddx in
   setting of urine eosinophils and omeprazole, changed to ranitidine.
   - fluid challenge to see if this improves creatinine/urine output
   - f/u renal recs
   - f/u fat pat bx
   - can consider renal biopsy if fat pad bx does not reveal anything
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.
   - hold diuresis for now
   - low salt diet
   - f/u fat pad bx
   .
   #. Coronaries: The patient does have some Tn elevation, but troponins
   are flat and CK normal. Unlikely to be related to ACS.
   - continue atorvastatin and aspirin
   .
   #. Monoclonal gammopathy: Patient has IgA kappa monoclonal gammopathy.
   Unclear if he also has amyloidosis and/or myeloma.
   - f/u fat pad biopsy
   - heme/onc consult when appropriate
   .
   #. Microcytic Anemia: Recent iron studies in [**2119-12-25**], show evidence of
   iron deficiency anemia. Colonoscopy in [**2114**] was normal.  Hematocrit has
   been stable. Iron studies showed low iron with borderline low TIBC and
   ferritin.  Monoclonal gammopathy may also be contributing to anemia if
   patient has myeloma. Hct has been relatively stable throughout
   hospitalization.
   - maintain active T&S
   - transfuse for goal Hct<21

","The patient is a 70-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of decreased urine output and hypotension. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic diastolic heart failure, anemia, and other medical conditions. 

Upon admission, the patient was alert and oriented. Vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/50 mmHg to 103/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient was given intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but did not respond to the fluid resuscitation. 

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating renal impairment. The patient also had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 184 K/uL. Other lab values were within normal limits, except for elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's physical examination revealed pitting edema in the lower extremities, bronchial breath sounds bilaterally, and a mildly distended abdomen. 

The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance impairment,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, anemia, and renal failure admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is low urine output. The patient received two boluses of normal saline but did not respond. The EKG showed sinus rhythm, and renal recommendations include continuing fluids, following up with a fat pad biopsy, and possibly needing a renal biopsy. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole at 04:15 PM. The patient is on heparin sodium prophylaxis since 04:00 PM. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for low urine output. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 60 bpm with a range of 53-73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/50 mmHg to 103/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute with a range of 10-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 84.6 kg, which is slightly less than their admission weight of 84.8 kg. The patient has received a total of 2,140 mL of fluids, with 1,000 mL given intravenously. The patient has had a total output of 355 mL of urine and received 500 cc NS x 2, with no response to the second bolus. The patient is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula and has been on respiratory support. 

Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels and abnormal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other lab results indicate abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired transfers, C. difficile infection, hypotension (not in shock), chronic anemia, chronic diastolic heart failure, and potential complications such as acute kidney injury, sepsis, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure leading to further electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances, sepsis due to C. difficile infection, development of pressure ulcers or deep vein thrombosis due to impaired mobility, and cardiac complications related to chronic diastolic heart failure."

   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. Continued hypotension with
   withdrawal from pressors. Now has c.diff likely hospital acquired but
   sepsis remains unlikely the etiology of his hypotension. Has had
   decreased blood pressure and low urine output  as he has poor
   vasculator tone and intrinsic renal disease (possibly amyloid)
   exacerbated by chronic renal failure .
   - continue midodrine at 10 mg TID dose
   - volume expansion as tolerated/
   - f/u micro data: no new data
   - f/u results fat pad biopsy
   f/u renal recs
   .
    #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2
   with a recent baseline of 1.9.  Cr stable at 2.5 at the moment. Urine
   output currently not responding well with fluid challenge. FeNa 0.1
   consistent with a pre-renal  which likely progressed to ATN given
   presence of granular casts on urine sediment. With regard to the more
   chronic process, OMR review reveals worsening of the patient's renal
   function over the past few months. Proteinuria and renal ultrasound are
   suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause. Amyloidosis may be the
   underlying process. AIN considered in Ddx in setting of urine
   eosinophils and omeprazole, changed to ranitidine. Pt has received 2L
   *ie half his blood volume) with no increase in his bp, minimal
   improvement in UOP.
   - volume expansion as tolerated,.
   - f/u fat pat bx
 if negative, renal bx as per renal recs
   - can consider renal biopsy if fat pad bx does not reveal anything
   .
   # Diarrhea: Pt found to be c.diff positive.
   - monitor volume status
   - continue flagyl
   - guaiac stools
   # Bleeding: Known hemorrhoids versus secondary to c.diff (less likely)
   Continue to trend HCT
   Guaic all stools.
   Maintain active T and S.
   .
   #. Diastolic congestive heart failure/peripheral edema: Echo showed
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased PCWP, as
   well as pleural effusions.  Cardiac catheterization showed mild
   biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
   hypertension.  As above, there is concern for possible infiltrative
   process (such as amyloidosis). Low limb lead voltages on EKG are
   consistent with this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. He was admitted for CHF exacerbation and is currently in the ICU. The patient's main issues include renal failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired transfers, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), hypotension, anemia, and monoclonal gammopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. There is a possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the presence of granular casts in the urine sediment.

2. C. diff Colitis: The patient has tested positive for C. diff infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension, which may be related to autonomic dysfunction or possible amyloidosis. He is currently on midodrine and volume expansion.

4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause. Iron deficiency anemia has been identified, but monoclonal gammopathy may also contribute to anemia if the patient has myeloma.

5. Monoclonal Gammopathy: The"

   #. Hypotension: Likely related to autonomic dysfunction in the setting
   of possible [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloidosis.  Cortisol stimulation showed somewhat
   blunted response, but endocrine does not feel that the patient has
   adrenal insufficiency. On midodrine. Continued hypotension with
   withdrawal from pressors. Now has c.diff likely hospital acquired but
   sepsis remains unlikely the etiology of his hypotension. Has had
   decreased blood pressure and low urine output since pressors d/c

   - f/u results fat pad biopsy
   .
    #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine on admission was 2.2
   with a recent baseline of 1.9.  Cr stable at 2.5 at the moment. Urine
   output currently not responding well with fluid challenge. FeNa 0.1
   consistent with a pre-renal  which likely progressed to ATN given
   presence of granular casts on urine sediment. With regard to the more
   chronic process, OMR review reveals worsening of the patient's renal
   function over the past few months. Proteinuria and renal ultrasound are
   suggestive of an intrinsic renal cause. Amyloidosis may be the
   underlying process. AIN considered in Ddx in setting of urine
   eosinophils and omeprazole, changed to ranitidine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF) admitted for an exacerbation of CHF. He has been experiencing hypotension, renal failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, and impaired transfers. The patient also has a history of anemia, other heart failure (CHF), and monoclonal gammopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent low blood pressure may be due to autonomic dysfunction possibly related to amyloidosis. The patient has been started on midodrine, but continues to have hypotension even after discontinuing pressors. Another IV fluid challenge or blood transfusion may be considered to address this issue.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 2.2 on admission to 2.5 currently, indicating worsening renal function. The urine output is not responding well to fluid challenges, and the presence of granular casts in the urine sediment suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the renal failure, and a renal biopsy may be necessary if the fat pad biopsy does not reveal any significant findings.
