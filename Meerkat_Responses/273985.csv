","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for an exacerbation of multiple sclerosis. She is currently intubated and sedated due to altered mental status (AMS) while receiving chemotherapy as per neurology recommendations. The patient's medical history includes a previous reaction to cyclophosphamide, resulting in hematuria, and she is also currently experiencing hematuria. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1째C, heart rate ranging from 89-170 bpm, blood pressure between 129/70 mmHg and 139/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,934 mL and output of 1,100 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, lorazepam, haloperidol, heparin, and various others. 

Physical examination reveals diminished radial and digital pulses, symmetric chest expansion with diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, and warm skin. Neurologic examination is not assessable due to sedation. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Imaging reveals a chest X-ray with an endotr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, for which she has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. She is currently sedated and receiving chemotherapy for her concentric sclerosis exacerbation. The patient's medical history includes allergies to prednisone, sulfa, and phenytoin sodium. Her current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, lorazepam, haloperidol, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. VAP prophylaxis measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory system batch interface (RSBI) monitoring should be implemented.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is at risk of delirium or confusion due to sedation and chemotherapy. Close monitoring and sedation management are necessary.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis likely secondary to steroids. Monitoring for localizing signs of infection and fever is important.

4. Hematuria/Cystitis: The patient is at risk for hematuria or cystitis, especially since she is receiving cyclophosphamide, which has caused a similar reaction"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y/o woman with concentric sclerosis now complicated by agitation,
   delirium, and respiratory failure.
   - Today, we will get PICC line (likely more stable than an IJ central
   line if she is agitated).
   - Once vascular access is secured, will attempt to lighten sedation and
   assess underlying status.  Ventilator weaning/liberation to follow this
   assessment.
   - Cytoxan, steroids, and MESNA per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Follow for cystitis,
   hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, etc.
   - we will follow leukocytosis (likely secondary to steroids) and anemia
   - begin transitioning sedation to shorter-acting

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y/o woman with concentric sclerosis now complicated by agitation,
   delirium, and respiratory failure.
   - Today, we will get PICC line (likely more stable than an IJ central
   line if she is agitated).
   - Once vascular access is secured, will attempt to lighten sedation and
   assess underlying status.  Ventilator weaning/liberation to follow this
   assessment.
   - Cytoxan, steroids, and MESNA per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Follow for cystitis,
   hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, etc.
   - we will follow leukocytosis (likely secondary to steroids) and anemia

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of concentric sclerosis, currently experiencing agitation, delirium, and respiratory failure. She is sedated and unable to provide her own medical history. The patient has been receiving various medications including cytoxan, steroids, and MESNA, as per Dr. [Last Name (Title)]. She has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, with arterial and multi-lumen lines inserted. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a high white blood cell count, likely secondary to the use of steroids. Her laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium and glucose, along with low calcium and magnesium. The patient's chest X-ray reveals possible pulmonary edema and hilar fullness. The plan is to attempt to lighten sedation, assess her underlying status, and wean her off the ventilator if possible. The patient will be closely monitored for complications such as cystitis, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
3. Stress ulcer
4. Cystitis
5. Hypokalemia
6. Hyperglycemia
7. Leukocytosis

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman who is currently intubated and sedated for acute mental status changes (AMS) while receiving chemotherapy per neurology recommendations. She has a diagnosis of concentric sclerosis and is being treated with cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone, and may also undergo plasmapheresis. The patient's respiratory function is compromised, with a recent RSBI of 15. She also has leukocytosis and a history of bloody urine. The patient is overweight/obese, has diminished breath sounds bilaterally at the bases, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/102 to 139/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's RSBI of 15 indicates potential respiratory failure, although it is not ARDS. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to support her respiratory function.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is at risk for delirium or confusion, especially once off the ventilator. Managing with prn haldol and benzo will be required.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could indicate an underlying infection. Monitoring for localizing signs of infection and fever is crucial"

   -          continue methylprednisolone q24h x 5 day course per neuro
   recs
   -          MRI brain today to assess for cerebral edema
   -          neuro also recommending plasmapheresis, will c/s blood bank
   -          d/c bladder irrigation as she had hematuria prior to

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis who developed severe delirium and required intubation for management. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute delirium, leukocytosis, and tachycardia.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

2. Infection: Prolonged intubation and immobility increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge.

4. Delirium: The patient is currently experiencing severe delirium, which may require ongoing sedation and may impact her ability to wean off mechanical ventilation.

5. Neurological complications: Concentric sclerosis is a progressive neurological disorder, and the patient's neurological status has not improved with immunosuppression so far. There is a risk of further neurological decline.

6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored due to concerns about hypov"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with hypoxia not explained by volutrauma or pneumothorax. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or atelectasis causing the hypoxia. A bronchoscopy is planned to further investigate and rule out VAP.

2. Concentric Sclerosis: The patient is being treated for concentric sclerosis with immunosuppressive therapy, including cyclophosphamide, mesla, and cytoxan. Steroids are being tapered per neurologic recommendations, and plasmapheresis is scheduled for Friday. An MRI brain is also ordered.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium/confusion, likely due to underlying CNS pathology. Sedation with propofol and fentanyl will continue to manage this condition.

4. Hypotension: The patient had an episode of hypotension during plasma exchange, which responded to fluid resuscitation. This could be related to the large volume of plasma exchange.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increased white blood cell count but remains afebrile. Given the opacity in the right upper lobe, antibiotics will be started empirically, and cultures will be obtained.

6. Depression: The patient has a history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have a history of respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, concentric sclerosis, delirium/confusion, hypotension (not shock), leukocytosis, depression, and are replete with fiber nutrition. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1째C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/32 mmHg to 164/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and sinus tachycardia as their heart rhythm. The patient's current weight is 129.9 kg, and their height is 67 inches. The patient has undergone several procedures, including the placement of an arterial line, pheresis catheter, and multi-lumen catheter. They have also received multiple infusions and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition indicates acute respiratory failure. It is essential to closely monitor their oxygenation levels, ABG results, and any changes in their respiratory status. Measures should be taken to optimize ventilation and oxygenation, such as adjusting PEEP and FiO2 as necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The increasing loss of transparency in the right upper lobe seen on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of developing pneumonia. This requires further investigation through sputum cultures and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis leading to respiratory failure. The major new finding today is possible right upper lobe (RUL) volume loss versus developing RUL pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of concentric sclerosis. Complications related to respiratory failure can include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further deterioration in lung function.

2. RUL Volume Loss vs. Developing RUL Pneumonia: If the patient develops pneumonia, she may experience symptoms such as increased cough, production of purulent sputum, fever, and worsening oxygenation. If the volume loss progresses, it could lead to further respiratory compromise.

3. Concentric Sclerosis: Treatment for concentric sclerosis may include cytoxan, plasmapheresis, and steroids. Complications associated with these treatments could be immune system suppression, which increases the risk of infections, and potential adverse effects of the medications such as kidney damage, bone marrow suppression, and increased susceptibility to infections.

4. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient experienced hypotension, which has now stabilized. If hypotension recurs or persists, it could lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential multi-organ dysfunction.

5. ICU Care: The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) and concentric sclerosis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute mental status changes (AMS) and sedation while undergoing chemotherapy. The patient initially required intubation for airway protection and is now being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS/Doctor's Last Name): The patient was intubated for airway protection during sedation and now requires ongoing management for VAP. The plan is to continue with the current antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/cipro), follow-up BAL culture, rule out Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and wean down PEEP as tolerated.
2. Concentric Sclerosis: The patient has a history of MS with concentric sclerosis. The management plan includes neuro and oncology input, continuation of cyclophosphamide and mesla, tapering steroids per neuro recommendations, plasmapheresis, and monitoring with MRI brain.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium/confusion is likely due to underlying CNS pathology and occasional sinus tachycardia. Sedation with propofol and fentanyl will be continued.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to steroids but may mask the response to underlying infection. Pan cultures will"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of concentric sclerosis, admitted for altered mental status (AMS) and sedation during chemotherapy. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed improvement in multiple lesions and ruled out PCP and other respiratory viral antigens. She was intubated for airway protection and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is receiving appropriate antibiotics tailored to the results of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture. If no growth is observed by Sunday, all VAP antibiotics may be discontinued.

The patient also has leukocytosis, likely due to steroids, and delirium/confusion from underlying CNS pathology. She continues to be sedated with propofol and fentanyl to maintain IV access and pheresis line. Imaging studies reveal interval improvement in the brain lesions, consistent with multiple sclerosis (concentric type). The patient is scheduled for plasmapheresis today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and on mechanical ventilation. This risk is increased due to the presence of multiple risk factors such as being sedated, having a prolonged stay on mechanical ventilation, and having a history of recent chemotherapy.

2. Delirium/confusion: The patient's underlying CNS pathology, including her history of concent"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Good RSBI this AM with decreased FiO2 and PEEP requirements. Will try
   SBP today, review plans for extubation with neurology. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   remain intubated for remainder of pheresis and chemotherapy.
   CXR with improved RUL opacity, may have been [**1-2**] mucus plugging; has
   persistent pulmonary edema. Low p/f may benefit from further diuresis.
 POSSIBLE VAP
   Afebrile, WBC decreased. Sputum cultures with moderate S. aureus,
   speciation of which is still pending. Will continue current regimen of
   vancomycin/zosyn/ciprofloxacin today. Discontinue zosyn and
   ciprofloxacin if clinically improved  with no gram negatives grown from
   culture. Reculture if febrile, follow up cultures.
 CONCENTRIC SCLEROSIS
   Treatment per neurology, tx with cyclophosphamide. S/p plasmapheresis
   x2 plan for 5 treatments. Tapering steroids per neurology
   recommendations.
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Patient with significant agitation on floor prior to ICU continue
   sedation to allow completion of treatment.
 Urinary tract infection
   Change foley catheter, E. coli likely to be covered on current
   antibiotics. Follow up culture sensitivities.

","The patient is a 27-year-old female with concentric sclerosis, currently receiving treatment with chemotherapy and plasmapheresis. She is sedated and unable to provide any history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure. The patient has been weaned off PEEP and FiO2 and tolerated pheresis well. An arterial line has been placed, and she continues to be intubated for the remainder of pheresis and chemotherapy.

CXR shows left pleural effusion and increased right-sided patchy infiltrates. The ET tube tip is 3.4 cm above the carina, the right central venous line tip is in the distal SVC, and the NG tube is in the stomach.

Labs show elevated white blood cell count and neutrophils, with decreased hemoglobin, platelets, and albumin. Blood cultures are negative, but sputum cultures show moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is receiving antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient is being treated for concentric sclerosis with cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis, as well as tapering steroids. She also has delirium and confusion, possibly due to agitation prior to ICU admission.

Urinary tract infection is suspected, with a Foley catheter change planned, and E. coli coverage on current antibiotics.

ICU care includes nutrition on hold pending extubation, glycemic control with regular insulin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a diagnosis of concentric sclerosis. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and sedation while undergoing chemotherapy. The patient's hospital course is complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), concentric sclerosis, leukocytosis, delirium/confusion, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is an ongoing effort to wean her off the ventilator, but she remains at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has possible VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. Treatment involves broad-spectrum antibiotics based on the results of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture.
3. Concentric Sclerosis: The patient has a pre-existing condition called concentric sclerosis, which requires ongoing management including chemotherapy and plasmapheresis. Close coordination with neurology and oncology teams is necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to steroid treatment. This may mask the response to underlying infections and should be monitored closely.
5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, likely secondary to underlying CNS pathology. Sedation with propofol and fentanyl will be continued to maintain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of concentric sclerosis, intubated for altered mental status and now showing signs of improving mental status. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 736 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. Her blood gases show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 172, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 22.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. This is a common complication in patients who are intubated for an extended period of time. It is important to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function has deteriorated, leading to the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration, and extubation may be limited by mental status concerns.
3. Delirium/confusion: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 27-year-old female with concentric sclerosis who was intubated due to altered mental status and subsequently developed ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP). The patient's respiratory failure is acute and not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's leukocytosis is improving and may be attributed to VAP and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has hypotension, which could be caused by propofol, and delirium/confusion due to concentric sclerosis. The patient is being treated with pheresis and steroids for concentric sclerosis, as well as antibiotics for VAP. The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. This can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis if not promptly treated.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status and confusion can be attributed to concentric sclerosis. Delirium is a serious condition that can increase the risk of complications such as falls, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pressure ulcers.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to propofol administration. Hypotension can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications.

   obtain repeat sample.
   Suspect patient
s low p/f secondary to persistent pulmonary edema. Will
   diurese today with lasix goal 2liters negative as BP tolerates. Will
   change back to AC ventilation given large tidal volumes. Can increase
   PEEP if needed to support oxygenation.
 POSSIBLE VAP
   Afebrile, WBC decreased. Sputum with only S. aureus on cultures, would
   narrow to vancomycin only today and complete 8 day course of therapy.
   If decompensates, would add back zosyn and cipro for gram negative
   coverage.
 CONCENTRIC SCLEROSIS
   Treatment per neurology, tx with cyclophosphamide with last dose
   planned 2/18 per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Next pheresis [**1-18**]. Taping steroids per
   neurology recommendations.
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Patient with significant agitation on floor prior to ICU continue
   sedation to allow completion of treatment.
 Urinary tract infection
   On ampicillin for pan-sensitive E. coli UTI. Given catheter would
   complete 2 week course of treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with concentric sclerosis admitted to the ICU for chemotherapy and pheresis. She has been experiencing hypertension, agitation, and requiring significant sedation. She has allergies to prednisone, sulfa, and phenytoin. The patient is currently on several medications, including fentanyl and heparin. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.3째C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 141/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 818 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 100. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, trace edema in both extremities, and warm skin. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (26.3 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (10.0 g/dL), elevated blood glucose levels (ranging from 124 to 161 mg/dL), and elevated C-reactive protein (182"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 y/o F with concentric sclerosis and altered mental status, admitted
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for line placement and subsequently developed ARDS and VAP.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP):  Continue vancomycin
   for staph, presumed MRSA.  D/c zosyn and cipro as she has not grown any
   gram negatives from her sputum or BAL.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS):  Now meets criteria for ARDS with
   P:F around 100, bilateral interstitial infiltrates.  Likely due to VAP
   (staph) and volume overload.  Respiratory system compliance is about 60
   ml/cm H20, which argues against ARDS picture. Would transduce central
   line to get a sense of her filling pressures.
   - trial of lasix for goal I/O negative around 1-2 liters (is
   significantly positive this admission)
   - recheck ABG
   - switch back to AC given her increased tidal volumes are suboptimal in
   the setting of ARDS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of concentric sclerosis and altered mental status. She was admitted to the hospital for line placement and subsequently developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3째C (99.2째F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 128/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 780 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 124 to 152 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal small bilateral pleural effusions and interstitial edema on chest X-ray.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and is being treated with vancomycin. She also has acute respiratory failure due to ARDS, likely secondary to VAP and volume overload. The plan includes continuing van"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis admitted for chemotherapy and pheresis. The following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as obesity, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. There is concern for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The plan includes continuing airway pressures limited (AC) to prevent large tidal volumes, diuresis with lasix to achieve a goal of -2L, and switching to an arterial line to improve the ability to follow ABGs.

2. Ventilator Acquired Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia likely due to being on mechanical ventilation. The sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures have grown [Doctor Last Name 969], and the plan is to continue nafcillin coverage. If the patient worsens, additional gram-negative coverage may be necessary.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which is likely due to the administration of steroids. Since she is significantly agitated and delirious while receiving steroids on the floor, she is being kept on mechanical ventilation to facilitate treatment.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture has grown pan-sensitive E. coli, and the plan is to continue ciprofloxacin for a total of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis admitted for chemotherapy and pheresis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. She has been intubated and sedated, with ongoing mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4째C (99.4째F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 102/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's sputum culture grew pan-sensitive E. coli, and her urine culture grew pan-sensitive E. coli as well. Chest X-ray findings indicate cardiomegaly, low lung volumes, improvement in left lower lobe aeration, and consolidation in the right upper lobe. The patient's medical history includes allergies to prednisone, sulfa, and phenytoin sodium, as well as previous antibiotic use.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, indicating a possible VAP. This is supported by the presence of new fevers after changing antibiotics and the growth of pathogens"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of concentric sclerosis, admitted for chemotherapy and pheresis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute on chronic, caused by obesity, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. She is intubated and sedated, with a midline in place, and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/34-146/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. She has crackles in her right lower lobe and coarse bilateral breath sounds. Her abdomen is soft, with no tenderness or distension. She has mild lower extremity edema.

She has a central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. She has a fungal culture pending, as well as an acid-fast smear and culture. Her sputum culture grew gram-positive cocci, and her urine culture showed pan-sensitive E. coli. Her chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly with mild improvement in left lower lobe aeration, but right upper lobe consolidation is stable, and there is a new ill-defined opacity in the right lower lobe, which could be atelectasis or developing consolidation.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis admitted for chemotherapy and pheresis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, as indicated by the growth of bacteria in her sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures. This requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio is concerning for ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory status is essential.

3. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing agitation and delirium while receiving steroids, which may be contributing to her confusion. It is important to address this issue and provide appropriate sedation and analgesia to facilitate treatment.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture has grown pan-sensitive E. coli, indicating a UTI. She should continue receiving ciprofloxacin for a total of two weeks to treat the infection.

5. Concentric sclerosis: The patient has concentric sclerosis, a neurological condition that requires further evaluation and management by neurology. Pheresis is planned today to address this condition.

The patient is a 27-year-old female with concentric sclerosis admitted to the ICU for treatment. She underwent pheresis in the morning, following which her oxygenation steadily worsened. A bronchoscopic evaluation revealed no significant findings, but a CT angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but did reveal a right-to-left infiltrate concerning for aspiration pneumonia. The patient received cyclophosphamide and has shown improving oxygen saturation levels, allowing for weaning off oxygen.

The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. She has allergies to prednisone (psychosis), sulfa (rash), and phenytoin sodium (psychosis). Her last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.2째C (100.7째F) and current temperature of 37째C (98.6째F), heart rate between 61-124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/52 to 144/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has increased from 130.2 kg at admission to 178.2 kg currently.

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a chief complaint of concentric sclerosis. She underwent pheresis in the morning and her oxygenation steadily worsened. A bronchoscopic evaluation revealed no significant findings, but a computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a right-to-left infiltrate concerning for aspiration pneumonia. The patient received cyclophosphamide and her oxygen saturation levels are improving while weaning off oxygen. She is sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has allergies to prednisone, sulfa, and phenytoin sodium. She was on antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and zosyn. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new findings mentioned above.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. It is being managed by continuing AC (airway and ventilation support), diuresis with lasix, and frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) monitoring.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is developing pneumonia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). She will be switched back to vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. If she worsens, gram-negative coverage may be added.

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of concentric sclerosis, who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She underwent bronchoscopy and computed tomography angiography (CTA), which showed basilar atelectasis and pneumonia, but no pulmonary embolism. The patient has been treated with cytoxan and plasmapheresis for concentric sclerosis. Her WBC count has been decreasing, consistent with the effects of cytoxan. The patient also has pancytopenia, delirium/confusion related to concentric sclerosis, and altered mental status. She is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has VAP, which needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure needs ongoing monitoring and management, including weaning PEEP and continuing diuresis.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's decreasing WBC count indicates pancytopenia, which should be further evaluated and managed to prevent infection and bleeding complications.
4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium/confusion needs to be managed to improve her mental status and prevent further complications.
5. Concentric Sclerosis: The patient's underlying condition, concentric"

","The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of concentric sclerosis who has been admitted to the ICU. She has been treated with cytoxan and plasmapheresis. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her hypoxemia is consistent with basilar atelectasis and pneumonia rather than pulmonary embolism. She is also showing signs of pancytopenia, likely due to the cytoxan effect. The patient's delirium and confusion are related to her concentric sclerosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, leading to increased difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: With pancytopenia and evolving sepsis, the patient may develop systemic infection and septic shock.
3. Pneumonia progression: The VAP may worsen, leading to increased infiltrates on chest imaging and worsening gas exchange.
4. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to decrease, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, and ventilation parameters, as well as regularly assess her mental status and blood counts. Promptly addressing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old obese male with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. They have been on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has undergone plasmapheresis for concentric sclerosis and is currently receiving treatment for bacterial pneumonia, leukopenia, anemia, constipation, and urinary tract infection. The patient's condition is stable, but there are potential medical complications that can arise, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration pneumonia, and complications related to concentric sclerosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, is necessary. Early identification and prompt antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent progression.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's obesity and possible aspiration events, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring for symptoms like cough, fever, and worsening respiratory status is essential. Adequate aspiration precautions should be taken, including elevating the head of the bed and avoiding sedation that may impair swallowing.

3. Complications related to concentric sclerosis: The patient has been treated with plasmapheresis for concentric sclerosis. Although the treatment seems to be progressing well, there is a possibility of complications such as infection associated with the pheresis catheter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old overweight male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including leukemia, constipation, leukopenia, anemia, and concentric sclerosis. The patient is currently on various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, lansoprazole, heparin, and several antibiotics. The patient underwent plasmapheresis for concentric sclerosis and is scheduled for one more session. The patient's urine culture showed yeast infection, and their sputum culture indicated MSSA. The patient's respiratory status has improved with weaning off PEEP and reduction in ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, as well as regular sputum cultures, is essential.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's obesity, reduced level of consciousness, and inability to protect their airway increase the risk of aspiration. This could lead to pneumonia and worsen the patient's respiratory status.
3. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which may increase the risk of infections. Close monitoring of the white blood cell count and appropriate antibiotic coverage is necessary.
4. Constipation: The patient's use of fentanyl and lack of bowel movements put them at risk"

","The patient is a 67-year-old obese male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to aspiration pneumonia. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute liver injury, and delirium.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received one additional session of plasmapheresis and a steroid taper. His PEEP was weaned down, and he had one episode of small ""coffee ground"" nasogastric tube output. The patient is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain control, respectively. Other medications include lansoprazole, furosemide, and heparin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9째C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 133/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac output of 4.0 L/min and a urine output of 500 mL over the past 24 hours. Fluid balance reveals an intake of 4,048 mL and an output of 5,545 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,497 mL.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 152 to 177 mg/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.5 to 0.6 mg/dL. Other labs, including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and coagulation profile, are within normal limits.

Radiology images show stable mild pulmonary edema with interval improvement in right upper lobe pneumonia versus aspiration. Microbiology cultures indicate the presence of yeast in the urine and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the sputum.

The patient's clinical impression includes no evidence of obstruction on the imaging, high-density stool throughout the colon, and stable mild pulmonary edema with interval improvement in right upper lobe pneumonia versus aspiration. The patient remains at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and delirium.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and management are required to prevent further complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and concentric sclerosis. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide her own medical history. 

Key findings from the vital signs include a temperature of 37.1째C (98.8째F), heart rate of 107 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 121/81 mmHg to 133/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's weight has increased from 130.2 kg at admission to 178.2 kg currently.

The patient is receiving various medications including diuretics, antibiotics, and sedatives. The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative fluid intake of 2-3 liters over the past 24 hours.

The physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, normocephalic head, normal heart sounds, increased peripheral pulses, soft non-tender abdomen, and increased muscle tone with non-purposeful movements. Neurological examination shows midline pupils with coordinated movements. Skin assessment was not performed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.5 K/uL, increased platelet count (Plt) of 182 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.7%, decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 26"

   Tolerated plasmapheresis.
   Too sedated after this for extubation, although doing well on PSV 5 /
   PEEP 8.
   Discussed with nursing, respiratory, housestaff, and mother
 tonight
   major plan is to hold sedation and use propofol if needed.  We will
   then aim for RSBI
 SBT early tomorrow.  I would not favor extubation
   tonight given body habitus and relatively marginal pulmonary status.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and concentric sclerosis. She is currently in the ICU and has been sedated.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1째C (98.8째F), heart rate 107 bpm, blood pressure 121/81 mmHg, respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. Her weight has increased from 130.2 kg at admission to 178.2 kg currently.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and others. She has undergone plasmapheresis and received a course of cyclophosphamide (cytoxan).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 97 mg/dL to 177 mg/dL. Other lab values such as electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes, and coagulation profile are within normal limits.

Imaging shows an endotracheal tube positioned about 2 cm above the carina and better overall aeration, particularly in the right upper lobe when compared to previous days.

The patient's assessment and plan include improvement of respiratory failure, treatment of VAP with vancomycin, nafcillin,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. He has a history of obesity, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 50%, and PEEP 8 cmH2O. His vital signs include a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been diuresed well and is anticipated to have a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) this morning, allowing for weaning off propofol, switching to spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and potential extubation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial due to obesity, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The RSBI this morning was 35, indicating a possible readiness for weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. MSSA has been isolated from sputum cultures, and expanded coverage has been initiated after the patient developed fever and hypoxia while on nafcillin/ciprofloxacin. Aspiration is also a concern given the suctioning of feeds.
3. Neutropenia: The patient is neutropenic, likely secondary"

   tolerated would extubate
   -- prior to extubation would check a venous blood gas as difficult to
   assess underlying mental status
   -- would also continue to diurese goal -1
 2 liters (continues to
   autodiurese very well)
   -- treat pulmonary infection as below
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   -- MSSA isolated from sputum, but now on expanded coverage after fever
   and hypoxia with just naficillin/cipro.
   -- Continue zosyn/cipro/vancomycin for 8 day course,  today is day #4,
   can maintain cipro for UTI as below

","The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of concentric sclerosis, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a recent RSBI of 35, indicating that weaning off propofol and switching to spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) can be considered. The plan is to extubate the patient if well tolerated during SBT.

The patient has also been diagnosed with neutropenia due to chemotherapy, anemia, constipation, concentric sclerosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and DIC/hemolysis. Appropriate treatments and follow-up plans have been established for each condition.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as SQ UF Heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcer, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) for VAP prevention. The pheresis catheter will be removed today if the patient is stable after extubation.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

   VAP.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   - improved and seems to be tolerating SBT
   - check VBG, since we cannot assess her mental status well given
   underlying disease.  If OK --> trial of extubation (she was previously
   a Grade I view direct laryngoscopy)
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   - complete course of ABX (d/c after eight-day course)
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Concentric Sclerosis
   - no further rx at present
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   - secondary to concentric sclerosis
   - treat with Haldol peri-extubation if needed.  Could consider
   Precedex.
 NEUTROPENIA
   - secondary to cytoxan
   - discuss the role of GCSF with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and oncology

   Critical Care Attending Addendum
   Following extubation, Ms. [**Known lastname 913**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1079**] to the mid 80s, was very
   agitated, and had respiratory distress.  She nearly required
   reintubation.  We diuresed, placed a nasal trumpet, and moved her to a
   more-upright sitting position.  She was not responsive to Haldol and
   BZD, so we began Precedex, which has worked quite well.  VBG shows that
   she is maintaining pCO2 appropriately.  She may require reintubation
   tonight; we have discussed this with her mother in detail.  We will
   continue to follow VBGs overnight.
   She has a fever as well.  If she decompensates, would change to
   meropenem since this might cover ESBL-producing organisms. For now, we
   will continue current antibiotics.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- She has shown improvement in her respiratory failure and is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).
- The patient has been receiving antibiotics for VAP, and it is mentioned that she should complete an eight-day course of antibiotics before discontinuing them.
- Concentric sclerosis is present but not requiring further treatment at present.
- The patient is experiencing delirium/confusion secondary to concentric sclerosis. Treatment options include using Haldol peri-extubation and considering Precedex.
- She has neutropenia secondary to cytoxan, and the role of G-CSF should be discussed with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)] and oncology.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, but it seems to be improving as she tolerates SBT. However, there is a risk of respiratory distress and possible reintubation if her condition deteriorates.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has VAP, for which she is receiving antibiotics. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent antibiotic"

   27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis, respiratory failure, and
   VAP.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   - improved and seems to be tolerating SBT
   - check VBG, since we cannot assess her mental status well given
   underlying disease.  If OK --> trial of extubation (she was previously
   a Grade I view direct laryngoscopy)
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   - complete course of ABX (d/c after eight-day course)
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Concentric Sclerosis
   - no further rx at present
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   - secondary to concentric sclerosis
   - treat with Haldol peri-extubation if needed.  Could consider
   Precedex.
 NEUTROPENIA
   - secondary to cytoxan
   - discuss the role of GCSF with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and oncology

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/51 to 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 50%. Her weight has increased from 130.2 kg at admission to 178.2 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,307 mL of total fluids and an output of 5,160 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,853 mL. Her urine output is within normal limits.

Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.5 K/uL and neutrophil percentage of 90.6%, which may suggest an infection. The platelet count is also elevated at 356 K/uL. Her blood glucose levels are within normal limits. Other lab values, including electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and coagulation profile, are within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging shows an essentially stable chest X-ray with the endotracheal tube placed 4-5 cm above the carina.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Likely multifactorial in setting of obesity, VAP, and pulmonary edema.
   Hypoxia likely worsened by positioning, will try to keep head elevated
   would transition to chair when more stable
   Remains significantly fluid overloaded, will continue diuresis with
   goal 1-2 liters negative today.
   In long term if remains hypoxic may need trach
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   Only MSSA isolated from sputum to date, though seemed to decompensate
   with fevers when coverage narrowed to nafcillin. Would complete 8 day
   course of zosyn/cipro/vancomycin, currently day [**4-8**], for presumed VAP,
   in absence of further data for nonfermenting GNRs. Reculture if
   febrile.
 Agitation
   Recovery may be prolongued per neurology. Will start standing ativan
   with prn ativan/zyprexa. Neurology recommendations appreciated
   regarding long-term behaviorial management.
 Neutropenia
   Likely secondary to chemotherapy, follow ANC, neuropenic precautions.
   Neupogen per neurology recommendatiosn.
   Would start atovaquone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1091**], atovaquone if can pass NG
   tube otherwise may need inhaled pentamidine.
 Anemia
   [**Month (only) 60**] also be chemotherapy related, no evidence of DIC or hemolysis on
   recent labs. Transfuse Hb<7.
 Concentric Sclerosis
   S/p pheresis and cyclophosphamide, on steroid taper. Management per
   neurology.
 Urinary tract infection
   Recent E. coli UTI, would treat for 14 day course of cipro ending [**1-28**].
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Not currently being fed. Place Dobhoff tube today. For long
   term, may need gastrostomy tube
 due to habitus may need placement in
   OR, in setting of neutropenia not an option at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of concentric sclerosis who has undergone cytoxan and plasmapheresis. She is currently in the ICU and has been extubated. The patient has been started on G-CSF, diuresed, and is febrile with ongoing cultures and unchanged antibiotics. She has allergies to prednisone, sulfa, and phenytoin. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam on 01/20/20 at 04:00 AM, followed by ciprofloxacin on 01/20/20 at 10:00 PM, vancomycin on 01/21/20 at 08:36 PM, and piperacillin on 01/22/20 at 04:02 AM. She is receiving various infusions including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Infection: The patient is febrile and has ongoing cultures, indicating a possible infection. The presence of bacteria in the urine, blood, and sputum samples further supports the risk of infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered based on the culture results.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]) - Likely multifactorial in
   setting of obesity, VAP, and pulmonary edema.
   -- RSBI this AM 35; wean off propofol, switch to SBT and if well
   tolerated would extubate
   -- prior to extubation would check a venous blood gas as difficult to
   assess underlying mental status
   -- would also continue to diurese goal -1
 2 liters (continues to
   autodiurese very well)
   -- treat pulmonary infection as below
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   -- MSSA isolated from sputum, but now on expanded coverage after fever
   and hypoxia with just naficillin/cipro.
   -- Continue zosyn/cipro/vancomycin for 8 day course,  today is day #4,
   can maintain cipro for UTI as below
   -- follow up cultures and reculture if febrile
 Neutropenia
   -          chemotherapy related (cyclophosphamide)
   -          check ANC, trend daily
   -          maintain precautions
   -          f/u Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s recs re: neupogen
 Anemia
   -          stable, may be [**1-2**] chemo. Would only transfuse Hb>7.
   -          DIC and hemolysis ruled out
 Constipation
   -          Patient without recent bowel movement, is on fentanyl
   -          KUB without evidence of bowel obstruction but ++ stool
   -          Uptitrate bowel regimen prn today
 Concentric Sclerosis
   -          s/p all pheresis and cyclophosphamide sesisons
   -          Tapering steroids per neurology
   -          Follow up Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommendations
   -          If continues to be persistantly altered or agitated after
   extubation, would use haldol prn
   -          Check daily EKGs to monitor QTc on haldol
   -          Consider precedex as alternative for sedation
 Urinary tract infection
   -          Urine culture with pan-sensitive E. coli, will be covered on
   current VAP regimen. Complete 14d course of treatment as patient has
   foley (day 1 of cipro = [**1-14**], continue until [**1-28**])

","The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of concentric sclerosis who has undergone cytoxan and plasmapheresis. She was extubated but experienced a myoclonic seizure post-extubation, which responded to ativan. She has been started on precedex for sedation and G-CSF. The patient is febrile, and antibiotics have not been changed. She has allergies to prednisone psychosis, sulfa rash, and phenytoin sodium psychosis. Her last dose of antibiotics was zosyn 4.5g IV q8, vancomycin 1g IV q12, and ciprofloxacin 500mg PO q12. Other medications include Neupogen, methylprednisolone taper, ativan, precedex, and heparin SQ.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient is unable to answer pain questions. Flowsheet data as of [**2145-1-22**] 07:09 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/75 to 152/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's weight is 178.2 kg (admission weight: 130.2 kg), and her height is 67 inches. Her cardiac output and cardiac index are within normal ranges. Mixed venous oxygen saturation is stable at 65%. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1943 mL and output of 2910 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 967 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a ventilator in standby mode with a peak inspiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Arterial blood gas analysis shows pH of 7.29.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is an overweight/obese female lying at the end of the bed with feet on a railing. Her eyes/conjunctiva appear normal, and her cardiovascular examination shows no murmurs. Respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present. Extremities show trace edema in both the right and left legs. Neurologic examination notes that the patient is sedated, responds to noxious stimuli, and has not been assessed for movement, tone, or cranial nerves.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 327 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 56 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 15 mg/dL, sodium (Na"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with concentric sclerosis who has been treated with plasmapheresis and cytoxan. She is currently experiencing marked hypoxemia related to atelectasis, resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and volume overload. The patient's behavioral management is challenging, and she exhibits signs of delirium or confusion, which may persist for months.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, and the treatment plan includes continuing the current antibiotics for an eight-day course until she becomes non-neutropenic.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has volume overload, and diuresis is recommended to manage this condition.

3. Concentric sclerosis: The patient has been treated with cytoxan and plasmapheresis for concentric sclerosis. She is currently on steroids, and the plan is to change to intravenous administration.

4. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunosuppressed due to her condition and treatment. Prophylactic measures, such as PCP prophylaxis and neutropenic precautions, are in place to prevent infections.

5. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which is related to an underlying neurologic process. Benzodiazepines and Haldol may"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 27-year-old female with concentric sclerosis and resultant altered mental status (AMS), who was intubated for sedation and venous access for chemotherapy. She has undergone all chemo treatments and plasmapheresis, and her hospital course is complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient continues to be mildly hypoxic after extubation, with multifactorial contributions from obesity, VAP, pulmonary edema, and probable right upper lobe mucus plugging seen on previous bronchoscopy. Hypoxia seems worsened by positioning, and efforts will be made to transition the patient to a chair today to mobilize pulmonary edema and improve any atelectasis. Supplemental O2 will be provided as needed.

The patient is currently on a diuresis regimen with a goal of 1-2 liters negative, which will continue until creatinine levels stabilize. She is also receiving a combination of medications including lorazepam, zyprexa, atovaquone, neupogen, and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient has neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy, and neuropenic precautions will be maintained. She will continue to receive neupogen per neurology recommendations. After confirmation of NGT placement, she will start atovaquone for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).

Additionally, the patient has anemia, which may be chemotherapy-related, and will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of obesity, who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by delirium, neutropenia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently receiving various medications including lorazepam, zyprexa, haloperidol, protonix, lasix, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6째C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 101/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals a Dobbhoff tube at the gastroesophageal junction and a small focal opacity in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, which may indicate developing infection. The patient is receiving proper ICU care, including nutrition support and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's disposition remains in the ICU with a full code status."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])  -
   -          Likely multifactorial contributions from obesity, VAP,
   pulmonary edema, and probable RUL mucus plugging as seen previously
   during bronchoscopy, may now be recurring as seen on CXR.
   -          Hypoxia seems worsened by positioning, will try to keep head
   elevated would transition to chair when more stable
   -          Remains significantly fluid overloaded despite diuresis,
   will continue diuresis with goal 1-2 liters negative today, would
   continue to diurese until creatinine bumps
   -          Supplemental O2 as needed
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   -          Only MSSA isolated from sputum to date, though seemed to
   decompensate with fevers when coverage narrowed to nafcillin
   -          completing 8 day course of zosyn/cipro/vancomycin, currently
   day [**5-9**], for presumed VAP, in absence of further data for nonfermenting
   GNRs. Reculture if febrile.
   -          Canco uptitrated to TID given subtherapeutic trough, would
   recheck in AM
 Agitation
   -          Recovery may be prolonged per neurology
   -          Continue standing ativan and zyprexa.
   -          Precedex
 Neutropenia
   -          secondary to chemotherapy
   -          follow ANC, maintain neuropenic precautions
   -          continue neupogen per neurology recommendations.
   -          After NGT placement confirmed, start atovaquone for PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 1091**]
 Anemia
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] also be chemotherapy related, no evidence of DIC or
   hemolysis on recent labs. Transfuse Hb<7.
 Concentric Sclerosis
   -          S/p pheresis and cyclophosphamide, on steroid taper
   -          f/u neuro recs
 Urinary tract infection
   -          Recent E. coli UTI in setting fo foley cath, would treat for
   14 day course of cipro ending [**1-28**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis who presented with worsening symptoms and was admitted to the ICU. She received chemotherapy and plasmapheresis while intubated but remains agitated and has difficulty with Dobhoff placement. The patient has a medical history of allergies to prednisone, sulfa, and phenytoin sodium. She has received various antibiotics including Piperacillin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin, and Vancomycin. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/65 mmHg to 120/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's weight has increased from 130.2 kg at admission to 178.2 kg currently. She has received several infusions and medications such as Dexmedetomidine, Haloperidol, Furosemide, Heparin Sodium, Pantoprazole, and Lorazepam. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for agitation post-extubation. She remains sedated and has not been assessed for movement. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals a hazy left diaphragm. The patient's assessment includes urinary tract infection,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with a diagnosis of concentric sclerosis admitted for cyclophosphamide treatment. She has been experiencing several medical complications and conditions.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to obesity, fluid overload, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and mucous plugging. Her condition is improving with decreased oxygen requirement.

2. Acute Renal Failure: This is likely caused by aggressive diuresis the previous day. The patient should undergo a fluid challenge and reassessment of heart rate, creatinine levels, and urine output.

3. Concentric Sclerosis: The patient has been treated with pheresis and cyclophosphamide. She should continue with steroid taper and appreciate recommendations from Dr. [Last Name (Title)].

4. Neutropenia: Secondary to cyclophosphamide, the patient's neutropenia has resolved. She should continue receiving Neupogen for 48 hours after her absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is above 1000. Atovaquone should be discontinued.

5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium/confusion is secondary to extensive CNS disease and prolonged sedation. She should continue with standing lorazepam and zyprexa.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch, 178.2 kg individual with a medical history of psychosis, allergy to prednisone, sulfa, and phenytoin. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing agitation, pain, and delirium. They have been on various medications including lorazepam, zyprexa, steroids, pantoprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C, heart rate of 132 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/64 mmHg to 163/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's imaging shows pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, and severe mediastinal vascular engorgement, consistent with volume overload. The patient's assessment and plan include urinary tract infection, neutropenia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), ventilator-acquired pneumonia, concentric sclerosis, delirium, and ICU care.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Concentric Sclerosis: The patient has been diagnosed with concentric sclerosis, but no further details are provided in the note about this condition. It is important to monitor the patient's neurological symptoms and consider appropriate treatment options.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin for a UTI. Regular monitoring of urine output and urinalysis should be done to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and prevent any complications related to the urinary tract.

3. Neutropenia: The patient was previously neutropenic but is no longer at risk. However, it is important to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and overall immune function to ensure they are not susceptible to infections.

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient was on mechanical ventilation but has been successfully extubated and is doing well. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to prevent any further respiratory complications.

5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics for VAP, including vancomycin, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. Close monitoring of the patient's clinical signs, chest X-ray, and sputum cultures should be done to assess the response to treatment and prevent antibiotic resistance.

   treatment, transferred to MICU [**1-2**] to agitation
 Concentric scerlosis:
   -          s/p pheresis and cyclophosphomide
   -          continue steroid taper, currently at 60mg daily of
   methylprednisone
   -          patient followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of neurology, appreciate recs
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   -          Pt had grown E. Coli from urine.  Started on ciprofloxacin,
   with planned 14 day course given foley catheter. (day 14= [**1-28**])
   -          Last UA essentially cleared of infection, pt does not
   complain of urinary sx
   -          New foley in place, needed to monitor I/Os in setting of ARF
 NEUTROPENIA
   -          secondary to chemotherapy, now resolved
   -          as patient no longer neutrapenic, neupogen d/c
d today
   -          leukocytosis likely [**1-2**] to neupogen + steroids
 DELERIUM/CONFUSION
   -          secondary to extensive CNS disease and prolonged sedation.
   -          Marked improvement today, no longer requiring restraints
   -          Will switch zyprexa / Ativan to PRNs
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   -          Pt now extudated, w/ respiratory failure in the setting of
   obesity, fluid overload, and mucous plugging.
   -          s/p diuresis
   -          Pt developed VAP, cultures growing MSSA, but pt became
   febrile whe abx changed from vanc to nafcillin.
   -          Pt completed course of vanc, and on day [**7-9**] of zosyn
   -          No current O2 requirement
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   -          believed to be secondary to over diursis, but Cr continued
   to rise despite fluid challenge
   -          patient still making adequate urine
   -          will check urine lytes and eos, may have ATN or AIN in
   setting of nephrotoxic meds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old female with concentric sclerosis admitted for cyclophosphamide treatment. She was transferred to the MICU due to agitation. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need attention:

1. Concentric sclerosis: The patient has been treated with pheresis and cyclophosphamide. She is currently on a steroid taper of 60mg daily of methylprednisone. The patient is being followed by a neurologist.

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had grown E. coli from urine and was started on ciprofloxacin with a planned 14-day course. Her last urine analysis (UA) essentially cleared the infection, and she does not complain of urinary symptoms. A new Foley catheter has been placed to monitor intake/output (I/Os) in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF).

3. Neutropenia: The patient experienced neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy but has since resolved. Neupogen was discontinued as the patient is no longer neutropenic. Leukocytosis may be related to neupogen and steroids.

4. Delirium/confusion: The patient had delirium/confusion secondary to extensive CNS disease and prolonged sedation. However, there has been marked improvement, and she is no longer requiring restraints. The switch from zyprexa/Ativan to PRNs has been made.

5. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP): The patient was extubated but developed respiratory failure due to obesity, fluid overload, and mucous plugging. She received diuresis and developed VAP, with cultures growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient completed a course of vancomycin and was on day 7-9 of piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She no longer requires supplemental oxygen.

6. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's acute renal failure is believed to be secondary to overdiuresis, as her creatinine (Cr) continued to rise despite fluid challenge. However, the patient is still making adequate urine. It is planned to check urine electrolytes (lytes) and eosinophils (eos), as there may be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in the setting of nephrotoxic medications. Foley catheter will be monitored, and trends in Cr will be followed.

In terms of ICU care, the patient passed a swallow study and is allowed nectar pre-thickened and pureed liquids. Regular insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control. A pheresis catheter has been placed, and a plan for a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) has been made by interventional radiology (IR) on January 25th. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been initiated. The need for restraints will be reviewed. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of concentric sclerosis who has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. She has been treated with cyclophosphamide and is showing signs of improvement in her agitation and delirium. However, her creatinine levels are increasing, suggesting a possible acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's delirium has significantly improved, and she is now on PRN zyprexa and ativan. There are concerns about potential complications such as urinary tract infection (UTI) due to prolonged Foley catheter use, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient's neutropenia has resolved, and she is no longer on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Her respiratory failure has also resolved. The patient is currently receiving nutritional support and has stable oxygen saturation on non-invasive ventilation. She is being monitored for any signs of DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to reassess the patient in the ICU and consider transferring her to a floor bed later in the day if her agitation remains under control."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The note mentions that the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with Ciprofloxacin. The Foley catheter will be removed when the patient's mental status improves. Neutropenia has resolved, and the patient is no longer receiving G-CSF. The patient also had respiratory failure, which has resolved, and pneumonia acquired from mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP), for which treatment with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam is being completed.

The patient is being treated for concentric sclerosis with steroids as recommended by Dr. [Name]. Delirium and confusion have shown significant improvement, and the patient's zyprexa and ativan doses are being changed to as-needed basis. Acute kidney injury (ARF) is not responsive to fluid challenge, and there are concerns about potential nephrotoxicity caused by Cytoxan or Zosyn, which may result in acute tubular necrosis (AIN) or acute tubular injury (ATN). Therefore, Zosyn has been discontinued, and close monitoring of creatinine and urine output is advised.

Regarding ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines (such as the pheresis catheter) are being managed. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress"
