","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old with a chief complaint of hemoptysis in the setting of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Upon admission, the patient had a slight drop in O2 saturation after being administered maintenance fluids, so the fluids were stopped. The patient's history could not be obtained as they were unable to provide it due to language barriers. No known drug allergies were reported. The patient has been receiving various ICU medications and infusions. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms including cough. Vital signs and flow sheet data are provided, showing stable temperatures, slightly elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and slightly reduced oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also noted. Physical examination findings include general appearance of being thin, pale conjunctiva, cervical adenopathy, distant heart sounds, diminished air movement in the right lung field, crackles, and clubbing of the extremities. Neurologic examination was not performed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal coagulation studies. The patient's blood glucose, electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and other lab values are within normal range. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of hemoptysis and lung cancer, ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to lung cancer and associated symptoms such as hemoptysis, pneumonia, or atelectasis. The patient's low blood pressure and altered mental status may indicate potential cardiovascular or neurologic complications. The abnormal coagulation studies may increase the risk of bleeding or clotting disorders. The elevated white blood cell count could suggest an infection. Regular monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   71 year old woman with non-small cell lung CA who comes with complaints
   of hemoptysis and ongoing cough. Echocardiogram during rounds showed
   tamponade. Pericardiocentesis to be scheduled this AM.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION
   Pericardiocentesis later today. Consider bronchoscopy, other care after
   that.
   HEMOPTYSIS
   CT scan from outside hospital is a somewhat bleak picture and offers
   little hope that simple interventions will yield major gains for
   hemoptysis and cough.
   - bronchoscopy possible after pericardiocentesis
   - transfuse for significant (>2) drops in Hct or goal of 25
   LUNG CA
   Based on oncology consult note from outside hospital, and CT scan
   viewed from OSH, it is highly unlikely that further chemotherapy,
   radiation, etc, will have any significant impact on pt
s lung CA.
   HYPERTENSION
   Pt has past diagnosis of hypertension. Holding diltiazem as pt needs
   rapid heart rate for hemodynamic support.
   GOALS OF CARE
   Had lengthy family meeting after rounds today. Informed pt
s children
   of very small chances on ventilator or with resuscitation. Lengthy
   conversation of goals of care. Family clear that they want
   pericardiocentesis but in the somewhat longer run want DNR/DNI. This
   can be revisited after pericardiocentesis for which she should be full
   code, and in which benefits substantially outweigh risks.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for procedure; regular diet after that

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with advanced non-small cell lung cancer presenting with hemoptysis and ongoing cough. She has a past diagnosis of hypertension and her current vital signs include a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/61 to 150/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, cervical adenopathy, distant heart sounds, crackles and diminished breath sounds in the right lung field, clubbing of the extremities, and warm skin. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated liver enzymes. An echocardiogram showed tamponade, and pericardiocentesis is planned. The patient's family is aware of the poor prognosis and has chosen to pursue pericardiocentesis with a DNR/DNI status in the longer term.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's diminished breath sounds in the right lung field may indicate a compromised respiratory function, which could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The echocardiogram findings suggest cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.
3. Bleeding: The patient's hemoptysis and"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old with NSCLC
 Effusion - ?tamponade. TTE this morning. IVF for hemodynamic support.
   ##Hemoptysis - will review outside contrast CT with radiology,
   particulary with eye toward ? PE. If inadequate will need our own CTA.
   ##Goals of Care - Clearly very poor prognosis. Will need to speak with
   family and patienrt today about code status and goals. She remains at
   risk
   for hemodynamic collapse and there seems little utility in ACLS. Will
   hol dfmaily meeting today.
   ##?PNA - Appear to be air bronchograms on CXR. Check sputum, empiric
   coverage with levofloxacin for now.

","The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer), who presented with hemoptysis and pericardial effusion. She has undergone multiple courses of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The patient has a sub-massive hemoptysis and is currently in the ICU for further management.

On review of systems, the patient complains of fatigue, tachycardia, and cough. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/61 mmHg to 150/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH level of 7.31.

Physical examination reveals distant S2 heart sound, elevated JVP (jugular venous pressure), and bronchial breath sounds on the right side. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessable due to absent right and left radial pulses, as well as absent right and left digital pulses. The patient's neurological examination is incomplete.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 317 K/uL, platelet count of 125 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose level of 125 mg/dL, and sodium/potassium levels within normal range. Other lab"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of lung cancer, pericardial effusion, and hemoptysis. She was transferred from another hospital and has been experiencing sub-massive hemoptysis for the past month. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, and her blood pressure is within the normal range. She is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals distant S2 heart sound, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and absent right and left radial pulses. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. There are also abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low sodium, chloride, and potassium, as well as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's condition is critical, and she has a poor prognosis. The medical team plans to perform pericardiocentesis and discuss code status and goals of care with the patient and her family. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's elevated JVP, distant S2 heart sound, and hemodynamic instability suggest the possibility of cardiac tamponade due to the pericardial effusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and decreased oxygen saturation indicate potential respiratory failure. She may require mechanical ventilation to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer who presented with complaints of hemoptysis, ongoing cough, and was discovered to be in pericardial tamponade. The patient underwent a pericardial drain placement but experienced complications during the procedure, including cannulization of the right ventricle and subsequent hemodynamic compromise due to atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's current condition includes ongoing respiratory compromise, hypertension, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently on amiodarone drip for tachycardia and will be converted to oral amiodarone today. She is also receiving Lasix for fluid overload post-pericardial drain procedure.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 31.5% to 40.5%, and a platelet count (Plt) of 39. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus levels. 

The assessment and plan include the following:

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of heart disease, heart failure (diastolic), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, pericardial effusion (without tamponade), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hemoptysis, and lung cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU due to pericardial tamponade and hemoptysis. The patient underwent a pericardial drain procedure, during which he experienced SVT and was on amio drip. The patient also had a right ventricular (RV) drain placed instead of in the pericardium, which was later removed and closed with angioseal. The patient is now being converted to oral amiodarone. The patient's blood pressure has been in the 130s, but no treatment was initiated for hypertension. The patient's potassium levels were repleted. Radiology reviewed an OSH CT showing no pulmonary embolism (PE), mass compressing the right bronchus intermedius, moderate pericardial effusion, tumor invading the right chest wall, no pericardial fat between the pericardium and tumor, and ground glass appearance at the L base. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 36.7°C, heart rate (HR) of 120 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 105-142 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% on 5 L nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 59 mmHg, PO2 of 121 mmHg, HCO3- of 37 mEq/L, and base excess of -5 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress, normal pulses in all extremities, crackles at the bases, rhonchorous breath sounds throughout the right chest more than the left, and absent pulses in the right extremity. The patient's neurologic examination showed that he was attentive, followed simple commands, responded to verbal stimuli, but movement, tone, and strength assessments were not performed. The patient's lab results showed elevated potassium levels (339 K/uL), low magnesium levels (0.5 mg/dL), and slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.5 K/uL. The patient's Hct level decreased from 42.4% to 40.5%, and his platelet count (Plt) decreased from 39 to 3208. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level remained stable at 0.5 mg/dL, and his glucose level was within normal range. The patient's PT/PTT/INR were elevated, with PT/PTT at 16.7/23."

   PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE
   Evidence of RV collapse on ECHO. S/p pericardial drain placement
   complicated by cannulization of right ventricule. Patient is s/p
   angioseal of right ventricule. During procedure patient went into
   SVT/Afib and was placed on an amiodarone drip. Given subsequent HD
   compromise with afib, patient will be maintained on amiodarone
   - amiodarone 600mg PO load today, then turn off drip. Tomorrow [**1-9**]
   start amio 300 mg daily.
   - holding home diltiazem b/c sbps in 130s and patient stable
   HEMOPTYSIS
   CT scan from outside hospital is a somewhat bleak picture and offers
   little hope that simple interventions will yield major gains for
   hemoptysis and cough.
   - consider delaying bronchoscopy to outpatient given patient with scant
   hemoptysis while in hospital, given recent procedure
   - transfuse HCT <25
   LUNG CA
   Based on oncology consult note from outside hospital, and CT scan
   viewed from OSH, it is highly unlikely that further chemotherapy,
   radiation, etc, will have any significant impact on pt
s lung CA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer who presented with hemoptysis, ongoing cough, and was discovered to be in pericardial tamponade.
- The patient underwent pericardial drain placement, which was complicated by cannulization of the right ventricle. She was also given an angioseal of the right ventricle.
- During the procedure, the patient went into supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation and was placed on an amiodarone drip.
- The patient's subsequent hemodynamic compromise with atrial fibrillation led to the decision to maintain her on amiodarone.
- It is planned to give the patient a 600mg PO load of amiodarone today and then turn off the drip. Starting tomorrow, she will be on a daily dose of 300mg of amiodarone.
- The patient's blood pressure remains stable in the 130s, and home diltiazem is being held.
- The patient continues to have crackles at the bases bilaterally, indicating ongoing fluid overload.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows a mass compressing the right bronchus intermedius, moderate pericardial effusion, tumor invading the right chest wall, and no pericardial fat between the pericardium and tumor. There is also ground glass at the L base.

   71 year old woman with hemoptysis, advanced NSCLC c/b pericardial
   invasion, impingement on mainstem bronchus, now pericardial tamponade
   now s/p pericardiocentesis c/b RV puncture. I agree with a/p as noted
   in resident note. Briefly, she is hemodynamicaly intact post drainage.
   Some afib which has responded to amiodorone and increased O2
   requirement responsive to lasix. Had planed on IP procedure today for
   possible palliation of endobronchial sources of hemoptysis and possible
   to airway stent. Appears stable now, but will discuss with family and
   IP re: possibility of additional procedure. Stat echo this morning to
   assess effusion. She has a very grim short term prognosis and family's
   goal remains to get her home. Palliative care to see today. Se is
   DNR/DNI and would hope for discharge home with hospice in the next
   24-48 hours. Remains on levaquin for possible PNA in LLL.

   ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident and fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree
   with their notes above, including assessment and plan
   Key Points:
          Hemoptysis improved today
          Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3217**] met with family to discuss hospice, palliative care
   options
          Afib with RVR, now on amiodarone and in sinus tach with
   narrow complex
          Pericardial pigtail drained 90cc overnight, no e/o tamponade
   on echo (prelimary read)
          I met with pt
s daughters [**Name (NI) 3179**] and [**Name2 (NI) 8**], in presence of Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 901**] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3012**], to discuss the risks and benefits of the rigid
   bronchoscopy with APC and bronchial artery embolization. I am concerned
   that if the primary goal is for Ms [**Known lastname 3180**] to go home, then the potential
   benefit of reducing hemoptysis, which has already improved, may be
   outweighed by the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia or massive
   hemoptysis, which would obviously preclude her from going home with her
   family. I discussed the procedure and potential complications and
   answered their questions. For now I think we will hold off on the rigid
   bronch and will discuss possibility of embolization with IR
          Blood cx with 2 bottles growing GPC
   Overall I am very concerned that the longer Ms [**Known lastname 3180**] stays here the less
   likely it is that she will be able to go home. She still has a pigtail
   in her pericardial space at this time, but basically is stable though
   with tachycardia and hypoxemia, 92-94% on 4L. I will be in further
   discussion with the family regarding goals of care and options.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old woman with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
- She presented with hemoptysis and dyspnea, and was found to have pericardial effusion causing tamponade.
- The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in a right ventricular (RV) puncture.
- She experienced complications from the procedure, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is currently being managed with amiodarone.
- The patient required increasing doses of Lasix for oxygenation.
- Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia.
- The patient has a history of NSCLC with pericardial invasion and impingement on the mainstem bronchus.
- She has a grim short-term prognosis, and her family's goal is to get her home.
- The patient has been started on palliative care and is DNR/DNI.
- Possible procedures such as rigid bronchoscopy with APC and bronchial artery embolization have been discussed, but the attending physician is concerned about the risks and potential complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old woman with hemoptysis, advanced NSCLC c/b pericardial
   invasion, impingement on mainstem bronchus, now pericardial tamponade
   now s/p pericardiocentesis c/b RV puncture. I agree with a/p as noted
   in resident note. Briefly, she is hemodynamicaly intact post drainage.
   Some afib which has responded to amiodorone and increased O2
   requirement responsive to lasix. Had planed on IP procedure today for
   possible palliation of endobronchial sources of hemoptysis and possible
   to airway stent. Appears stable now, but will discuss with family and
   IP re: possibility of additional procedure. Stat echo this morning to
   assess effusion. She has a very grim short term prognosis and family's
   goal remains to get her home. Palliative care to see today. Se is
   DNR/DNI and would hope for discharge home with hospice in the next
   24-48 hours. Remains on levaquin for possible PNA in LLL.
   Key Points:
          Hemoptysis improved today
          Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3217**] met with family to discuss hospice, palliative care
   options
          Afib with RVR, now on amiodarone and in sinus tach with
   narrow complex
          Pericardial pigtail drained 90cc overnight, no e/o tamponade
   on echo (prelimary read)
          I met with pt
s daughters [**Name (NI) 3179**] and [**Name2 (NI) 8**], in presence of Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 901**] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3012**], to discuss the risks and benefits of the rigid
   bronchoscopy with APC and bronchial artery embolization. I am concerned
   that if the primary goal is for Ms [**Known lastname 3180**] to go home, then the potential
   benefit of reducing hemoptysis, which has already improved, may be
   outweighed by the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia or massive
   hemoptysis, which would obviously preclude her from going home with her
   family. I discussed the procedure and potential complications and
   answered their questions. For now I think we will hold off on the rigid
   bronch and will discuss possibility of embolization with IR
          Blood cx with 2 bottles growing GPC
   Overall I am very concerned that the longer Ms [**Known lastname 3180**] stays here the less
   likely it is that she will be able to go home. She still has a pigtail
   in her pericardial space at this time, but basically is stable though
   with tachycardia and hypoxemia, 92-94% on 4L. I will be in further
   discussion with the family regarding goals of care and options.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), presenting with symptoms of dyspnea and hemoptysis. She has a pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade, which has been relieved through pericardiocentesis. The patient also experienced a right ventricular puncture during the procedure. 

Overnight, the patient's blood culture showed growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Her vital signs indicate tachycardia, with a heart rate of 125 beats per minute, and slightly elevated blood pressure. Respiratory rate is within normal range, but oxygen saturation is at 92% on nasal cannula. 

The patient has received various treatments including furosemide, morphine sulfate, and antibiotics. Her laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. 

The patient's overall condition is stable, but she has been experiencing some atrial fibrillation, which has responded to amiodarone. She requires increased oxygen due to hypoxemia, which has improved with the administration of lasix. 

The plan is to proceed with an interventional procedure (IP) to palliate endobronchial sources of hemoptysis and potentially place an airway stent. However, the possibility of additional procedures will be discussed with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pericardial tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis and responded well to the procedure. Her hemoptysis has improved, but she remains in critical condition. The family's goal is to take her home with hospice, and the patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's advanced NSCLC may have led to pericardial invasion and subsequent pericardial tamponade. This condition can cause cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
2. Massive hemoptysis: The patient's history of hemoptysis suggests that there could be ongoing bleeding from the lungs. If this bleeding becomes severe, it can lead to massive hemoptysis, which can compromise her ability to breathe and potentially result in cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The presence of GPC (Gram-positive cocci) in two bottles of blood culture indicates a potential bloodstream infection. This can be a serious complication that may require prompt antibiotic treatment.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia (low oxygen saturation) despite being on supplemental oxygen indicates compromised respiratory function. Prolonged hypoxemia can lead to respiratory failure, which may necessitate mechanical ventilation and intensive care support.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presenting with hemoptysis and pericardial effusion causing tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis but experienced right ventricular puncture and atrial fibrillation as complications. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed a compression of the right atrium due to a thrombus and a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion. The patient also has a history of bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis. She is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, amiodarone, furosemide, morphine sulfate, and others. Her vital signs indicate tachycardia and mild hypoxemia. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's prognosis is described as grim. Potential medical complications that can arise include pericardial effusion, hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, bacteremia, hypernatremia, overdiuresis, and poor oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion: The patient already has a pericardial effusion, which is causing tamponade. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the effusion.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing mild hypoxemia, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation post-pericardiocentesis. There is a risk of continued arrhythmias or progression to chronic atrial fibrillation.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of GPC bacteremia, and there is a risk of ongoing infection.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, indicating an imbalance of sodium levels in the body. This can lead to dehydration and other complications.
6. Overdiuresis: The patient has received significant amounts of diuretics, which can result in excessive fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Poor oral intake: The patient's poor oral intake may increase the risk of malnutrition and other complications related to inadequate nutrition.

Please note that the potential medical complications mentioned above are based on the information provided in the progress note."

She underwent pericardiocentesis, which resulted in a right ventricular puncture and peri-procedure atrial fibrillation. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) post procedure showed compression of the right atrium, suspected clot, and a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion. 

The patient subsequently received bronchial artery embolization for ongoing hemoptysis and started on vancomycin due to group B streptococcus bacteremia from blood cultures. She also received an amiodarone bolus for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and will continue with oral administration. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/80 mmHg to 134/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. 

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 14.1 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 332 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and hypernatremia. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient has a grim prognosis due to advanced NSCLC causing pericardial invasion and impingement on the mainstem bronchus. The plan includes pericardial effusion management, ongoing bronchial artery embolization, support for hypoxemia, antibiotic treatment for possible pneumonia, and consideration for hospice care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory distress, infection, cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, and complications related to the advanced stage of lung cancer."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presenting with hemoptysis and pericardial effusion causing tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in right ventricular puncture and peri-procedure atrial fibrillation. The patient has been stable post-procedure but remains tachycardic. She also had right bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis and has been started on vancomycin due to suspected gram-positive bacteremia. The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypernatremia. Her prognosis is described as grim. The plan includes follow-up trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) after drain removal, continuing supplemental oxygen for a goal saturation of >92%, and completing amiodarone loading dose with planned oral administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion and tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion has led to tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition requiring prompt intervention. Close monitoring of cardiac function and timely management of any recurrence of pericardial effusion are crucial.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response during the peri-procedure period. Ongoing monitoring and management of this arrhythmia are necessary to maintain hemodynamic"

   71 year old woman with hemoptysis, advanced NSCLC c/b pericardial
   invasion, impingement on mainstem bronchus, now pericardial tamponade
   now s/p pericardiocentesis c/b RV puncture. I agree with a/p as noted
   in resident note. Briefly, she is hemodynamicaly intact post drainage.
   Some afib which has responded to amiodorone and increased O2
   requirement responsive to lasix. Had planed on IP procedure today for
   possible palliation of endobronchial sources of hemoptysis and possible
   to airway stent. Appears stable now, but will discuss with family and
   IP re: possibility of additional procedure. Stat echo this morning to
   assess effusion. She has a very grim short term prognosis and family's
   goal remains to get her home. Palliative care to see today. Se is
   DNR/DNI and would hope for discharge home with hospice in the next
   24-48 hours. Remains on levaquin for possible PNA in LLL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of hemoptysis, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) potentially causing pericardial invasion and impingement on the mainstem bronchus. She was diagnosed with pericardial tamponade and underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in a right ventricular puncture. The patient's current condition is stable post-drainage, with some atrial fibrillation responding to amiodarone and increased oxygen requirement responsive to furosemide (Lasix). A planned interventional procedure for possible palliation of endobronchial sources of hemoptysis and airway stenting has been discussed. The patient's short-term prognosis is grim, and the family's goal is to get her home. Palliative care will be seen today, and she is DNR/DNI. The patient may be discharged home with hospice in the next 24-48 hours, continuing levaquin for possible pneumonia in the left lower lobe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia in the left lower lobe: The patient is currently on levaquin for this condition, indicating a possible bacterial infection.
2. Right ventricular puncture: The pericardiocentesis procedure resulted in a right ventricular puncture, which can lead to complications such as bleeding or cardiac tamponade if not managed properly.
3. Atrial fibrillation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman with a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. She presents with complaints of hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and ongoing cough. The patient has a history of heart disease, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. 

The patient was transferred from another hospital with a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade. Pericardial tamponade is a condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac around the heart, leading to impaired heart function. The patient underwent pericardial drain placement, but the procedure was complicated by cannulization of the right ventricle. She also received angioseal of the right ventricle. During the procedure, the patient experienced supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation (SVT/Afib) and was placed on an amiodarone drip. 

Due to subsequent heart dysfunction caused by AFib, the patient will be maintained on amiodarone. Home diltiazem has been held because the patient's blood pressure remains in the 130s and she is stable. The patient's cardiac recommendations will be followed up.

The patient also has hemoptysis, which is the coughing up of blood. A CT scan from the outside hospital shows a bleak picture and offers little hope that simple interventions"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer who presents with hemoptysis and has developed pericardial effusion. She has a history of heart disease, including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

The patient experienced complications during pericardial drain placement, including cannulization of the right ventricle. She was treated for supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation with amiodarone, and it was decided to maintain her on amiodarone due to hemodynamic compromise associated with atrial fibrillation.

The patient's hemoptysis is ongoing, and a CT scan suggests that simple interventions may not significantly improve her condition. The possibility of rigid bronchoscopic intervention is being discussed with the family and cardiology team.

The patient's lung cancer is not expected to respond well to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and palliative care has been consulted.

The patient also has hypertension, but it is not considered a concern given her limited life expectancy. Diltiazem is being held.

The patient is currently in sinus tachycardia but was previously in atrial fibrillation during the procedure. It is planned to convert her back to oral amiodarone and stop the drip.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, presenting with pericardial effusion and hemoptysis. The patient underwent embolization of the right bronchial artery due to ongoing hemoptysis. Blood cultures revealed gram-positive cocci, leading to the initiation of vancomycin treatment. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia rhythm, with a heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/80 to 134/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a distended abdomen and clubbing of the left extremities. 

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, normal hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated sodium and potassium levels, decreased albumin level, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and normal calcium and magnesium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Tamponade: The presence of a moderate pericardial effusion increases the risk of cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by impaired filling of the heart chambers.

2. Infection: The positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci indicate a possible infection. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to se"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer who presents with pericardial effusion and hemoptysis. She has a history of heart disease, including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient was discovered to be in pericardial tamponade and underwent pericardial drain placement, which was complicated by cannulization of the right ventricle. She also experienced supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation during the procedure and was placed on amiodarone drip. Due to subsequent hemodynamic compromise with atrial fibrillation, the patient will be maintained on amiodarone - amiodarone 600mg PO load today, then turning off the drip. Starting amio 300 mg daily tomorrow.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 127/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with absent right radial pulse and absent left radial pulse, as well as crackles in the bilateral lung fields. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0-10.9 K/uL, hematocrit of 31.5-41.8%, platelet count of 332-39 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4-0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 125-138 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes heart disease, acute diastolic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, pericardial effusion without tamponade, atrial fibrillation, hemoptysis, and non-small cell lung cancer. The plan includes maintaining the patient on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, holding home diltiazem due to stable blood pressure, and discussing rigid bronchoscopy for hemoptysis with the family and cardiology team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, further episodes of atrial fibrillation, infection related to the pericardial drain, and respiratory complications due to lung cancer."

","The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of non-small cell lung cancer presenting with hemoptysis, ongoing cough, and a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade. She underwent pericardial drain placement complicated by cannulization of the right ventricle and subsequent supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, for which she was placed on amiodarone drip. The patient's hemodynamics have been compromised due to atrial fibrillation, and she will be maintained on amiodarone.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. He has a history of heart disease, including heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient also has a history of lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with a pericardial effusion but no signs of tamponade. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including prophylactic heparin for DVT and stress ulcer prevention with PPI. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 119/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. 

His physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of his lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities, and normal neurologic function. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with decreased hematocrit and creatinine levels. Other lab values, such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and liver function tests, are within normal range. 

The patient's chest X-ray from 1/7/2190 at 11:23 PM shows a large cardiac silhouette with obliteration of the right cardiophrenic angle and mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.

","The patient is a 71-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU with pericardial tamponade and hemoptysis. She underwent pericardial drain placement but experienced complications, including cannulization of the right ventricle and subsequent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was started on amiodarone for rhythm control.

The patient's hemoptysis is being managed with palliative care measures, including rigid bronchoscopy and embolization of the right brachial artery. Further chemotherapy or radiation therapy is deemed unlikely to have a significant impact on her lung cancer.

The patient has hypernatremia and hemodynamic instability, which have improved with fluid administration. Her hypertension is not a concern given her limited life expectancy, and antihypertensive medication is being held.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI), and she is currently in the ICU under palliative care arrangements, including setting up potential hospice with Cantonese-speaking providers."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with hemoptysis and pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in a right ventricular puncture and post-procedure atrial fibrillation. The patient's pericardial drain was removed, and she has shown hemodynamic stability post-drainage. However, her prognosis remains grim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a history of pericardial effusion, which can lead to cardiac tamponade. This condition may recur, requiring further intervention.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient has experienced hemoptysis, which can be a sign of lung cancer progression or other underlying respiratory issues. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent excessive bleeding.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient is at risk of hypoxemia due to her respiratory condition. Oxygen supplementation may be required to maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/RVR): The patient developed AFib w/RVR after the pericardiocentesis procedure. She received an amiodarone bolus and will be started on complete oral loading. Close monitoring and management are essential to control the heart rhythm.
5. GPC Bacteremia: The patient is being treated empirically for possible"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of hemoptysis, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with pericardial invasion and impingement on the mainstem bronchus, resulting in pericardial tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and was found to have right ventricular puncture. She is currently hemodynamically stable post-drainage but remains tachycardic. The patient's prognosis is described as grim.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pericardial effusion - The patient had a pericardial effusion that required pericardiocentesis. There is a risk of recurrence or re-accumulation of fluid around the heart, which may necessitate further intervention.
2. Hemoptysis - Although the patient had no further hemoptysis after right bronchial artery embolization, there is still a possibility of recurrent or worsening coughing up of blood.
3. Hypoxemia - The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen to maintain a goal saturation level of >92%. However, there is a risk of continued low oxygen levels in the blood.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - The patient was given an amiodarone bolus and will continue with a complete load orally. This condition can lead to an irregular heartbeat and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
5. GPC bacteremia -"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with hemoptysis and pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis but experienced a right ventricular puncture and peri-procedure atrial fibrillation. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed compression of the right atrium due to a clot and small-mod pericardial effusion. The following day, another TTE revealed a small pericardial effusion with an organizing clot, and the pericardial drain was removed. The patient is currently receiving ICU care and is being managed for various complications including pericardial effusion, hemoptysis, NSCLC, hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, CNS bacteremia, and feeding intolerance. The plan is to transition her home with hospice care in the near future.

1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially presented with pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade. Although the pericardial effusion has improved, there is still a small-mod effusion present. Continuous monitoring of cardiac function and further intervention if necessary are crucial.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient continues to have minimal blood-tinged sputum despite bronchial artery embolization. Close monitoring for recurrent"

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presents with hemoptysis and pericardial effusion causing tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in a right ventricular puncture and peri-procedure atrial fibrillation. Subsequently, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed compression of the right atrium due to a thrombus and small-mod pericardial effusion. Over the next 24 hours, the patient experienced recurrent atrial fibrillation and her pericardial effusion remained unchanged, with an organizing clot. The pericardial drain was removed, and all other ICU medications were continued. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a slightly elevated heart rate. Her respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, while her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal range. The patient's electrolyte levels are also within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Her liver function tests and kidney function tests are within normal range as well. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a mild respiratory acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with hemoptysis and pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in a right ventricular puncture and peri-procedure atrial fibrillation. The patient has been hemodynamically stable post drainage but remains tachycardic. Her prognosis is described as grim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion - The patient had a pericardial effusion that required drainage. There is a possibility of recurrent effusion and potential need for repeat drainage or surgical intervention.
2. Hemoptysis - The patient experienced hemoptysis, which has been managed with bronchial artery embolization. There is a risk of recurrent or worsening hemoptysis.
3. Hypoxemia - The patient has been receiving supplemental oxygen to maintain a goal saturation level of >92%. There is a risk of continued or worsening hypoxemia.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR) - The patient developed AFib w/RVR, for which she received an amiodarone bolus and will be started on a complete load of oral medication. There is a risk of ongoing arrhythmias or complications associated with AFib.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presenting with hemoptysis and pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. She underwent pericardiocentesis which resulted in a right ventricular puncture and peri-procedure atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but tachycardic.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a history of pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade. There is a risk of recurrence or ongoing fluid accumulation.

2. Hemoptysis: Although the patient has had an episode of hemoptysis, it has been managed with bronchial artery embolization. However, there is still a risk of recurrent or worsening hemoptysis.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood. This may require continuous supplemental oxygen to maintain a goal saturation above 92%.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR): The patient has developed atrial fibrillation after the pericardiocentesis procedure. She has received an amiodarone bolus and will be on a complete loading dose orally. This indicates a need for ongoing monitoring and management of her cardiac rhythm.

5. GPC bacteremia: The patient is"
