   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3954**] is a 68 yo M with hx of COPD on 3L O2, CAD s/p cardiac
   arrest, lung CA s/p RUL resection/chemo/radiation, trachemalacia s/p
   tracheal stent replacement last week, presents from OSH for several
   days SOB. Found to be in hypercapneic respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:   Differential is pneumonia versus COPD.  CXR
   concerning for left upper pneumonia.
   -Started on cefepime in addition to cipro and vancomycin
   -Continue higher dose of prednisone 60 mg daily w/ taper
   -Barrier to extubation is sedation, was increasingly agitated last
   night and restarted on versed+fentanyl; attempt to wean sedation off to
   propofol again.  Can give 1X doses of ativan PRN for sedation.
   -This PM attempt retrying weaning to pressure support.
   #. Hypertension:
   -holding home BP meds given hypotension
   -Would monitor BPs today given on steroids
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis - Over past several days has been hyponatremia and
   hyperkalemic, suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.  Likely b/c of
   chronic steroid use at home for COPD; was on lower dose for last
   several days which could have caused some AI.  Improved electrolytes
   this AM on the higher dose of prednisone suggesting this is improving.
   Some of the metabolic alkalosis is also compensation for chronic
   respiratory acidosis given his COPD.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, cardiac arrest, lung cancer, tracheomalacia, and tracheal stent replacement. He was admitted to the ICU due to several days of shortness of breath and hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to pneumonia versus COPD exacerbation. The CXR shows concerns for left upper lobe pneumonia. The patient has been started on cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin antibiotics. Higher doses of prednisone have been continued with a taper. Sedation has been restarted with versed and fentanyl, and attempts have been made to wean off propofol and pressure support.

2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being held due to hypotension. Blood pressure monitoring will continue today given the use of steroids.

3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has been experiencing hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. This is likely due to chronic steroid use at home for COPD. Improved electrolytes have been observed with higher doses of prednisone. Some metabolic alkalosis may also be compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD. Daily electrolyte follow-up is planned.

4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient will continue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, cardiac arrest, lung cancer, tracheomalacia, and tracheal stent replacement. He presents with respiratory distress and is in hypercapneic respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving multiple medications including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, prednisone, midazolam, fentanyl, and others. His vital signs are stable, but he has low blood pressures and is agitated. The patient has been monitored closely, and his condition has been fluctuating.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD. The CXR shows left upper lobe pneumonia, suggesting a possible infection. The patient has already been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the respiratory distress persists. Further evaluation and management are required to address this issue.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures are consistently low, which may be related to his chronic steroid use for COPD. Holding home BP meds and monitoring BPs closely are recommended to manage this condition.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has been experiencing hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, suggesting adrenal insufficiency. Chronic steroid use for COPD may contribute to this condition. Adjusting the prednisone dose has improved electrolyte levels."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and lung cancer who presented with shortness of breath (SOB) several days ago. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement with the addition of broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin) to treat the pneumonia. The patient also received prednisone for the COPD exacerbation, with a plan for gradual tapering.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/54 mmHg to 117/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits.

- He was intubated and received mechanical ventilation but was extubated successfully and maintained good oxygen saturation levels.
- The patient's blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.44, indicating respiratory alkalosis.
- He has been receiving antibiotics (cefeprime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin) for suspected pneumonia and high-dose prednisone for his COPD.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/59 mmHg to 130/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, chronic lower back pain, gout, anemia, and adrenal insufficiency.
- His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count.
- Imaging and microbiology reports indicate possible pneumonia and no growth in the mini BAL culture.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, lung cancer, and tracheomalacia. He presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was found to be in hypercapnic respiratory failure. He was intubated and received mechanical ventilation. He is now extubated and being weaned off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's differential includes pneumonia versus COPD exacerbation. He has a concern for left upper lobe pneumonia on the chest X-ray. He has been treated with antibiotics (cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin) and high-dose prednisone. He is currently on 3-4 liters of oxygen and may need teaching of CPAP.
2. Hypertension: The patient's home blood pressure medications have been withheld. His blood pressures will be monitored today, especially since he is on steroids.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. This is likely due to chronic steroid use at home for COPD. Improved electrolytes this morning on higher-dose prednisone suggest that this is improving. Some of the metabolic alkalosis is also compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis given his COPD.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is continued on simvastatin.
