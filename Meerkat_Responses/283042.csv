   CHIEF COMPLAINT: Lcx stenosis
   24 Hour Events:
   67 F with hx CAD s/p RCA and LCx stents, PVD s/p aortobifem bypass and
   R CEA (with 99% restenosis), CHF,ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p ICD
   (previous EF 25%, now 50 %), s/p ICD  who initially presented to [**Hospital **]
   med ctr in [**Month (only) 1340**] with diarrhea and found to have ischemic colitis
   s/p 2 colectomy with 2 colostomies. Sent to [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-22**] and
   refused by that rehab due to TWI V2-V4 on ECG done by EMS enroute,
   unclear why. Sent to LGH and where she  had a trop T 0.18 and flat CKs
   without any symptoms. Was noted to have Course complicated by flash
   pulmonary edema with transfer to CCU. She was subsequently underwent
   diagnostic cath on [**3-27**] showing 80% LCx 80-90% stenosis proximal to
   previous stents and total occlusion RCA with L to R collaterals. She
   has now been transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for interventional cath.
   .
   On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional
   buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
   negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
   .
   On arrival to the CCU HR 80s, BP 110-130s, has TLC. She continued to be
   chest pain free. EKG showed LVH, diffuse TWI and old QW in inferior
   leads. On arrival she was hypotensive with MAPs to 64 howevr was
   asymptomatic. She noted to have nitropaste on, presumably to control
   BP/aferload reduce given recent flash.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic heart failure (CHF) who presented to the hospital for an interventional catheterization following a diagnostic catheterization at an outside hospital. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been asymptomatic since admission. 

The patient's medical history includes recent diagnostic catheterization showing total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and a lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient has undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with stent placement in the RCA and LCx arteries. 

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of venous stasis ulceration in the lower extremities and evidence of intertrigo in the bilateral groin area. 

Laboratory results indicate mild transaminitis with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), likely due to prolonged parenteral nutrition (PPN). 

The patient's current medications include aspirin (ASA), high-dose atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, and lasix. 

The patient's plan includes continuing medical management with ASA, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and spironolactone, while monitoring for any changes in clinical status. The decision regarding the appropriateness of intervention versus medical management will be made based on further evaluation and discussion with the patient. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of ischemic heart disease, development of further peripheral vascular disease, exacerbation of chronic heart failure, and potential complications related to the presence of a colostomy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral artery disease. The patient underwent an elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and was subsequently admitted to the ICU for post-operative care.

24-hour events:
- The patient had a SHEATH procedure performed from 02:00 PM to 07:45 PM, which involved manipulation of the femoral artery.
- During the procedure, the patient experienced a significant drop in blood pressure and heart rate, indicating hypotension and potential vascular injury.
- The patient also developed a groin hematoma, which was treated with a pressure device.
- Following the application of the pressure device, the patient's leg became mottled, cold, and painful, indicating compromised blood flow.
- The patient's blood pressure further dropped to the 60s, and heart rate increased to the 90s, indicating worsening hypotension.
- The pressure device was released, and the patient's symptoms resolved.
- The patient was briefly on levophed and fluids for hypotension.
- The patient's back pain was managed with oxycodone.

Current vital signs:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 86 bpm (normal range: 66-98 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 116/74 mmHg (central arterial BPs significantly higher than noninvasive BPs)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-24 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on nasal cannula

Fluid balance:
- Total input: 1,394 mL
- Total output: 951 mL
- Urine output: 881 mL
- NG output: Not assessed
- Stool output: Not assessed
- Drain output: Not assessed
- Balance: 443 mL

Lab results:
- Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 35.8%
- White blood cell count: 9.4 K/uL
- Platelet count: 346 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
- Troponin T: 0.10 ng/mL
- Glucose: 84 mg/dL
- Other lab results are within normal limits or not significantly abnormal.

Potential complications:
Based on the patient's progress note, the potential complications that can arise include:
1. Vascular injury: The patient experienced a significant drop in blood pressure during the SHEATH procedure, indicating a potential vascular injury. This could lead to compromised blood flow and organ perfusion.
2. Groin hematoma: The patient developed a groin hematoma, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as infection or expansion of the hematoma.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 60s, indicating hypotension. This could be due to the vascular injury or other factors, and it requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and he is on nasal cannula oxygen. Monitoring for any respiratory distress or worsening oxygenation is essential.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly in the groin area where the SHEATH procedure was performed.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and ensuring adequate fluid balance is important.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable at the moment, but close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery (Lcx) stents, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with aortobifemoral bypass, and right carotid endarterectomy (CEA). He also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) that has improved from 25% to 50%. The patient was admitted for an interventional catheterization following a diagnostic catheterization at OSH. He continues to be asymptomatic.

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced several events. Initially, there were noninvasive blood pressures (BPs) that were significantly lower than the central arterial BPs. The patient underwent a femoral artery puncture (BMS to Lcx) and subsequently developed a groin hematoma. A pressure device was applied, but the patient's pulses vanished, and the leg became mottled, cold, and painful. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 60s, and his heart rate increased to the 90s. The pressure device was released, and everything resolved. The patient was briefly on levophed and fluids for hypotension. According to the cardiology fellow who performed the catheterization, the risk of renal pelvic bleed is low.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic heart failure (CHF). She underwent an interventional catheterization procedure yesterday due to total occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA) and a lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCx). A bare metal stent (BMS) was placed in the LCx. Post-procedure, she developed a left groin hematoma requiring compression, followed by pain, mottling of the left leg, and hypotension, which resolved after removing the compression device.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate (HR) of 86 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 116/74 to 57/29 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97% on nasal cannula. She is on several medications including lansoprazole, hydralazine, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), as well as increased levels of troponin-T, creatinine (Cr), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes such"

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient initially experienced hypotension following the development of a groin hematoma, which resolved after the removal of the compression device. Close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac function is necessary to ensure hemodynamic stability.
2. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and underwent an aortobifemoral bypass surgery. It is important to monitor lower extremity pulses and assess for any signs of ischemia or peripheral neuropathy.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient underwent a stent placement in the left coronary artery due to a lesion. Regular monitoring of cardiac enzymes and symptoms of angina or chest pain should be performed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure who underwent an interventional cardiac catheterization. She experienced complications during the procedure, including a groin hematoma that required compression, pain, mottling of the left leg, and hypotension, all of which resolved after removing the compression device. The patient also has a history of ischemic colitis, cholectomy with dual colostomies, and anemia due to iron deficiency. She is currently admitted for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure dropped significantly during the procedure, indicating potential hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate intervention may be necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for developing DVT due to her peripheral vascular disease and immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued to prevent clot formation.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's Foley catheter and recent catheterization procedures increase her risk for developing a UTI. Ciprofloxacin has been prescribed, but close monitoring of urine output, white blood cell count, and urinalysis results is important to detect and manage any potential infection.
4. Wound infection: The patient's abdominal wound from the"
