   vancomycin for HD line infection and MRSA bacteremia.  Also with recent
   history of VRE UTI, klebsiella and proteus UTI.  Patient has recently
   been living at nursing home, was therefore treated broadly overnight
   with linezolid and zosyn for coverage of MRSA and pseudomonas. Will
   discontinue vancomycin  given that patient is presenting with fever on
   vancomycin, we will assume that the infecting microorganism is
   resistant to vancomycin.  Levophed was titrated down overnight.  Blood
   cultures growing gram negative rods, likely source is HD line. Will

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and previous line infections. He is currently being treated for MRSA bacteremia and a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as previous infections with klebsiella and proteus. The patient has been living in a nursing home and presents with fevers, chills, and hypotension.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/fevers: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) and currently being treated with vancomycin for HD line infection and MRSA bacteremia. He has a recent history of VRE UTI, klebsiella, and proteus UTI. The patient has been living at a nursing home, so he was treated broadly overnight with linezolid and zosyn for coverage of MRSA and pseudomonas. Vancomycin will be discontinued due to the patient presenting with fever on vancomycin. Blood cultures growing gram-negative rods, likely source is HD line. The HD line will be pulled today after dialysis, and a temporary line will be placed on Friday.
2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient undergoes HD three times a week (T, Th, Sa), last session was this past Saturday."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and previous line infections. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and presenting with gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. The patient has been on norepinephrine (levophed) at 0.05 mcg/kg/min, and his blood cultures show gram-negative rods, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/48-120/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR Sepsis: The patient continues to be at risk for complications related to GNR bacteremia. Close monitoring of vital signs and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.
2. CKD: The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires ongoing management through hemodialysis sessions on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Considering the recent issues with the tunnelled line, planning for an alternative method of hemodialysis, such as a temporary line, may be necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and previous line infections. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin for MRSA and presenting with gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 103/48 mmHg to 120/78 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.05 mcg/kg/min and receiving prophylactic heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/fevers: The patient continues to be hypotensive and has fevers. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment for infection or other causes of hypotension is necessary.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has a history of line infections and is currently on multiple lines. Regular assessment for signs of infection and consideration of removing any unnecessary lines should be done.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient undergoes hemodialysis three times a week. Monitoring of renal function and adjustment of the dialysis regimen as needed is important.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with fever and hypotension, indicating a possible infection. He was diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and was started on vancomycin. However, he developed a new infection with Gram-negative rods (GNR) from his blood culture, which is believed to be related to his indwelling hemodialysis (HD) catheter. The catheter was removed, and the patient is currently being treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-tazo) for the GNR bacteremia. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 98 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 96/37 mmHg to 120/78 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 92% on nasal cannula. He is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.03 mcg/kg/min for hemodynamic support. His physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the base of the lungs bilaterally, trace edema, and no purulence at the catheter site.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented to the emergency department with fevers, rigors, and hypotension. He was found to have a central line-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and was started on vancomycin as outpatient treatment. In the ICU, the patient developed a peripheral Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia, likely originating from an indwelling hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed. The patient has been receiving norepinephrine for hypotension and has shown improvement in his blood pressure. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 99/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases of both lungs, irregular heart rhythm, trace bilateral edema, and no purulence at the catheter site. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, linezolid, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The plan includes stopping norepineph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the ICU. He recently had a MRSA hospital-acquired (HD) line infection and was treated with vancomycin as an outpatient. The patient presented to the emergency department with fevers, rigors, and hypotension, and was found to have a peripheral Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. The likely source of the infection is the indwelling HD catheter, which was removed on 10/17.

The patient has been receiving norepinephrine (NE) for hemodynamic support, and the goal is to stop NE and maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of > 60 mmHg. The patient has been on piperacillin/tazobactam (Pip-tazo) since 10/16 and will continue for a minimum of two weeks. Linezolid was stopped on 10/18, and vancomycin will be continued to finish the previous MRSA bacteremia.

A plan is in place to replace the central line with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line or determine if the pathogen is ceftazidime/gentamicin, allowing the patient to receive it during hemodialysis (HD). If the culture results remain negative and the renal failure improves, a temporary line may be placed tomorrow for HD. The patient's atr"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of unknown. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 99/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial flutter with a regular rhythm.

The patient has a history of COPD and is currently being treated with antibiotics for GNR bacteremia. The source of the bacteremia is believed to be the patient's hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed on 10/17. The patient is also being treated for renal failure, MRSA bacteremia, and temporary atrial fibrillation.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates a fluid balance of 904 mL in and 432 mL out over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.29.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock due to ongoing bacteremia,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), previous line infections, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) treatment three times a week. He presents with Gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia and sepsis, and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires continuous infusion of norepinephrine. His blood culture results indicate an E. coli infection, and he has not been able to wean off Levophed. The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by his elevated creatinine levels and decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. His electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. The patient also has an elevated lactate level and elevated leukocyte count. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being held due to hypotension. The patient's diastolic CHF is managed with HD for fluid balance. His COPD is being treated with atrovent and spiriva, and he receives CPAP for sleep apnea. The patient has been advised to continue aspirin for his atrial fibr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and previous line infections. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and presents with Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains dependent on norepinephrine for blood pressure maintenance. He is undergoing hemodialysis (HD) three times a week and has an elevated creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR Sepsis: The patient is already being treated with antimicrobial coverage, but there is a need for continued monitoring and adjustment of treatment based on culture sensitivities.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates ongoing kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and continuation of HD sessions are necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is holding lopressor due to hypotension, which may increase the risk of arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of heart rhythm and potential adjustment of anticoagulation therapy should be considered.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient's EF (ejection fraction) is 60%, indicating preserved left ventricular function. However, ongoing monitoring of fluid balance and continued HD sessions are needed to manage diastolic CHF"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) catheter-related bloodstream infection. He presented with fevers, rigors, and hypotension, requiring treatment in the emergency department. The patient's peripheral blood culture grew Gram-negative rods, identified as E. coli, which is believed to be a source of bacteremia. The likely source of infection was an indwelling hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed on [**10-17**].

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-tazo), vancomycin, and linezolid. Vancomycin was stopped on [**10-18**] and the patient will continue with a finishing dose by hemodialysis. Linezolid was also stopped, and vancomycin will be continued to complete the course for previous MRSA bacteremia.

The plan moving forward includes changing the peripheral line to a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line or potentially discontinuing the central line if the pathogen is sensitive to ceftazidime or gentamicin. Once the patient is stable, a temporary line will be placed tomorrow for hemodialysis, with the intention of proceeding directly to a tunneled line.

The patient also has renal failure, atrial fibr"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the ICU for suspected catheter-related sepsis. He is currently on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/56 mmHg to 133/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion and is being closely monitored for hemodynamic stability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with E. coli bacteremia, likely originating from a central venous catheter. It is important to continue aggressive antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESRD. Close monitoring of renal parameters and adjustment of medication dosages accordingly will be necessary.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with ASA. Frequent monitoring of heart rhythm and consideration for anticoagulation may be required.
4. Respiratory Issues: The patient has COPD and is using tiotropium inhaler. Monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been experiencing multiple medical issues. He recently had a MRSA catheter-related bloodstream infection, for which he has been receiving outpatient vancomycin treatment. Currently, he is admitted to the ICU with E. coli bacteremia, likely originating from his hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed on October 17th.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but elevated respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation is within normal range. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) within normal limits, and his fluid balance is relatively stable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid are elevated. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Plan:
The patient's treatment plan includes stopping norepinephrine (NE) and aiming for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 60 mmHg. The initial antibiotic, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), will be continued for 14 days, and the dosage will be adjusted according to his hemodialysis sessions. Linezolid has been discontinued, and vancomycin"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and previous line infections. The patient is currently being treated for gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia, which is resistant to ampicillin and cephalosporins but sensitive to zosyn, tobramycin, gentamicin, and bactrim. The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is undergoing hemodialysis (HD) on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The patient's blood pressure is currently maintained with levophed, and a temporary HD line will be placed today with plans for a permanent line on Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed. The patient is already on appropriate antimicrobial coverage with zosyn, tobramycin, and gentamicin. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any signs of worsening sepsis.

2. CKD: The patient has CKD and requires regular hemodialysis. Complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms can arise if the dialysis sessions are inadequate or if there are issues with the vascular access.

3. Diastolic CHF: The patient has diast"

The patient is an 81-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and previous line infections. He presented with gram-negative bacillus (GNR) bacteremia caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam). The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics including vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and gentamicin for GNR sepsis. He has also been receiving heparin sodium as a prophylactic measure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/55 to 115/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent. His recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and glucose levels, while his platelet count is within normal range. The patient is currently on multiple medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's physical examination revealed no abnormalities in peripheral vascular or neurologic assessments.

He is currently on gentamicin dosed at HD per renal function.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with a normal range of 83-108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/67 mmHg to 88/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute with a normal range of 14-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight/obese appearance, warm skin, attentive neurologic status, and symmetric breath sounds. The patient has absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, slightly low platelet"
