","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer, known metastases to the brain and liver, polycythemia, and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with worsening dyspnea. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been started on empirical antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia. A Pleurex catheter has been considered for reaccumulating effusions, but the patient denied improvement with tapping and no evidence of obstruction was found to warrant stenting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), but there is a possibility of developing a PE due to the patient's history of DVT and lung cancer with known metastases.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with the right side being more prominent. These effusions could lead to respiratory distress or further complications if they continue to reaccumulate.
3. Increased encasement of the right-sided airways by soft tissue density, likely representing tumor involvement. This could cause post-obstructive pneumonia and worsening dyspnea.
4. Diffuse bronchovascular and septal thickening consistent with lymphangitic spread of tumor. This indicates the spread of cancer to the lymphatic system, which can lead to respiratory complications.
5. Stable left lower lobe lung mass and diffuse bony metastases, indicating the progression of the lung cancer.
6. Hepatic metastases"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer, known metastases to the brain and liver, polycythemia, and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with worsening dyspnea.
- The patient is on lovenox for the DVT and has been empirically started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for post-obstructive pneumonia.
- A trans thoracic echo was performed, showing no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), but revealed bilateral pleural effusions, with the right side being more prominent. There is also increased consolidation in the inferior aspect of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe, which could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia or increased tumor burden. Diffuse bronchovascular and septal thickening is consistent with lymphangitic spread of tumor, and stable left lower lobe lung mass and diffuse bony metastases are noted.
- The patient has leukocytosis, cough, subjective fevers at home, and is subjectively improved with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) with stable blood gases.
- The patient's platelet count has dropped from 180 to 115, which is a new finding. His hematocrit (Hct) has also decreased"

The plan includes a thoracentesis and bronchoscopy, and the patient is on empirical coverage for postobstructive pneumonia with Vancomycin and Zosyn. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/67 mmHg to 120/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and has a fluid balance of -1024 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus rhythm with a pulse rate between 83-104 bpm.

The patient has a history of fatigue, dry mouth, orthopnea, dyspnea, tachypnea, and NPO (nothing by mouth). Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted above.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and anxious, with no acute distress. The patient has bilateral crackles on lung auscultation and distant heart sounds with normal S1 and S2. Bowel sounds are present, and there is no peripheral edema or skin changes noted.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with metastatic NSCLC and lymphatic spread of tumor presenting with shortness of breath. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has undergone a thoracentesis and bronchoscopy. He has been placed on Vanco/Zosyn for empiric coverage of postobstructive pneumonia. An echo has been obtained, but the results are pending. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics previously. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 105/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient appears well-nourished and anxious but shows no acute distress. Physical examination reveals dullness on the left side of the chest, crackles bilaterally with more prominence on the right side, and the absence of lower extremity edema. Lab results indicate elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, decreased Plt, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's cancer is being managed with supportive care, and an outpatient PleurX catheter placement is planned for [Month 11]. Thrombocytopenia is also noted, and further investigation is underway. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer, known metastases to the brain and liver, polycythemia, and a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with worsening dyspnea, cough, subjective fevers at home, and leukocytosis. He has undergone thoracentesis with drainage of 1200 ml of serous fluid. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/58 mmHg to 94/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema absence, warm skin, and normal peripheral pulses.

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 106 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 25 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, TCO2 of 27 mmHg, glucose of 123 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. The chest X-ray shows unchanged parenchymal densities consistent with lymphangitis and left-sided pleural effusion. Microbiology cultures are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer, known metastases to the brain and liver, polycythemia vera, and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with worsening dyspnea and has been admitted to the ICU.

24-hour events include non-invasive ventilation, blood cultures, urine culture, thoracentesis with removal of 1200 ml serous fluid, pain at procedure site, restarted lovenox, and hemodynamic monitoring.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/58 to 94/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals thinness, warm skin, and no lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate pancytopenia, leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Imaging shows parenchymal densities consistent with lymphangitis and a left-sided pleural effusion. Microbiology cultures are pending.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pancytopenia: likely secondary to chemotherapy and possible vancomycin use.
2. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung: worsening dyspnea likely due to lymphangitic spread and re-accumulation of pleural fluids."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for further management. She has been experiencing fever, bronchospasm with airway narrowing due to tumor compression in the left upper lobe of the right lung. The patient has received chemotherapy and had a bilateral thoracentesis. A right-sided pleurex catheter is being considered when fluid reaccumulates. Brachytherapy for airway obstruction by IP is also being considered. There is a possibility of repeat USG to rule out deep vein thrombosis due to right upper extremity swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever, which may indicate an ongoing infection. This could be secondary to postobstructive pneumonia or a result of the bronchoscopy procedure. Current antibiotics are being administered, and cultures are being monitored.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient continues to be monitored for pancytopenia, a condition characterized by a reduction in red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can be a complication of chemotherapy.
3. Cancer Progression: The patient has lung cancer, and there is ongoing consideration for additional treatments such as brachytherapy to manage airway obstruction caused by the tumor.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient has had a bilateral thoracentesis, indicating the presence of pleural effusion. A right-sided pleurex catheter is being"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation due to airway obstruction caused by the tumor. She underwent bilateral thoracentesis and is being considered for a right-sided pleurex catheter placement when fluid reaccumulates. The patient has pancytopenia as a result of recent chemotherapy and is also experiencing fever, which may be secondary to postobstructive pneumonia or a bronchoscopy procedure. Her laboratory results show elevated bilirubin levels, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she does have crackles and wheezes bilaterally in her lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's airway obstruction due to the tumor poses a significant risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and prompt intervention are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The presence of fever and the potential for postobstructive pneumonia or secondary infection from bronchoscopy procedures increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, white blood cell count, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent or manage any potential infections.

3. Bleeding: Pancytopenia caused by chemotherapy increases the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of platelet count and careful management of invasive procedures are essential to minimize the risk of bleeding complications.

4. Hepatic dysfunction: Elevated bilir"
