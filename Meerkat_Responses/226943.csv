   ProBNP: [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]
   Microbiology:
   Blood Cultures ([**6-20**]): Pending
   Studies:
   CT Head [**6-20**]: No acute intracranial process.
   ECHO [**6-20**]: The right atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15%). Moderate to severe (3+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen.
   CXR [**6-20**]: Marked cardiomegaly, with patchy perihilar opacities most
   consistent with pulmonary edema. There are accompanying small
   effusions. 2. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position 6 cm above the
   carina.
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less)
   - start Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope (and stop dopamine when start
   milrinone)
   - add neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags and closely follow K
   (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult today, will follow on their recs
   - ECHO
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become
   coagulopathic on cooling protocol
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Start milrinone/neo/lasix as above
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   with PH 7.32/41/104. FI02 decreased to 70 %
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as noted above.
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and mitral valve repair, who was found unresponsive and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest. The patient has been intubated and is currently on a cooling protocol and pressor support. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 34.8°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 87/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, plateau pressure of 26 cmH2O, and compliance of 34.4 mL/cmH2O. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin and digoxin. The most recent electrocardiogram (ECG) showed resolution of global wide complex tachycardia in limb leads. The patient's baseline rhythm was atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, and he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and lactate, as well as a slightly elevated B-type natri"

   mitral regurgitation is seen.
   CXR [**6-20**]: Marked cardiomegaly, with patchy perihilar opacities most
   consistent with pulmonary edema. There are accompanying small
   effusions. 2. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position 6 cm above the

   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - start Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope (and stop dopamine when start
   milrinone)
   - add neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes on cooling protocol, including coags and closely follow K
   (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - formal EP consult today, will follow on their recs
   - ECHO
   - Continue cooling protocol with time of goal temperature reached at
   8:30pm. Cool for 18-24hrs, then rewarm slowly), then after patient
   warmed do thorough neuro exam to assess residual functional status
   - order for continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - f/u Utox screen
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - EP consult in AM
   - IV amio bolus prn return to fast VT
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and pts become
   coagulopathic on cooling protocol
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Start milrinone/neo/lasix as above
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   with PH 7.32/41/104. FI02 decreased to 70 %
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as noted above.
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was found unresponsive and subsequently underwent cardiac arrest from an unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD firing and ACLS/CPR. He is currently intubated, on a cooling protocol, and pressor support.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise based on the provided information. These include:

1. Rhythm/ Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's ECG showed irregular wide complex tachycardia, which is concerning for polymorphic VT with possible positive concordance. This rhythm required shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. The patient's baseline rhythm was atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, and he was on coumadin and digoxin. Recent INR was therapeutic, but compliance with medications is unclear. Further monitoring on telemetry, EP consult in AM, IV amio bolus as needed for return to fast VT, and following electrolytes closely are recommended.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt.  Hypotensive with
   MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for
   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy. Stopped milrinone
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Neuro- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  re-start milrinone as needed; consider amiodorone
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs; call back when all
   sedation is out of system
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatic heart disease. He was found unresponsive and underwent cardiac arrest, resulting in multiple rounds of ICD firing and ACLS/CPR. He is currently intubated and on pressor support.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Wide complex tachycardia with possible polymorphic VT, requiring shocks and ACLS/CPR.
2. Decompensated systolic CHF with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR, and LE edema.
3. Acute renal failure with increased creatinine from 1.2 to 1.9.
4. Metabolic acidosis with primary AG metabolic acidosis, likely lactic acidosis, and acute respiratory acidosis.
5. Myoclonus and decreased cortical activity, requiring sedation restart.
6. Leucocytosis with a WBC count of 12.2, possibly due to stress response or infection.
7. Coagulation disorder with an INR of 6.5, receiving vitamin K.
8. Increased risk of infection due to femoral line placement.
9. Pain management with fentanyl/versed and weaning as tolerated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances, digoxin toxicity, or ICD malfunction.
2. Worsening heart failure symptoms and fluid overload.
3. Acute kidney injury leading to further deterioration of renal function.
4. Metabolic acidosis progressing to severe acidemia.
5. Infection due to prolonged ICU stay, invasive lines, and immunosuppression.
6. Bleeding complications due to coagulation disorder and anticoagulant therapy.
7. Neurological complications such as seizures or further decrease in cortical activity.
8. Poor glycemic control and associated complications.
9. Pressure injuries and musculoskeletal complications due to prolonged immobility.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information, and a thorough evaluation of the patient by healthcare professionals is necessary for accurate assessments and appropriate management."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt.  Hypotensive with
   MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for
   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Continued Lasix drip anyway just in case he starts
   responding to it.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy.  Decreased milrinone
   and held it for a few hours overnight - not on any now.  Weaned
   sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having facial
   twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount of
   versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing

   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, on cooling protocol and pressor
   support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented with unresponsiveness and was found to have ventricular fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest. After resuscitation, he was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with decompensated systolic heart failure, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. He also has hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and is receiving inotropic support with milrinone and vasopressor support with neosynephrine. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of severe cardiomyopathy and recent cardiac arrest, there is a high risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if he continues to be hypotensive or if his cardiac output does not improve.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if his lung function does not improve or if there is an increase in pulmonary edema.
4. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low cardiac output and hypotension indicate a possibility of cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening.
5. Infection: Due to the patient's prolonged ICU"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt.  Hypotensive with
   MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for
   hypotension.  Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Continued Lasix drip anyway just in case he starts
   responding to it.  Patient having LOTS of ectopy.  Decreased milrinone
   and held it for a few hours overnight - not on any now.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming.
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.

   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Neuro- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on

   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 3.3 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, chronic renal insufficiency, and a recent cardiac arrest. The patient is currently intubated, on pressor support, and being treated in the ICU. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, oliguria (low urine output), hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and evidence of acute renal failure. The patient also has an elevated BNP level indicating decompensated heart failure. The patient's rhythm is currently atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing. The patient has a history of cocaine use and digoxin toxicity, but these were ruled out as the cause of the cardiac arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to decompensated heart failure and severe cardiomyopathy.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to fluid overload and hypoxemia.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion and potential use of nephrotoxic drugs.
4. Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation due to electrolyte imbalances and underlying cardiac conditions.
5. Infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous cath"

   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q4hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR - if no longer therapeutic then
   start SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl/versed and wean as tolerated

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, chronic renal insufficiency, and cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU for ongoing management of his condition.

Summary of Progress:
- Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix yesterday.
- Hypotensive with MAP's ~55. Neosynephrine increased throughout the day for hypotension.
- Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later. Had increased ectopy with warming. Patient having LOTS of ectopy so milrinone stopped; gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing.
- Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of hypotension.
- Cr: 5am 2.3, 10am 2.5, 2pm 2.7, 6pm 2.9, 10pm 3.0, this AM 3.5 (not urinating at all).
- Weaned sedation overnight. Without versed, patient started having facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation. Put small amount of versed back on board. Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted: states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.
- K: 5am 4.2, 10am 4.5 (gave 20mEq po crushed via NGT), 2pm 4.3, 6pm 4.1 (gave 20mEq), 10pm 4.3; this AM 4.4.
- ABG's: 7.38/30/178/18/-5 then 7.36/33/159/19/-5 (turned down FiO2 and RR).
- WBC 10.9, 12.2.
- Hct 35.0.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmia/Palpitations: The patient has a history of severe cardiomyopathy and rheumatic heart disease, which increases the risk of arrhythmias. He experienced wide complex tachycardia and episodes of unresponsiveness, possibly due to polymorphic VT or VF. The patient is currently on digoxin and coumadin, which can also contribute to arrhythmias. Close monitoring of ECGs and electrolyte levels is important.

2. Myoclonus/Seizures: The patient is experiencing myoclonus, which can be a sign of decreased cortical activity. Sedation has been restarted to prevent further episodes. It is important to assess the patient's neurological status and consider further EEG monitoring.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.2 to 1.9, indicating possible acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic renal failure. The lack of urine output suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal consult for possible hemodialysis are necessary.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with a triple acid-base disorder, including primary AG metabolic acidosis, non-gap metabolic acidosis, and respiratory acidosis. The ABG has slightly improved"

   the upper stomach, no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Pleural
   effusions are small if any. Severe cardiomegaly and enlarged pulmonary
   arteries are longstanding. Transvenous right ventricular pacer
   defibrillator, right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads are
   unchanged in standard placements continuous from the right axillary
   power pack. Two remnant left-sided leads end in the right atrium and
   right ventricle respectively. No pneumothorax
   Assessment and Plan
   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, has been cooled and rewarmed.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity.  Currently on
   only neosynephrine, have weaned sedation and milrinone, and stopped
   lasix.
   - try to restart milrinone to see if it increases inotropy (will
   restart without bolus because milrinone renally cleared)
   - if increased ectopy, can start him on amiodarone through the NGT
   (although a balance because likely shock liver and amiodarone may not
   be well tolerated)
   - keep in touch with neuro regarding brain activity
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - continue to use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting
   of milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - continuous EEG monitor
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline.   Now with significant ectopy overnight.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue Beta blocker for rhythm control
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)

   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue neosynephrine, retry milrinone as above
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Will give FFP and put in central IJ line for access, as femoral line
   has large risk of infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was found unresponsive and experienced cardiac arrest, requiring resuscitation and intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including rhythm/wide complex tachycardia, pump/decompensated systolic CHF, coronary artery disease, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, acute on chronic renal failure, and leucocytosis. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm/ Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's ECGs show irregular wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible positive concordance. This requires continuous monitoring on telemetry, aggressive repletion of potassium (>5.0), magnesium (>2), and follow-up of INR. Beta-blockers will be continued for rhythm control.
2. Pump/ Decompensated Systolic CHF: The patient has known severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10-15%. There is evidence of increased lower extremity edema, elevated JVD, effusion on CXR, and BNP of 7772. Neosynephrine and milrinone will be continued. Metoprolol will also be continued to aid with ectopy.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix gtt yesterday.
    Hypotensive with MAP's ~55.  Neosynephrine increased throughout the
   day for hypotension.  .  Phenylep. Maxed at 5 now at 4.
   - Warming started 2:30pm, finished 6 hours later.  Had increased ectopy
   with warming. Patient having LOTS of ectopy so milrinone stopped;
   - Gave metoprolol 2.5mg IV x 2 for ectopy, and 12.5mg po bid standing
   Not putting out ANY urine, likely ATN in the setting of hypotension
   20cc/hour of lasix, since no UOP; stopped secondary to increasing fluid
   input and not able to diurese; and consider bolusing prn
   - Cr: 5am 2.3, 10am 2.5, 2pm 2.7, 6pm 2.9, 10pm 3.0 , this AM 3.5 (not

    Weaned sedation overnight.  Without versed, patient started having
   facial twitching and myoclonus with any provocation.  Put small amount
   of versed back on board.  Still on some fentanyl. Neurology consulted:
   states myoclonus is not seizure activity; none seen; if want to assess
   further cortical activity, attempt to lift sedation.

   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST: Unclear precipitant, but etiologies of arrhythmia
   include electrolyte abnomalities such as hypokalemia, BiV/ICD
   anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide complex tachycardia for
   sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in setting of dig toxicity or
   possible cocaine use. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight ICD
   interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of ineffective ATP leading to
   shock with one episode at 11am, and one at 4:46pm which may correlate
   with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness. Initial lytes showed
   hypokalemia, acidemia. Utox for cocaine and dig level pending. No
   evidence of ACS as etiology. Patient s/p multiple episodes of loss of
   pulse with wide complex tachycardia, so started on cooling protocol
   overnight. Family aware of critical status.  He did not have goot urine
   output overnight, and therefore he likely needs inotropes in order to
   increase contractility and cardiac output in order to accurately
   diurese with Lasix.
   - will keep K>5.0 in order to prevent arrhythmias (about 80mEq of K
   today as long as creatinine stable or less, will check 10am)
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - will use beta-blockers to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of
   milrinone
   - Q8hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs
   - ECHO: EF of [**9-24**]%
   - continuous EEG monitor, neuro will be following
   - Utox screen shows no drug etiologies
   - defibrillator pads in place
   - patient on IV steroid clinical trial per protocol
   .
   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  re-start milrinone as needed; consider amiodorone
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC CHF: Patient with known severe
   cardiomyopathy from valvular dz/NYHA IV sCHF with EF 10-15%. Followed
   by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic. Recent OMR notes indicate increase
   in LE edema suggesting decompensated heart failure with plan for
   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo/lasix as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize, consider a-line
   placement in AM
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Patient initial ABG of 7.16/32/189 showed triple
   acid base disorder of primary AG metabolic acidosis likely [**1-8**] lactic
   acidosis and acute renal failure, with concomitant non gap metabolic
   acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from
   hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). Slightly improved after intubation,
   possible fluids in ED. Initial lactate 5.6, Cr up from 1.2-> 1.9
   overnight. ABG improving as well as lactate
   -          follow ABGs or VBG
s, adjust ventilator settings, follow
   lactate/renal function.
   -          Replete lytes. Hold on fluids given patient appears volume
   overloaded.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased to 1.9 from baseline of
   1.2-1.6. Likely in setting of poor forward flow during cardiac arrest
   in patient with low EF; NO UOP; likely ATN
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor UOP
   - send Ulytes, and check LFT
   - Consider renal consult for possible HD
   #Myoclonus- patient with myoclonus and decreased cortical activity on
   sedation; sedation now stopped;
          -       Re-start sedation if patient cannot tolerate
   -          Neuro consulting and appreciate recs; call back when all
   sedation is out of system
   #Leucocytosis- WBC: 12.2; likely stress response but cannot rule out
   infection
   -          Blood cultures and re-check this afternoon
   -          If positive, consider antibiotics
   # Coagulation: INR 6.5 this AM; started 5 mg of Vitamin K;
          -        Continue to monitor and give vitamin K for the next
   three days.
   # ACCESS: Currently has R femoral line placed in the ED.  Also with an
   INR of 6.5 this morning.  Although femoral lines represent an increased
   risk of infection, at this time the risks of putting a new line in with
   an increased INR outweigh the benefits at this time.
   - Keep femoral line for now.
   - When patient
s INR decreases, will change to different access
   ..
   PROPHYLAXIS:

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was found unresponsive and underwent resuscitation efforts, including multiple rounds of ICD firing and ACLS/CPR. The patient is currently intubated, on pressor support, and has multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of severe cardiomyopathy and is on digoxin and coumadin. The presence of hypokalemia and acidemia raises concerns for arrhythmias. The patient's ECGs show wide complex tachycardia, which could be polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation. Appropriate monitoring, electrolyte repletion, and anti-arrhythmic medications may be necessary.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.2-1.6 and has further increased to 1.9. There is no urine output reported, suggesting possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly. Consideration for renal consultation and dialysis may be required.

3. Myoclonus: The patient is experiencing myoclonus, which is involuntary muscle twitching. This could be due to decreased cortical activity. Neurological consultation is needed"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status, diabetes mellitus type II, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered nutrition. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving milrinone infusion at 0.25 mcg/kg/min, which was increased to 0.375 mcg/kg/min and then decreased back to 0.25 mcg/kg/min due to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient is also receiving phenylephrine at 4 mcg/kg/min. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/59 mmHg to 78/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates an arterial line and a multi-lumen central venous line.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. The coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and elevated D-dimer levels, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The fibrinogen level is also decreased.

   73M with h/o severe cardiomyopathy (EF [**9-19**]) s/p biV/ICD ([**2115**]),  afib
   on coumadin and dig, rheumatic heart disease s/p mitral valve repair in
   [**2109**] with residual 3+ MR, CRI, h/o CVA who was found unreponsive and
   s/p cardiac arrest from unknown etiology with multiple rounds of ICD
   firing and ACLS/CPR now intubated, pressor support.
   .
   # s/p CARDIAC ARREST/ Cardiogenic Shock: Unclear precipitant, but
   etiologies of arrhythmia include electrolyte abnomalities such as
   hypokalemia, BiV/ICD anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) inducing wide
   complex tachycardia for sensed atrial tachycardia, or arrythmia in
   setting of dig toxicity. Likely multifactorial as hypokalemia lowers
   threshold for arrythmias, predisposes to dig toxicity. By overnight  on
   day of admission ICD interrogation, patient had 6 episodes of
   ineffective ATP leading to shock with one episode at 11am, and one at
   4:46pm which may correlate with patient's episodes of unresponsiveness.
   Initial lytes showed hypokalemia, acidemia. No evidence of ACS as
   etiology.  Patient stable hemodynamically on milrinone and neo. Will
   attempt to wean
   - Continue Milrinone gtt to act as inotrope
   - Continue neosynephrine as needed to support blood pressure
   - Metoprolol and Amiodorone to prevent increased NSVT
   - when milrinone/neo have taken effect, start Lasix gtt in order to
   diurese
   - Q12hr lytes, including coags and closely follow K (will maintain
   >5.0)
   - cardiac arrest team and Neuro EEG ICU team aware and will be
   following patient, appreciate recs

   # RHYTHM/WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA: Patient's ECGs showing irregular
   wide complex tachycardia concerning for polymorphic VT with possible
   positive concordance, which went in/out of pulseless VT/VF requiring
   shocks/ACLS/CPR for regaining of pulse. Unclear what rhythm patient in
   when pacer initiated ATP/shock and whether was appropriate. Currently
   patient with pulse, on pressor support. Patient's baseline rhythm was
   afib with ventricular pacing, BiV/ICD in place. On coumadin and digoxin
   at baseline. Recent INR was therapeutic, unclear compliance with
   medications.
   -  Give milrinone to smallest effective dose;
   -  Continue amiodorone po, and consider amio gtt if milrinone is to be
   increased
   -  monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Beta blocker
   - follow lytes closely, aggressively replete K (>5.0), Mg (>2)
   - follow INR, hold coumadin as supratherapeutic on admission
   - hold carvedilol while patient on pressor support
   - Hold Digoxin for now.

   increase in lasix, but unclear if patient had been taking this. By
   exam, patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR,
   and LE edema. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7772**]. Given 20mg IV lasix overnight with only 50cc
   of urine produced.
   - Continue milrinone/neo as above and wean off as tolerated
   - Hold carvedilol for now.
   - Hold Digoxin for now.
   - Continue metoprolol to aid with ectopy
   - Hold lasix for now as patient is not making much urine
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD or risk factors. Clean coronaries on last
   cath [**2114**]. No h/o chest pain, no indication of ACS as cause of cardiac
   arrest at this time. Enzymes: CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:116/7/0.10;
   22/12.2/0.35; 22/12.2/0.29;
   - follow ECGs
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient intubated in setting of unresponsiveness
   and cardiac arrest. No known pulmonary history, but may be component of
   fluid overload from decompensated heart failure. ABG improved this AM
   - continue intubated for now, adjust vent settings to improve
   oxygenation
   - follow ABGs, and if INR continues to normalize,
   - diuresis with IV lasix as above
   - Wean ssedation as tolerated
   .

   overnight by cardiac arrest team.
   Code status: FULL CODE confirmed with family, ICU consent signed
   Disposition: CCU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with severe cardiomyopathy and a history of cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU and has been intubated, placed on pressor support, and receiving inotropic therapy with milrinone. The patient's condition is complicated by wide complex tachycardia, decompensated systolic CHF, possible acute on chronic renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and DIC. The patient's sedation has been stopped to assess myoclonus and decreased cortical activity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's ECGs show irregular wide complex tachycardia, which is concerning for polymorphic VT with possible positive concordance. This requires continuous monitoring and management with appropriate antiarrhythmic medications.
2. Decompensated Systolic CHF: The patient has a history of severe cardiomyopathy with an EF of 10-15%. His recent OMR notes indicate an increase in lower extremity edema, suggesting decompensated heart failure. The patient appears hypervolemic with elevated JVD, effusion on CXR, and LE edema. BNP level is significantly elevated. Management should include diuretics, inotropic support, and adjustment of medications.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's Cr has increased from 1.2 to 1.9 overnight. This could be due to poor forward flow during cardiac arrest in a patient with low EF, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Minimizing fluid intake, following Cr levels, and considering renal consult for possible HD are important considerations.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a triple acid-base disorder with primary AG metabolic acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis and acute renal failure. There is also concomitant non-gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis (from hypoventilation/unresponsiveness). ABG improvement indicates positive steps taken.
5. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has an elevated INR of 6.5 and a DIC panel suggestive of DIC. FFP has been given during IJ placement, which helped improve the condition. Monitoring DIC labs and providing FFP as needed, along with vitamin K for the next three days, is recommended.
6. Shock Liver: The patient's AST/ALT levels were increased during admission, raising concern for shock liver. However, decreasing numbers suggest it is unlikely to be shock liver at this time. Daily monitoring of AST/ALT is advised.
7. Prophylaxis: Prophylactic measures include DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR, pain management with fentanyl/versed, and weaning as tolerated.

   Disposition: CCU for now
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and mitral valve repair. He was found unresponsive and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest from an unknown etiology. The patient has been intubated and is on pressor support. 

The patient has multiple medical complications that require immediate attention. These include rhythm issues with wide complex tachycardia, decompressed systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, acute on chronic renal failure, myoclonus, leucocytosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and shock liver.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased levels of lactate, elevated creatinine, and abnormal coagulation parameters consistent with DIC. The patient's ABG values indicate metabolic acidosis, and his renal function is compromised.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, further cardiac arrhythmias, progression of renal dysfunction, development of infections, ongoing metabolic acidosis, and the possibility of bleeding due to DIC.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamics"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and previous cardiac arrest. He presented with unresponsiveness and was found to have a cardiac arrest, requiring ACLS/CPR. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving inotropic support with milrinone and vasopressor support with neo. He also has wide complex tachycardia, possibly non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and is being treated with amiodarone. The patient has acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and elevated D-dimer levels suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He is also at risk for shock liver and pulmonary embolism due to immobilization. The patient's family has been informed about the situation, and code status has been discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low ejection fraction (EF) of 10-15% and severe cardiomyopathy put him at risk for cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and continued use of inotropic and vasopressor support are necessary.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current presentation with wide complex tachycardia indicate a risk for arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of the ECG and administration of antiarrhythmic medications are needed.
