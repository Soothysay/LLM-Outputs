   Ms. [**Known lastname 51**] is a 75F with COPD, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation who is
   ventilator dependent and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP evaluation of
   ?tracheostomy leak.
   .
   1. ?Trach leak-Could be related to tracheomalacia vs. malpositioning of
   tube to explain low tidal volumes.
   - IP recommendations appreciated-will eval patient today, if unable to
   do bedside procedure, will discuss with ENT
   - Cuff pressure decreased to 15 cc from 23 and tidal volume increased
   to 550.
   - check VBG in afternoon if concern for not ventilating well
   - F/u on CXR read

   2. Chronic respiratory failure-unclear why patient having difficulty
   weaning from vent.  [**Known lastname 51**] have underlying neuromuscular disease given
   generalized weakness.  She also has a history of CHF which [**Known lastname **] be
   contributing.  Patient does also appear thin, [**Known lastname **] have decreased muscle
   mass in setting of poor nutrition. Also complicated by presence of
   possible aspiration pneumonia per OSH records.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, who is ventilator dependent and admitted to the ICU for evaluation of tracheostomy leak. The patient has multiple medical complications including chronic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, leukocytosis with positive cultures for MRSA, E. coli, and Enterococcus, urinary tract infection (UTI), anxiety and depression, seizures, anemia, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure (CHF), and a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Tracheostomy leak: The patient may experience further respiratory distress or difficulty weaning off the ventilator if the tracheostomy leak is not properly managed.
2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying neuromuscular disease, poor nutrition, history of CHF, and possible aspiration pneumonia contribute to the difficulty in weaning off the ventilator. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function and potential need for long-term ventilation.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient is at risk for recurrent or worsening aspiration pneumonia due to her underlying COPD, neuromuscular disease, and possible malpositioning of the tracheostomy tube.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis with positive cultures for multiple organisms indicates a potential bacterial infection. There is a risk of sepsis or worsening of the current infections"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently intubated and ventilator-dependent, admitted to the ICU for an evaluation of tracheostomy leak. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/53 mmHg to 145/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals generalized weakness, ecchymosis from injection sites, and a tracheostomy in place. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including potassium, sodium, and chloride.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tracheostomy leak - The patient's ventilator dependence and low tidal volumes may indicate a tracheostomy leak, which could be related to tracheomalacia or malpositioning of the tube.
2. Chronic respiratory failure - The patient is having difficulty weaning off the ventilator, possibly due to chronic respiratory failure and the presence of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Leukocytosis - The elevated white blood cell count suggests an infection, with cultures positive for MRSA, E. coli, and Enterococcus. The patient"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 51**] is a 75F with COPD, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation who is
   ventilator dependent and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP evaluation of
   ?tracheostomy leak.
   .
   1. ?Trach leak-Could be related to tracheomalacia vs. malpositioning of
   tube to explain low tidal volumes.
   - IP recommendations appreciated-will eval patient today, if unable to
   do bedside procedure, will discuss with ENT
   - Cuff pressure decreased to 15 cc from 23 and tidal volume increased
   to 550.
   - check VBG in afternoon if concern for not ventilating well
   - F/u on CXR read
   .
   2. Chronic respiratory failure-unclear why patient having difficulty
   weaning from vent.  [**Known lastname 51**] have underlying neuromuscular disease given
   generalized weakness.  She also has a history of CHF which [**Known lastname **] be
   contributing.  Patient does also appear thin, [**Known lastname **] have decreased muscle
   mass in setting of poor nutrition. Also complicated by presence of
   possible aspiration pneumonia per OSH records.
   -Aspiration precautions
   -F/u CXR
   -Sputum/blood Cx

   3. Leukocytosis-Could be related to multiple organisms, is culture
   positive for MRSA, E coli, and Enterococcus.  She [**Known lastname **] have C diff,
   though denies much beyond minimally loose stools.  Was hypoxic today
   for unclear reasons, and [**Known lastname **] have a HAP, though not having sputum
   production or cough.
   -Continue Vanc/Flagyl/cipro
   -F/u Cx
   - Follow fever curve, re culture if spikes
   4. COPD
   -Continue Fluticasone and albuterol

   5. Atrial fibrillation-Not currently rate controlled via medication.
   Currently on ASA 81 mg, but no further anticoagulation
   -Continue ASA 81 mg
   .
   6. ? G tube leak-per OSH records though unclear where-no evidence of
   leaking around stoma, dressing dry.
   -check residuals when TF restarted, holding for now in setting of
   possible procedure

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, who is ventilator dependent and admitted for evaluation of tracheostomy leak.
- The patient has chronic respiratory failure, possibly due to neuromuscular disease, CHF, poor nutrition, and aspiration pneumonia.
- She also has leukocytosis with multiple organism infections, including MRSA, E. coli, and Enterococcus. She has C. difficile infection, hypoxia, and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient has a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, G-tube leak, UTI, anxiety and depression, seizures, anemia, hypothyroidism, CHF, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Tracheostomy leak: If not managed properly, it can lead to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory distress.
2. Chronic respiratory failure: It can result in further respiratory compromise and potential need for long-term mechanical ventilation.
3. Infections: The presence of multiple organism infections and C. difficile can worsen if not appropriately treated, leading to sepsis and systemic complications.
4. Aspiration pneumonia: If not prevented or treated effectively, it can progress to lung abscesses or bronchiectasis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 51**] is a 75F with COPD, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation who is
   ventilator dependent and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP evaluation of ?
   tracheostomy leak.
   .
   1. Trach leak:  Most likely related to tracheomegaly, unclear reason.
   IP on board.  Plan for rigid bronchoscopyto evaluate for tracheomalacia
   vs. malpositioning of tube to explain low tidal volumes.
   -Insert larger Trach, can also pack with saline soaked guaze, but did
   not want skin breakdown, so will hold off for now.
   -Treat air hunger with morphine PRN
   .
   2. Respiratory failure:  The patient reported worsening respiratory
   distress today and overnight.  CXR this AM showed evidence of left lung
   collapse.  Other complicating factors [**Known lastname **] be possible underlying
   neuromuscular disease given generalized weakness, history of CHF and
   possible aspiration pneumonia per OSH records.
   -Bronch showed extensive mucus likely cause for collaps
   -F/u cx + for pseudomonas resistant to cipro
   -Started Doripax/Ceftaz Day 1=[**2201-1-26**]
   -Hold on diuretics as urine out put adequate
   -Continue aspiration precautions
   .
   3. Leukocytosis:  Likely secondary to HAP by evidenced on CXR.
   Possible organisms are multiple given OSH records of MRSA, E coli, and
   Enterococcus, will attempt to get those records.  C diff unlikely,
   denies much beyond minimally loose stools.
   - Treat with double coverage for pseudomonas as above
   - Follow cultures
   - Follow fever curve and leukocytosis
   4. COPD-Stable
    -Continue Fluticasone and albuterol
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation
 not currently requiring medication for rate
   control.  Will start beta blockers as needed.  Currently on ASA 81 mg,
   but no further anticoagulation
   .
   6. ? G tube leak-per OSH records though unclear where-no evidence of
   leaking around stoma, dressing dry.
   - check residuals once tube feeding again
   .
   7. UTI-UA positive on admission despite records indicating treatment
   with linezolid and ceftriaxone(in med list on transfer ceftriaxone not
   recorded)  Patient was previously culture positive for E.facelis and
   E.coli
   -Follow cultures and adjust antibiotics accordingly
   -f/u sensitivities from OSH
   - Continue cipro
   .
   8. Anxiety and Depression-currently stabilized on current regimen
   follwed by psych  NP[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5283**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5284**]
   -Continue Klonopin, Cymbalta, Seroquel, with PRN Seroquel for anxiety
   .
   9. Seizures-patient denies having seizures as does daughter does not
   recall any episodes either . Documented in records from outside.
   Currently stable
   -Continue neurontin
   -Monitor neuro status
   .
   10. Anemia-3 point drop from yesterday, but no identifiable source of
   bleeding.
   -Follow HCT, check Fe, B12, folate
   -PM HCT tonight
   11. Hypothyroidism
   -Continue synthroid
   .
   12. CHF-last EF not documented in notes
   -Attempt to get outside records indicating degree of failure and adjust
   fluids as needed
   -Obtain ECHO, as CHF and fluid in lungs [**Known lastname **] contribute to difficulty
   weaning vent.
   .
   13. Sacral decubitus ulcer-currently stage II per nursing staff
   -continue to monitor
   -daily wound care
   FEN-Hold Nocturnal TF and regular thin liquid diet in setting of
   possible procedure-restart today

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname, 51] is a 75-year-old female patient with a history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, who is currently ventilator-dependent and admitted to the ICU for an evaluation of tracheostomy leak. The patient has multiple comorbidities and complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, leukocytosis, chronic urinary tract infection (UTI), anemia, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure (CHF), and sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheostomy leak: The patient is experiencing a tracheostomy leak, which may be related to tracheomegaly or malpositioning of the tube. A rigid bronchoscopy is planned to evaluate for tracheomalacia or malpositioning of the tube.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient reported worsening respiratory distress, and a chest X-ray showed evidence of left lung collapse. Extensive mucus was seen on bronchoscopy, likely causing the collapse. The patient has been started on doripax/ceftazidime for possible pseudomonas infection.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Multiple organisms, including MRSA, E. coli, and Enterococcus, have been identified in OSH records. The patient is being treated with double coverage for pseudomonas.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient's condition has progressed with the identification of pneumonia, likely hospital-acquired given the timing. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and has a urinary tract infection. Leukocytosis is present, indicating an elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia can worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may progress, resulting in decreased oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The UTI may spread to other organs, leading to systemic infection and sepsis.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an active infection, but if not managed appropriately, it could lead to complications such as abscess formation or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged mechanical ventilation. This can result in gastrointestinal bleeding if not managed with appropriate prophylaxis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory problems and was placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by hospital-acquired pneumonia and a urinary tract infection.

24-hour events:
- Chest X-ray showed left lung collapse and bronchoscopy showed thick secretions.
- Gram stain of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) identified gram-negative rods.
- Antibiotics were restarted with zosyn for double coverage of gram-negative rods, and flagyl was discontinued as it is not needed for aspiration coverage with zosyn.
- Morphine was given for air hunger, and ativan was administered because the patient continued to feel dyspneic. However, tidal volumes were in the 300's, and oxygen saturation (O2 sat) was 97-98%. Suctioning did not show significant improvement.

Allergies:
The patient is allergic to midazolam.

Last dose of antibiotics:
- Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) was given on 01/24/2022 at 10:07 AM.
- Metronidazole was given on 01/25/2022 at 05:30 PM.
- Vancomycin was given on 01/25/2022 at 08:00 PM.
- Ciprofloxacin was given on"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 51**] is a 75F with COPD, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation who is
   ventilator dependent and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP evaluation of ?
   tracheostomy leak.
   .
   1. Trach leak:  Most likely related to tracheomegaly, unclear reason.
   IP on board.  Plan for rigid bronchoscopy tomorrow to evaluate for
   tracheomalacia vs. malpositioning of tube to explain low tidal volumes.
   .
   2. Respiratory failure:  The patient reported worsening respiratory
   distress today and overnight.  CXR this AM showed evidence of left lung
   collapse.  Other complicating factors [**Known lastname **] be possible underlying
   neuromuscular disease given generalized weakness, history of CHF and
   possible aspiration pneumonia per OSH records.
   - Bronch today for mucus removal, likely cause of left lung collapse.
   - continue aspiration precautions
   - follow sputum and blood Cx, repeat sputum culture today and BAL.
   - Abx-continue vanc/flagyl/cipro-Day 1=[**1-23**], d/c
ed zosyn yesterday
   - consider neuromuscular eval to work up global weakness
   - nutrition recs
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Will use morphine for air hunger, consider aerosolized lasix
   .
   3. Leukocytosis:  Likely secondary to HAP by evidenced on CXR.
   Possible organisms are multiple given OSH records of MRSA, E coli, and
   Enterococcus, will attempt to get those records.  C diff unlikely,
   denies much beyond minimally loose stools.
   - Continue Vanc/Flagyl/cipro for empiric coverage, will narrow based on
   speciation and sensitivities
   - Follow cultures
   - Follow fever curve and leukocytosis
   4. COPD -Continue Fluticasone and albuterol
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation
 not currently requiring medication for rate
   control.  Will start beta blockers as needed.  Currently on ASA 81 mg,
   but no further anticoagulation
   .
   6. ? G tube leak-per OSH records though unclear where-no evidence of
   leaking around stoma, dressing dry.
   - check residuals, recs per IP
   .
   7. UTI-UA positive on admission despite records indicating treatment
   with linezolid and ceftriaxone(in med list on transfer ceftriaxone not
   recorded)  Patient was previously culture positive for E.facelis and
   E.coli
   -Follow cultures and adjust antibiotics accordingly
   -f/u sensitivities from OSH
   - Continue cipro
   .
   8. Anxiety and Depression-currently stabilized on current regimen
   follwed by psych  NP[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5283**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5284**]
   -Continue Klonopin, Cymbalta, Seroquel.
   .
   9. Seizures-patient denies having seizures as does daughter does not
   recall any episodes either . Documented in records from outside.
   Currently stable
   -Continue neurontin
   -Monitor neuro status
   .
   10. Anemia-3 point drop from yesterday, but no identifiable source of
   bleeding.
   -Follow HCT, check Fe, B12, folate
   -PM HCT tonight
   11. Hypothyroidism
   -Continue synthroid
   .
   12. CHF-last EF not documented in notes
   -Attempt to get outside records indicating degree of failure and adjust
   fluids as needed
   -Obtain ECHO, as CHF and fluid in lungs [**Known lastname **] contribute to difficulty
   weaning vent.
   .
   13. Sacral decubitus ulcer-currently stage II per nursing staff
   -continue to monitor
   -daily wound care
   FEN-Hold Nocturnal TF and regular thin liquid diet in setting of
   possible procedure

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Tracheostomy leak: The patient is ventilator dependent and has been transferred for an evaluation of tracheostomy leak. This could be due to tracheomegaly or malpositioning of the tube. A rigid bronchoscopy is planned to evaluate this further.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient reported worsening respiratory distress, and a chest X-ray showed evidence of left lung collapse. Other complicating factors include possible underlying neuromuscular disease, generalized weakness, history of congestive heart failure, and possible aspiration pneumonia. Bronchoscopy was performed for mucus removal, and aspiration precautions are being continued.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Possible organisms include MRSA, E. coli, and Enterococcus. Empiric coverage with vancomycin, Flagyl, and ciprofloxacin is being continued, and cultures are being followed.

4. COPD exacerbation: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and it is being treated with Fluticasone and albuterol.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation not currently requiring medication for rate control. Beta blockers may be started as needed.

6. G-tube leak: There is a suspicion of G-tube leak per"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known lastname 51], a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, is currently ventilator-dependent after undergoing tracheostomy replacement. The patient is experiencing tracheal leak, likely due to tracheomegaly, and has been treated with morphine for air hunger. There is also evidence of respiratory failure secondary to tracheal leak and pneumonia. Other possible contributing factors include underlying neuromuscular disease, generalized weakness, history of congestive heart failure (CHF), and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been started on Doripax/Ceftaz for resistant pseudomonas infection and has been placed on aspiration precautions. 

The patient's condition is stable but requires close monitoring. Additional concerns include stable COPD, atrial fibrillation/tachycardia, urinary tract infection (UTI), anxiety and depression, seizures, anemia, hypothyroidism, CHF, and sacral decubitus ulcer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal leak: The patient's tracheal leak is most likely related to tracheomegaly, making it difficult to manage air hunger. Continuous monitoring and treatment with morphine are necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to have respiratory discomfort secondary to tracheal leak and pneumonia. Bronchoscopic evaluation showed extensive mucus likely causing collapse. F/u CXR is positive for pseud"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple attempts at placing a central line due to coiling. The patient experienced episodes of low blood pressure that required fluid boluses. There were concerns about the potential interaction between Ceftazidime and Dilated, resulting in hypotension. Allergies include Midazolam, confusion, and delirium. The patient received various antibiotics and ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but there are signs of fluid overload. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate a potential medical complication. It is crucial to monitor and manage blood pressure to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to pneumonia and mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is at risk for developing a UTI due to indwelling catheters and immunosuppression from antibiotics. Regular urinalysis and urine culture should be performed to detect any infection early.
4. Leukocytosis:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 51**] is a 75F with COPD, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation who is
   ventilator dependent and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP evaluation of ?
   tracheostomy leak.
   1. Trach leak:  Most likely related to tracheomegaly, unclear reason.
   IP on board and replaced trach yesterday. .  .
   -Insert larger Trach, can also pack with saline soaked guaze, but did
   not want skin breakdown, so will hold off for now.
   -Treat air hunger with morphine PRN
   2. Respiratory failure:  The patient reported worsening respiratory
   distress today and overnight.  CXR this AM showed evidence of left lung
   collapse.  Other complicating factors [**Known lastname **] be possible underlying
   neuromuscular disease given generalized weakness, history of CHF and
   possible aspiration pneumonia per OSH records.
   -Bronch showed extensive mucus likely cause for collapse
   -F/u cx + for pseudomonas resistant to cipro
   -Started Doripax/Ceftaz Day 1=[**2201-1-26**]
   -Hold on diuretics as urine out put adequate
   -Continue aspiration precautions
   3. Leukocytosis:  Likely secondary to HAP by evidenced on CXR.
   Possible organisms are multiple given OSH records of MRSA, E coli, and
   Enterococcus, will attempt to get those records.  C diff unlikely,
   denies much beyond minimally loose stools.
   - Treat with double coverage for pseudomonas as above
   - Follow cultures
   - Follow fever curve and leukocytosis
   4. COPD-Stable
    -Continue Fluticasone and albuterol
   5. Atrial fibrillation/Tachycardia
 Currently in Sinus Tachycardia,
   possibly secondary to pneumonia, work of breathing.
   -
   6. ? G tube leak-per OSH records though unclear where-no evidence of
   leaking around stoma, dressing dry.
   - check residuals once tube feeding again
   7. UTI-UA positive on admission despite records indicating treatment
   with linezolid and ceftriaxone(in med list on transfer ceftriaxone not
   recorded)  Patient was previously culture positive for E.facelis and
   E.coli
   - D/C all abx except those above
   8. Anxiety and Depression-currently stabilized on current regimen
   follwed by psych  NP[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5283**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5284**]
   -Continue Klonopin, Cymbalta, Seroquel, with PRN Seroquel for anxiety
   9. Seizures- No patient/family record, only documented in OSH records.
   Will monitor. Currently stable
   -Monitor neuro status
   10. Anemia-3 point drop from yesterday, but no identifiable source of
   bleeding.
   -Follow HCT, check Fe, B12, folate
   11. Hypothyroidism
   -Continue synthroid
   12. CHF-last EF not documented in notes
   -Attempt to get outside records indicating degree of failure and adjust
   fluids as needed
   -Obtain ECHO, as CHF and fluid in lungs [**Known lastname **] contribute to difficulty
   weaning vent.
   13. Sacral decubitus ulcer-currently stage II per nursing staff
   -continue to monitor
   -daily wound care
   FEN-Hold Nocturnal TF and regular thin liquid diet in setting of
   possible procedure-restart today
   Access-2 PIV
   PPX-H2 blocker, pneumoboots, heparin SQ
   Dispo-ICU

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She is currently ventilator-dependent and admitted to the ICU for evaluation of tracheostomy leak. 

The patient's current issues include:

1. Trach leak: The patient has a history of tracheomegaly, which may be causing the leak. The trach has been replaced, but further interventions such as inserting a larger trach or packing with saline-soaked gauze may be considered to address the leak.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient reported worsening respiratory distress, and a chest X-ray showed evidence of left lung collapse. This collapse could be due to extensive mucus in the bronchus, which may be caused by aspiration pneumonia. The patient has already started on Doripax/Ceftaz, and additional precautions such as aspiration precautions are being taken.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia. Organisms such as MRSA, E. coli, and Enterococcus are possible, and cultures will be followed.

4. COPD: The patient's COPD is stable, and she will continue on Fluticasone and albuterol.

5. Atrial fibrillation/Tachycardia: The patient is currently in sinus tachycardia, possibly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. They have been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, pain management, and respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate within normal range and sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance is within acceptable limits, with an input of 3,434 mL and output of 3,065 mL over the past 24 hours. Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode. The patient's blood gases indicate adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to assessment not being performed in certain areas. Laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows improved aeration in the left lung on chest X-ray. The patient is on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and has multiple lines inserted for medical purposes. Prophylactic measures include anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

   bleeding.
   -Follow HCT, check Fe, B12, folate
   - Recheck Crit this afternoon
   8. Hypothyroidism
   -Continue synthroid
   9. CHF-last EF not documented in notes
   -Attempt to get outside records indicating degree of failure and adjust
   fluids as needed
   -Obtain ECHO, as CHF and fluid in lungs [**Known lastname **] contribute to difficulty
   weaning vent.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 51**] is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities. She is currently ventilator-dependent and admitted to the ICU after tracheostomy replacement. The patient has been experiencing respiratory discomfort due to tracheal leak and pneumonia. She also has generalized weakness, possible underlying neuromuscular disease, history of congestive heart failure (CHF), and aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal leak/Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: The patient continues to have respiratory discomfort secondary to tracheal leak and pneumonia.
2. Neuromuscular disease: Given the generalized weakness and possible underlying neuromuscular disease, this may contribute to respiratory failure.
3. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, which could worsen due to fluid in the lungs and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of CHF and possible aspiration pneumonia could lead to further respiratory complications.
5. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer, which needs monitoring and daily wound care.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient is currently being treated for hypothyroidism, and it should be monitored accordingly.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped significantly, and further investigation is needed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 51**] is a 75F with COPD, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation who is
   ventilator dependent s/p trach replacement by IP.
   1. Trach leak:  Most likely related to tracheomegaly, unclear reason.
   IP on board and replaced trach.
   -Treat air hunger with morphine PRN
   -Trial of pressure support, with follow up ABG
   2. Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have respiratory
   discomfort secondary to trach leak and pneumonia, . Other complicating
   factors [**Known lastname **] be possible underlying neuromuscular disease given
   generalized weakness, history of CHF and possible aspiration pneumonia
   per OSH records.
   -Bronch showed extensive mucus likely cause for collapse
   -F/u cx + for pseudomonas resistant to cipro
   -Started Doripax/Ceftaz Day 1=[**2201-1-26**]
   -Hold on diuretics as urine out put adequate
   -Continue aspiration precautions
   - Add Vancomycin for MRSA Coverage
   3. COPD-Stable
    -Continue Fluticasone and albuterol
   4. Atrial fibrillation/Tachycardia
 Currently in Sinus Tachycardia,
   possibly secondary to pneumonia, work of breathing.
   - Monitor throughout the day
   - Fentanyl patch 25mcg for pain control
   5. UTI-UA.
    - D/C all abx except those above
   6. Anxiety and Depression-currently stabilized on current regimen
   follwed by psych  NP[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5283**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5284**]
   -Continue Klonopin, Cymbalta, Seroquel, with PRN Seroquel for anxiety
   7. Seizures- No patient/family record, only documented in OSH records.
   Will monitor. Currently stable
   -Monitor neuro status
   8. Anemia-3 point drop from yesterday, but no identifiable source of
   bleeding.
   -Follow HCT, check Fe, B12, folate
   - Recheck Crit this afternoon
   9. Hypothyroidism
   -Continue synthroid
   10. CHF-last EF not documented in notes
   -Attempt to get outside records indicating degree of failure and adjust
   fluids as needed
   -Obtain ECHO, as CHF and fluid in lungs [**Known lastname **] contribute to difficulty
   weaning vent.
   11. Sacral decubitus ulcer-currently stage II per nursing staff
   -continue to monitor
   -daily wound care
   FEN- Restart TF after PICC line
   Access-2 PIV, PICC pending
   PPX-H2 blocker, pneumoboots, heparin SQ
   Dispo-ICU, Possible D/C to rehab today
   Code-Full, Confirmed as of [**1-25**]
   Comm-Daughter-[**Name (NI) 572**]-HCP-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 5285**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5286**], cell phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5296**]-very helpful for information.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation who is ventilator-dependent after tracheostomy replacement by IP.
- The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 26 to 22, suggesting hemolysis or bleeding, but no bleeding source has been identified.
- The patient's tracheostomy tube is leaking, which may be due to tracheomegaly.
- The patient continues to have respiratory discomfort and respiratory failure, likely secondary to tracheal leak and pneumonia.
- There are concerns about possible underlying neuromuscular disease given the generalized weakness, history of congestive heart failure, and potential aspiration pneumonia.
- Bronchoscopy showed extensive mucus likely causing collapse, and a follow-up chest X-ray revealed improved aeration of the left lung.
- The patient is being treated for suspected pseudomonas infection resistant to ciprofloxacin, and has been started on Doripax and Ceftazidime.
- Diuretics have been held due to adequate urine output, and aspiration precautions continue.
- Vancomycin has been added for MRSA coverage.
- The patient's COPD is currently stable, and she is to continue using fluticasone and albuterol.
- The patient is in sinus tachycardia, possibly secondary to pneumonia and work of breathing.
- The patient's urinary tract infection"
