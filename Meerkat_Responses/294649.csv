","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of progressive multiple sclerosis. The patient presents with weakness, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/60 mmHg to 70/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is around 55-60 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving fluids and vasopressor support with levophed due to hypotension. A central line was placed, resulting in an improvement in MAP and the patient's appearance. The patient's urine output is 50-225 cc/hr.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam at 05:28 AM on 07/08/2180 and Vancomycin at 06:11 AM on 07/08/2180.

The patient is currently on multiple infusions including phenylephrine at 1 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started at 01:00 AM on 07/08/2180. Other medications include unspecified ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and other parameters. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating between 38.5°C and 39.2°C. The blood cultures and urine cultures were negative. The CT chest/pelvis preliminary results indicate no large central PE, no abscess or focal fluid collection in the abdomen or pelvis, liver and renal hypodensities likely due to simple cysts, and an enlarged prostate. The CXR shows a central venous line in place.

The patient's lab results include WBC 18.1 K/uL, Hct 43.0%, Plt 301 K/uL, Cr 0.6 mg/dL, Glucose 115 mg/dL, and other labs within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include hypotension (not shock), fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), tachycardia, other, and impaired physical mobility. The patient meets the criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) based on respiratory rate, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. The potential infectious sources include sinusitis or influenza.

The plan includes following blood and urine cultures, continuing hydration with a goal MAP >65, monitoring urine output, viral"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who presented with weakness and tachycardia at home. He has been in the ICU for several days and is currently experiencing fever, hypotension, and unclear etiology. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, IV fluids, and pressor support. His vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, and low platelet count. The patient's condition remains unstable, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia raises concerns for sepsis. Given the unclear source of infection and the presence of multiple risk factors, it is important to closely monitor for signs of septic shock and promptly address any potential sources of infection.
2. MS exacerbation: As the patient has a history of MS, there is a possibility that his current symptoms may be related to an MS exacerbation. Close monitoring for neurological deficits and consideration of appropriate MS therapies may be necessary.
3. Metabolic causes: The patient's electrolyte imbalances and abnormal renal function tests suggest the possibility of metabolic derangements contributing to his symptoms. Further evaluation is required to identify and manage any metabolic causes.
4. Pulmonary complications:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of progressive multiple sclerosis who presented with weakness at home and tachycardia. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to fever but the source of sepsis remains unclear. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension and is being treated for septic shock. There is a possibility of basilar atelectasis or a small infiltrate causing the sepsis, and follow-up cultures are pending. Viral swab results are also expected. If the patient remains pressor dependent, consideration may be given to changing to levophed. Metabolic causes are also being investigated. The patient's multiple sclerosis medication has been discontinued and there is no recent history of immunosuppressants. Somnolence is present, but there is no current evidence of encephalitis. If the patient becomes confused or does not become more arouseable, a lumbar puncture may be considered. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers."

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of progressive multiple sclerosis who presented with weakness at home and a heart rate in the 140s. He was initially found to have a fever of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV fluids in the emergency department. He received ceftriaxone and 4 liters of normal saline. 

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient could not be placed on a ventilator and had difficulty maintaining his blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP). He required vasopressor support with phenylephrine at 1 mcg/kg/min. The patient's temperature was fluctuating, with a maximum recorded temperature of 39.2 degrees Celsius (102.5 degrees Fahrenheit) and a current temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.5 degrees Fahrenheit). 

His heart rate remained elevated, ranging from 104 to 133 beats per minute. His blood pressure was low, with readings as low as 95/58 mmHg. His respiratory rate was within normal limits at 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation was 96% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's weight had increased from 65.2 kg at admission to 73.9 kg currently. His CVP was measured at 2 mmHg this morning, down from 8 mmHg previously. The patient had received a total of 8,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with progressive myeloschisis (MS) who is currently in the ICU for septic shock of unclear etiology. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and shows signs of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and an increase in neutrophils. The source of the infection remains unclear, with possibilities including basilar atelectasis or a small infiltrate. The patient is pressor-dependent but urine output and lactate levels are normal. His central venous pressure (CVP) is low. The patient's somnolence may be due to MS rather than encephalitis. There are no current plans for encephalitis workup or lumbar puncture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly and effectively managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, which increases the risk of inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia.
3. Fever: The patient's fever indicates an ongoing inflammatory response, which could be a sign of persistent infection or sepsis.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be a compensatory response to maintain adequate circulation during hypotension.
5. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's impaired physical mobility may increase the risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   53 M w/ progressive MS, a/w septic shock, of unclear etiology.
    1. Septic Shock  -  Source remains unclear.  R basilar atelectasis vs
       small infiltrate is a possibility but not clear.  On broad spectrum
       antibiotics.  WBCC up, checking diff. Given fever, unlikely to be
       neurogenic.  Has only received 24h of antibiotics so this may not
       represent antibiotic failure.   Plan for sinus imaging but unless
       abscess visualized seems less likely as a possible etiology.  Viral
       swab is pending.
    2. Hypotension
 [**Month (only) 60**] not necessarily be related to sepsis as above
       given good mentation, Uo, and lactate normal.  Remains pressor
       dependent but despit  CVP now [**9-4**].  BP has increased on stable
       dose of pressor.  Will check BP at other sites- attempt to wean neo
       given discordant with clinical improvement.  If remains pressor
       dependent will change to levophed for Tx of septic shock.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) who presented with hypotension and was likely experiencing septic shock. The source of infection remains unclear, but he has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. He feels well and only reports ongoing sinus drainage as a symptom. His vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 99/53 mmHg to 64/43 mmHg, heart rate of 51 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is alert and oriented, with normal lung sounds and no other significant findings on physical examination. His laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, slightly elevated lactate levels, and normal glucose levels. He has been receiving vasopressor support and has shown some improvement in blood pressure. The assessment includes septic shock with an unclear source, hypotension that may not be related to sepsis, and MS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's ongoing fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. If the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly, there is a risk of worsening septic shock.
2. Hypotension: Despite being on vasopressor support, the patient's blood pressure remains low. If the hypotension does not improve"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with progressive multiple sclerosis who was admitted with hypotension likely secondary to septic shock. He reports ongoing sinus drainage but denies other symptoms. The patient's fever started on 07/09/2180 at 04:00 AM, and he has been receiving vasopressor support overnight. IV fluids have been given to maintain CVP at 10-12. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has no known drug allergies. He is also receiving medications for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's condition is currently stable, but there is a possibility of recurrence if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
2. Multiple Sclerosis (MS): MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. The patient may experience exacerbations or new neurological symptoms due to MS.
3. Sinusitis: The patient's ongoing sinus drainage could lead to complications such as abscess formation or meningitis if not properly managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient may continue to experience low blood pressure requiring vasopressor support.
5. Fever: The patient's fever indicates an ongoing inflammatory response and should be monitored closely to identify the underlying cause.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, which may be due to fever or se"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) who presented with hypotension and was likely experiencing septic shock. The source of sepsis remains unclear, with possible causes including basal atelectasis or a small lung infiltrate. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is also awaiting results from a viral swab.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/53 mmHg to 82/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no significant findings on physical examination except for sinus drainage.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 7 mg/dL, and normal kidney function. Other lab values, including hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal range or only slightly elevated.

   good UOP and mental status intact.  He met SIRS criteria on admission
   with RR, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. However his lactate was

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis who presented with weakness and fever. He has been diagnosed with hypotension, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 100/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is receiving various medications including doxycycline, piperacillin/tazobactam, and heparin sodium.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds diffusely with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. His cardiovascular examination is normal with regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2, and no murmurs or rubs. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and not distended with normal active bowel sounds. Extremities show 2+ radial and dorsal pedal pulses, which are warm and well perfused.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood cultures have been sent, and a CT scan of the sinuses shows mild mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus and mild narrowing of the left olfactory membrane. X-ray chest is clear. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, and glucose levels are within normal range"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis who presented with progressive weakness, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and monitoring.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is stable off pressors, and there is no evidence of sepsis as his lactate levels are within normal range. Other potential causes for his hypotension include infection, vasculitis, autoimmune disease, thyrotoxicosis, pancreatitis, osteomyelitis, prostatitis, endocarditis, or encephalitis. The patient's condition should be monitored, and further investigations should be done to identify the underlying cause.
2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient continues to have a low-grade fever. Since the CT sinus is negative, it is recommended to follow blood and urine cultures and continue with the current antibiotics until culture results are available. Doxycycline can be discontinued as the WBC count is decreasing.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is stable, and it is likely dilutional due to the administration of a large amount of fluid. Monitoring of the Hct level is recommended.
4. Multiple sclerosis: The patient is not currently on any medications for multiple sclerosis. He has been seen by"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who presented with sepsis of unclear etiology. The patient is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement since starting empirical antimicrobials. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/64 to 73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of abuse. The patient is well-nourished and has good spirits.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 50 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is within normal limits, while the blood glucose levels are slightly elevated.

The patient's medical history is significant for MS, but there is no recent history of immunosuppressive medications. The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for the current presentation of sepsis.

The patient's assessment and plan include continued empirical antimicrobials, monitoring for hypotension and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg, and close monitoring of the patient's clinical response to treatment. The source of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) who presented with sepsis of unclear etiology. The patient was treated with empirical antimicrobials and showed clinical improvement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which is low blood pressure. Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is crucial to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
3. Tachycardia: The patient had an elevated heart rate (tachycardia), which was attributed to hypovolemia. Close monitoring of the heart rate and maintaining adequate fluid balance is important.
4. MS exacerbation: As the patient has a history of MS, there is a risk of disease exacerbation due to inflammation or immune system response. Monitoring for neurological symptoms and providing appropriate MS-specific therapy may be necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic stable anemia, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition status should be assessed, and if needed, appropriate nutritional support should be provided.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU. Prophylaxis"
