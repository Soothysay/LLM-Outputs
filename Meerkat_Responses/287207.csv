   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 42 y.o male with no PMH who presented with
   SOB/fever/cough/weight loss/SOB and was found to have SVC syndrome and
   a mediastinal mass.
   .
   # mediastinal mass: Per onc, most likely this is carcinomatosis pattern
   of germ cell-teratoma given appearance on CT, elevated AFP in serum.
   Complicated by SVC syndrome and PE. There is concern for additionally
   affected locations given lesion in liver, however decision was made to
   start chemo urgently overnight.  Started etoposide, cisplatin day [**2-22**].
   Concern re: tumor lysis and/or worsening of SVC occlusion with onset of
   CTX so in ICU. Currently facial edema and SOB are improved, likely due
   to Decadron, with no signs of worsening SVC syndrome.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with no past medical history who presented with shortness of breath, fever, cough, weight loss, and shortness of breath. He was found to have superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and a mediastinal mass. The mediastinal mass is suspected to be a germ cell teratoma based on the appearance on CT scan and elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The patient also has pulmonary embolism (PE) and liver involvement. He received urgent chemotherapy overnight with etoposide and cisplatin. The patient's facial edema and shortness of breath have improved with dexamethasone (Decadron). 

Potential medical complications:
1. SVC syndrome: The mass is causing partial occlusion of the SVC, leading to facial edema and shortness of breath. Chemotherapy could cause further swelling and compression.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, which is being monitored with heparin.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to malignancy, infection, medication effect, or hepatic congestion. Further investigation with an MRI and hepatitis serologies is planned.
4. Anemia: The cause of anemia is unknown, but it could be related to malignancy. The patient's hemoglobin levels will be monitored while on heparin to ensure they are not actively bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), MEDIASTINAL MASS:  Pathology consistent
   with poorly differentiated germ cell tumor.  Testicular ultrasound to
   be done.
 SVC SYNDROME:  Plethora and neck vein distention improved.  Patient
   able to lie at an angle without SOB (previously sitting up in bed).
 CHEMOTHERAPY INITIATION:  Continue to monitor in ICU per oncology
   service to monitor for tumor lysis and worsening of SVC syndrome.
 LIVER ABNORMALITY:  MRI of liver for further evaluation.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Likely secondary to hypercoaguable state in
   setting of malignancy.
 POSTOBSTRUCTIVE PNEUMONIA:  Completing course of CTX/azithromycin.
   Minimal cough, never productive, no hemoptysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with SVC syndrome, initiation of chemotherapy, and multiple medical complications. They have a history of cancer with a poorly differentiated germ cell tumor consistent with pathology. The patient also has pulmonary embolism, liver abnormality, and postobstructive pneumonia. They are currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVC Syndrome: Superior vena cava syndrome is a potential complication caused by obstruction of the superior vena cava. It can lead to symptoms such as facial swelling, neck vein distention, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, it can compromise cerebral perfusion and result in neurological symptoms.

2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome is a group of metabolic complications that can occur after the initiation of chemotherapy, particularly in patients with high tumor burden or rapid tumor cell turnover. These complications include hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and renal failure.

3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has an incidental finding of pulmonary embolism on outside hospital CTA. This condition can lead to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and even circulatory collapse if left untreated.

4. Liver Abnormality: The patient's liver abnormality may indicate liver involvement by the malignancy or potential metastasis. Further evaluation through imaging studies, such as MRI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, cough, weight loss, and shortness of breath. He was found to have superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and a mediastinal mass. The patient has been diagnosed with cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, specifically a mediastinal mass. The differential diagnosis includes carcinomatosis pattern of germ cell-teratoma versus poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring due to concerns of tumor lysis and worsening SVC occlusion with the onset of chemotherapy. He has received cisplatin, etoposide, and dexamethasone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient is at risk for developing tumor lysis syndrome due to the initiation of chemotherapy. This condition occurs when cancer cells release their contents into the bloodstream, leading to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia. Close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and uric acid levels is necessary to prevent and manage this complication.

2. Worsening SVC Syndrome: Chemotherapy can cause further swelling and compression of the superior vena cava, leading to worsening SVC syndrome. The patient should be monitored clinically in the ICU for any signs of respiratory distress or worsening symptoms related to SVC"

The patient has several medical complications. Firstly, there is concern about tumor lysis and/or worsening of SVC occlusion with the onset of chemotherapy. Therefore, the patient is being monitored in the ICU. Intravenous fluids (IVF) have been ordered overnight per oncology. Follow-up pathology is also requested.

Secondly, the patient has SVC syndrome, which is caused by the mass with incomplete occlusion. The patient is on intravenous heparin and will be monitored clinically in the ICU as chemotherapy could cause further swelling and compression. Vascular intervention will be notified if there is clinical worsening.

Thirdly, the patient has a pulmonary embolus noted on outside hospital CT. He is continuing on heparin and oxygen is given as needed.

Fourthly, the patient has transaminitis, which could be due to malignancy, infection, or medication effect. It is also possible that hepatic congestion due to right heart failure effect is contributing to this condition. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with no previous medical history who presented with shortness of breath, fever, cough, weight loss, and was found to have superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and a mediastinal mass. He received two rounds of chemotherapy but experienced mid-line attempt failure, so peripheral intravenous (PIV) access was established instead.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/65 to 152/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals right-sided neck swelling, reduced breath sounds at the right side in both upper and lower air fields, clear lung auscultation on the left side, soft abdomen with no tenderness or distention, presence of collaterals along the chest wall, and no edema in the extremities.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count ranging from 9.4 to 10.5 thousand/mm3, hematocrit levels decreasing from 35.7% to 30.7%, platelet count ranging from 534 to 471 thousand/mm3, creatinine level consistently at 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 102 to 136 mg/dL, and elevated lactate"
