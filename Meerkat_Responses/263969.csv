   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 44 yo M with past history of IVDU, ESLD
   [**3-8**] Hep C/cirrhosis with recent open CCY complicated by VRE perihepatic
   fluid collection, admitted with lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain.
   Found to have persistent perihepatic fluid collection in setting of
   medication noncompliance and not taking linezolid. Now, he has profound
   metabolic/lactic acidosis
   .
   # Acidosis: This is mostly lactic acidosis with inadequate respiratory
   compensation based on Winter's. Lactic acidosis most likely source is
   intraabdominal infection given recent abd infections, drain, and pain
   on exam; however, no clear source has been identified.
   Bacteremia/sepsis less likely given negative blood cultures. UCx
   negative. TTE poor quality study, but no obvious vegetations. Of note,
   linezolid can also cause high lactate and may be a cause. CT shows C
   diff colitis and hepatic abscesses
   - discontinue bicarb today
   - Change propofol to versed and fentanyl bolus sedation as propofol can
   contribute to acidosis
   - Administer IV thiamine as beri beri can cause elevated lactate
   - Repeat ECHO as murmur is very prominent today to eval for interval
   change
   - change antibiotics to Daptomycin, IV flagyl, PO vancomycin and
   Meropenem
   - consider change linesozlid to daptomycin given thrombodytopenia and
   question of cause of lactate acidosis
   - trend lactate/ABG every 4 hours
   .
   # Altered Mental status: infection, hepatic enceph, uremia
   - on lactulose
   - will continue to address underlying causes
   .
   # Anemia/GIB. Baseline 27-30. No EGD reports in OMR, but per GI notes,
   EGD from [**2151**]8 did not show varices. Concern for GIB given sharp
   drop, eg. gastrophaty, vs. new varices. Patient with chronic anemia at
   baseline so hemolysis less concerning and most of bili is direct,
   however difficult to assess given liver failure. [**3-3**] AM has large
   volume lower GIB as noted in history.
   - transfuse HCT<25
   - Guiac all stools
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] for concerning bleed.
   - d/w GI for scope now that intubated
   - Q 4 hour HCT
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Liver dz vs meds (linezolid)
   - continue to trend
   - transfuse for plts<20 or bleeding
   .
   # elevated INR: may be from liver dz, DIC, received a total of 4 uPRBC,
   4 u FFP, cyroprecipate yesterday
   -Blood products as needed
   .
   # ARF. Cre 1.2 (baseline 0.8) Has been getting PRBCs and albumin today.
   Na < 10 in urine. Possibly pre-renal given suspected sepsis, but also
   pt. hyperdynamic on exam, and does not resond to fluids challenge, thus
   concern for hepatorenal. U/A unremarkable, has slight hydronephrosis on
   CT [**2-13**]. CT w/ mild hydronephrosis.
   - Monitor Cr daily.
   - continue midrodrine
   - Follow up on liver recs and consider octreotide
   - Will check urine lytes, then get 1 L bolus NS, followed by monitoring
   UOP and rechecking lytes
   - Consult renal regarding possible CVVH
   .
   # Hypercalcemia. etiology unclear, Alb normalized after infusions. Has
   no hx of hypercalcemia per labs in OMR. Pt. not on Vit D. DDx includes
   malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyproid. Pt. not on diuretics.
   - f/u PTH level
   - Free Ca level-trending down
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: holding home fursemide and atenolol in setting of
   infection, may restart when improves. MELD 35 today, on transplant
   list.
   - holding home cholestyramine for itching.
   - restart lactulose and rifaximin when able
   - Continue midodrine
   .
   # Hypernatremia: suspect hypovolemic hypernatremia due to insensible
   losses from infection. Also, he has been receiving albumin which is
   high Na load
   -          will monitor and when more stable would address free water
   replacement as above
   -          continue q 8 hour lytes
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: cont home levothyroxine
   - check TSH
   .
   # Hx Heroine use: cont home methadone, hold home oxycodone in setting
   of encephalopathy
   - hold methadone for now
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, consider TPN in AM
   - IVF bolus as above
   .
   # Access: PIV, RIJ, A-line
   .
   # PPx: None
   .
   # Code: FULL

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who presented with lethargy, jaundice, and abdominal pain. He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, hepatic abscesses, and has undergone an open cholecystectomy complicated by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) perihepatic fluid collection. The patient is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 106/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, HCO3- of 16 mEq/L, and base excess of -10. The patient's lactic acid level is elevated at 13.8 mmol/L.

The patient has multiple medical complications including profound metabolic/lactic acidosis, altered mental status (likely due to infection, hepatic encephalopathy, and uremia), anemia/gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), thrombocytopenia (possibly due to liver disease or medication), elevated INR (possibly due to liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation ("

The patient's condition is concerning for Clostridium difficile infection (c diff) as indicated by the pancolitis seen on the CT abdomen. Additionally, there are small hypodensities in the liver suggesting abscesses, and bibasilar atelectasis.

The patient's vital signs show a decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) from 30 to 26.7, which has been rechecked and increased to 27. There is also a decrease in urine output (UOP), for which a 500cc normal saline (NS) bolus has been given.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (invasive ventilation) and has arterial, trauma, and central venous lines placed. Blood cultures were taken at 08:00 AM, wound culture at 03:59 PM, and a joint puncture (JP) drain fluid was also obtained.

The patient's medications include daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), pantoprazole (Protonix), and propofol for sedation.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 53 K/uL, hyponatremia with sodium levels of "

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 44 yo M with past history of IVDU, ESLD
   [**3-8**] Hep C/cirrhosis with recent open CCY complicated by VRE perihepatic
   fluid collection, admitted with lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain.
   Found to have persistent perihepatic fluid collection in setting of
   medication noncompliance and not taking linezolid. Now, he has profound
   metabolic/lactic acidosis
   .
   # Acidosis: This is mostly lactic acidosis with inadequate respiratory
   compensation based on Winter's. Lactic acidosis most likely source is
   intraabdominal infection given recent abd infections, drain, and pain
   on exam; however, no clear source has been identified.
   Bacteremia/sepsis less likely given negative blood cultures. UCx
   negative. TTE poor quality study, but no obvious vegetations. Of note,
   linezolid can also cause high lactate and may be a cause.
   - receiving bicarb for acidosis and will continue for CT prehydration
   - needs KUB to assess for free air, would need CT abd IV/PO contrast
   - continue zosyn and add flagyl to cover for bacteroides
   - consider change linesozlid to daptomycin given thrombodytopenia and
   question of cause of lactate acidosis
   - trend lactate/ABG
   .
   # Altered Mental status: infection, hepatic enceph, uremia
   - will need to intubate for airway protection given MS and concern for
   airway protection
   - will continue to address underlying causes
   .
   # Anemia/GIB. Baseline 27-30. No EGD reports in OMR, but per GI notes,
   EGD from [**2151**]8 did not show varices. Concern for GIB given sharp
   drop, eg. gastrophaty, vs. new varices. Patient with chronic anemia at
   baseline so hemolysis less concerning and most of bili is direct,
   however difficult to assess given liver failure. [**3-3**] AM has large
   volume lower GIB as noted in history.
   - transfuse HCT<25
   - Guiac all stools
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] for concerning bleed.
   - d/w GI for scope now that intubated
   - needs CT
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Liver dz vs meds (linezolid)
   - change linezolid to daptomycin
   - transfuse for plts<20 or bleeding
   .
   # elevated INR: may be from liver dz, DIC
   - check DIC labs
   - hemolysis labs
   - 2UFFP for now prior to procedures
   .
   # ARF. Cre 1.2 (baseline 0.8) Has been getting PRBCs and albumin today.
   Na < 10 in urine. Possibly pre-renal given suspected sepsis, but also
   pt. hyperdynamic on exam, and does not resond to fluids challenge, thus
   concern for hepatorenal. U/A unremarkable, has slight hydronephrosis on
   CT [**2-13**]. CT w/ mild hydronephrosis.
   - Monitor Cr daily.
   - stop albumin now and d/w liver re: octreotide and midodrine
   .
   # Hypercalcemia. etiology unclear, Alb normalized after infusions. Has
   no hx of hypercalcemia per labs in OMR. Pt. not on Vit D. DDx includes
   malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyproid. Pt. not on diuretics.
   - f/u PTH level
   - monitor Free Ca level
   - trending down and continue to monitor
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: holding home fursemide and atenolol in setting of
   infection, may restart when improves. MELD 35 today, on transplant
   list.
   - holding home cholestyramine for itching.
   - restart lactulose and rifaximin when able
   - Continue midodrine
   .
   # Hypernatremia: suspect hypovolemic hypernatremia due to insensible
   losses from infection. Also, he has been receiving albumin which is
   high Na load
   - will monitor and when more stable would address free water
   replacement as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: cont home levothyroxine
   - check TSH
   .
   # Hx Heroine use: cont home methadone, hold home oxycodone in setting
   of encephalopathy
   - hold methadone for now
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU), end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and Hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presented with lethargy, jaundice, and abdominal pain. The patient has multiple medical complications including profound metabolic/lactic acidosis, altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, and a history of heroin use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic/Lactic Acidosis: The patient has a profound metabolic/lactic acidosis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. It is important to continue bicarbonate infusion and address the underlying cause.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to infection, hepatic encephalopathy, or uremia. Airway protection is necessary, and underlying causes need to be addressed.

3. Anemia/Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a drop in hemoglobin levels, indicating anemia. There is concern for gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from new varices or gastritis. Further evaluation is needed with endoscopy, and transfusion may be required.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely due to liver disease or medication (linezolid). Linezolid should be changed to daptomycin, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   44-year-old man with
          Profound lactic acidosis
          Acute renal failure
          Respiratory failure
          Acute-on-chronic liver failure
          GI bleed
          Cardiac murmur
          Hypernatremia, hypercalcemia
   For acidosis: add thiamine.  Doesn
t appear to be markedly hypoperfused
   at present, so suspect that some of this is poor clearance and possibly
   mitochondrial issues.  Hold bicarb since no outcome evidence favors
   this at this point, but follow q4h pHs.  Swap propofol to other
   sedatives, though doubt propofol infusion syndrome.
   Current ABX per ID:  meropenem, oral vanco, oral Flagyl, rifaxamin,
   daptomycin.  Discuss with ID about potential coverage for VAP and wait
   for gram stain/culture.  If any GPCs on sputum
 add IV vanco.
   For acute renal failure:  check urine lytes.  Bladder pressure is 17.
   CT from yesterday does not show hydro.  Discuss octreotide/midodrine
   with liver.  Volume challenge with pre/post urine lytes.  Renal consult
   if unclear.
   For murmur: repeat echo today.  Avoid TEE because of varices.
   For respiratory failure:  leave intubated while other issues ongoing.
   For GI bleed: discuss with GI regarding utility of endoscopy.  For now,
   serial Hcts, clinical observations, etc.
   For hypernatremia:  volume challenge since he may be dry.  If unclear,
   further evaluation
   Discussed with patient
s wife at bedside.  All questions answered.
   Other issues per ICU team note.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU for various medical complications. The patient underwent surgery and experienced hypotension, leading to the initiation of vasopressor therapy. They also have acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia, which have been managed accordingly. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension despite increased vasopressor requirements and persistent acidosis. The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, metronidazole, vancomycin, and linezolid. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Septic shock: The presence of multiple antibiotics suggests an ongoing infection, and the patient's hemodynamic instability may indicate septic shock.
2. Organ failure: The patient's acidosis and low urine output suggest possible organ failure, such as renal or hepatic dysfunction.
3. Bleeding: The patient experienced bleeding from the mouth, nose, and bloody stool, indicating a possible bleeding disorder or coagulopathy.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's persistently low blood sugar levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need to be corrected to avoid neurological complications.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
7. Deep vein thrombosis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 yo M with past history of IVDU, ESLD [**3-8**] Hep C/cirrhosis
   with recent open CCY complicated by VRE perihepatic fluid collection,
   admitted with lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. Found to have
   persistent perihepatic fluid collection in setting of medication
   noncompliance and not taking linezolid. Now, he has profound
   metabolic/lactic acidosis
   # Acidosis: This is mostly lactic acidosis with inadequate respiratory
   compensation based on Winter's. Lactic acidosis most likely source is
   intraabdominal infection given recent abd infections, drain, and pain
   on exam; however, no clear source has been identified.
   Bacteremia/sepsis less likely given negative blood cultures. UCx
   negative. TTE poor quality study, but no obvious vegetations. Of note,
   linezolid can also cause high lactate and may be a cause. CT shows C
   diff colitis and hepatic abscesses
   - discontinue bicarb today
   - Change propofol to versed and fentanyl bolus sedation as propofol can
   contribute to acidosis
   - Administer IV thiamine as beri beri can cause elevated lactate
   - Repeat ECHO as murmur is very prominent today to eval for interval
   change
   - change antibiotics to Daptomycin, IV flagyl, PO vancomycin and
   Meropenem
   - consider change linesozlid to daptomycin given thrombodytopenia and
   question of cause of lactate acidosis
   - trend lactate/ABG every 4 hours
   # Altered Mental status: infection, hepatic enceph, uremia
   - on lactulose
   - will continue to address underlying causes
   # Anemia/GIB. Baseline 27-30. No EGD reports in OMR, but per GI notes,
   EGD from [**2151**]8 did not show varices. Concern for GIB given sharp
   drop, eg. gastrophaty, vs. new varices. Patient with chronic anemia at
   baseline so hemolysis less concerning and most of bili is direct,
   however difficult to assess given liver failure. [**3-3**] AM has large
   volume lower GIB as noted in history.
   - transfuse HCT<25
   - Guiac all stools
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] for concerning bleed.
   - d/w GI for scope now that intubated
   - Q 4 hour HCT
   # Thrombocytopenia: Liver dz vs meds (linezolid)
   - continue to trend
   - transfuse for plts<20 or bleeding
   # elevated INR: may be from liver dz, DIC, received a total of 4 uPRBC,
   4 u FFP, cyroprecipate yesterday
   -Blood products as needed
   # ARF. Cre 1.2 (baseline 0.8) Has been getting PRBCs and albumin today.
   Na < 10 in urine. Possibly pre-renal given suspected sepsis, but also
   pt. hyperdynamic on exam, and does not resond to fluids challenge, thus
   concern for hepatorenal. U/A unremarkable, has slight hydronephrosis on
   CT [**2-13**]. CT w/ mild hydronephrosis.
   - Monitor Cr daily.
   - continue midrodrine
   - Follow up on liver recs and consider octreotide
   - Will check urine lytes, then get 1 L bolus NS, followed by monitoring
   UOP and rechecking lytes
   - Consult renal regarding possible CVVH
   # Hypercalcemia. etiology unclear, Alb normalized after infusions. Has
   no hx of hypercalcemia per labs in OMR. Pt. not on Vit D. DDx includes
   malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyproid. Pt. not on diuretics.
   - f/u PTH level
   - Free Ca level-trending down
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: holding home fursemide and atenolol in setting of
   infection, may restart when improves. MELD 35 today, on transplant
   list.
   - holding home cholestyramine for itching.
   - restart lactulose and rifaximin when able
   - Continue midodrine
   # Hypernatremia: suspect hypovolemic hypernatremia due to insensible
   losses from infection. Also, he has been receiving albumin which is
   high Na load
   -          will monitor and when more stable would address free water
   replacement as above
   -          continue q 8 hour lytes
   # Hypothyroidism: cont home levothyroxine
   - check TSH
   # Hx Heroine use: cont home methadone, hold home oxycodone in setting
   of encephalopathy
   - hold methadone for now
   # FEN: NPO for now, consider TPN in AM
   - IVF bolus as above
   # Access: PIV, RIJ, A-line
   # PPx: None
   # Code: FULL , Family meeting today
   # Dispo: pending clinical improvement
   # Comm: With patient and wife.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use, ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to Hepatitis C cirrhosis, and recent open CCY complicated by VRE (Vancomycin-resistant enterococci) perihepatic fluid collection. He presented with lethargy, jaundice, and abdominal pain. The patient has been diagnosed with persistent perihepatic fluid collection, profound metabolic/lactic acidosis, and hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Acidosis: Most likely caused by lactic acidosis due to intra-abdominal infection, with inadequate respiratory compensation.
- Altered mental status: Possible causes include infection, hepatic encephalopathy, and uremia.
- Anemia/GIB (Gastrointestinal Bleeding): Sharp drop in hemoglobin, concern for GI bleed or new varices. Hemolysis less concerning due to chronic anemia.
- Thrombocytopenia: May be due to liver disease or medication (linezolid).
- Elevated INR: May be from liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or blood product transfusion.
- ARF (Acute Renal Failure): Possible pre-renal azotemia due to sepsis, concern for hepatorenal syndrome. Kidney function is deteriorating.
- Hypercalcemia: Etiology unclear, considering malignancy, hyper"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 yo M with past history of IVDU, ESLD [**3-8**] Hep C/cirrhosis
   with recent open CCY complicated by VRE perihepatic fluid collection,
   admitted with lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. Found to have
   persistent perihepatic fluid collection in setting of medication
   noncompliance and not taking linezolid. Now, he has profound
   metabolic/lactic acidosis.
   A family meeting was held today in which the patient was made DNR/DNrI
   and ultimately CMO once his family could all make it in and say their
   goodbyes.
   # Acidosis: This is mostly lactic acidosis with inadequate respiratory
   compensation based on Winter's. Lactic acidosis most likely source is
   intraabdominal infection given recent abd infections, drain, and pain
   on exam; however, no clear source has been identified.
   Bacteremia/sepsis less likely given negative blood cultures. UCx
   negative. TTE poor quality study, but no obvious vegetations. Of note,
   linezolid can also cause high lactate and may be a cause. CT shows C
   diff colitis and hepatic abscesses
   - discontinue bicarb today
   - Change propofol to versed and fentanyl bolus sedation as propofol can
   contribute to acidosis
   - Administer IV thiamine as beri beri can cause elevated lactate
   - Repeat ECHO as murmur is very prominent today to eval for interval
   change
   - change antibiotics to Daptomycin, IV flagyl, PO vancomycin and
   Meropenem
   - consider change linesozlid to daptomycin given thrombodytopenia and
   question of cause of lactate acidosis
   - trend lactate/ABG every 4 hours
   # Altered Mental status: infection, hepatic enceph, uremia
   - on lactulose
   - will continue to address underlying causes
   # Anemia/GIB. Baseline 27-30. No EGD reports in OMR, but per GI notes,
   EGD from [**2151**]8 did not show varices. Concern for GIB given sharp
   drop, eg. gastrophaty, vs. new varices. Patient with chronic anemia at
   baseline so hemolysis less concerning and most of bili is direct,
   however difficult to assess given liver failure. [**3-3**] AM has large
   volume lower GIB as noted in history.
   - transfuse HCT<25
   - Guiac all stools
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] for concerning bleed.
   - d/w GI for scope now that intubated
   - Q 4 hour HCT
   # Thrombocytopenia: Liver dz vs meds (linezolid)
   - continue to trend
   - transfuse for plts<20 or bleeding
   # elevated INR: may be from liver dz, DIC, received a total of 4 uPRBC,
   4 u FFP, cyroprecipate yesterday
   -Blood products as needed
   # ARF. Cre 1.2 (baseline 0.8) Has been getting PRBCs and albumin today.
   Na < 10 in urine. Possibly pre-renal given suspected sepsis, but also
   pt. hyperdynamic on exam, and does not resond to fluids challenge, thus
   concern for hepatorenal. U/A unremarkable, has slight hydronephrosis on
   CT [**2-13**]. CT w/ mild hydronephrosis.
   - Monitor Cr daily.
   - continue midrodrine
   - Follow up on liver recs and consider octreotide
   - Will check urine lytes, then get 1 L bolus NS, followed by monitoring
   UOP and rechecking lytes
   - Consult renal regarding possible CVVH
   # Hypercalcemia. etiology unclear, Alb normalized after infusions. Has
   no hx of hypercalcemia per labs in OMR. Pt. not on Vit D. DDx includes
   malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyproid. Pt. not on diuretics.
   - f/u PTH level
   - Free Ca level-trending down
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: holding home fursemide and atenolol in setting of
   infection, may restart when improves. MELD 35 today, on transplant
   list.
   - holding home cholestyramine for itching.
   - restart lactulose and rifaximin when able
   - Continue midodrine
   # Hypernatremia: suspect hypovolemic hypernatremia due to insensible
   losses from infection. Also, he has been receiving albumin which is
   high Na load
   -          will monitor and when more stable would address free water
   replacement as above
   -          continue q 8 hour lytes
   # Hypothyroidism: cont home levothyroxine
   - check TSH
   # Hx Heroine use: cont home methadone, hold home oxycodone in setting
   of encephalopathy
   - hold methadone for now
   # FEN: NPO for now, consider TPN in AM
   - IVF bolus as above
   # Access: PIV, RIJ, A-line
   # PPx: None
   # Code: DNR/DNrI, CMO per Family meeting today
   # Dispo: pending clinical improvement
   # Comm: With patient and wife.
