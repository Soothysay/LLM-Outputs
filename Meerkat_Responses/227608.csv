   Imaging: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2181-2-28**] 12:55 PM
   SINGLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Allowing for low lung volumes,
   there is mild crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. There is haziness
   and
   indistinctness of the left heart border which may be related to
   overlying soft
   tissues or crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, but infiltrate cannot
   be
   excluded. Linear opacity in the right lower lobe is stable and likely
   related
   to atelectasis.
   The heart size is stable. There is slight unfolding of the thoracic
   aorta.
   Hilar contours are unremarkable. There is a double- lumen dialysis
   catheter
   projecting over the right atrium. There has been interval resolution of
   the
   previously identified pneumoperitoneum. An IVC filter is again noted
   projecting in the right upper abdomen. A G-tube is also again
   identified in the left upper abdomen.
   IMPRESSION: Indistinctness of the left heart border which may be
   related to
   overlying soft tissue, but infection is not excluded.

   pneumonia.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to infection, and new infiltrate on
   chest xray and leukocytosis are concerning for pneumonia with early
   sepsis. Another source of the pt's leukocytosis may be the gangrenous
   right foot and indwelling HD line
   - Follow up blood cultures, sputum cultures
   - Continue broad spectrum abx (Vanc, Zosyn) pending cultures.
   - Appreciate vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Maintain MAP above 60 with IVF and vasopressin. Responds to small
   amounts of IVF so no need for CVL placement at this time.
   - Monitor U/O
   .
   # Elevation in troponin: Troponin T is currently at recent baseline
   (0.26-0.37). Chronically elevated troponins likely secondary to chronic
   renal failure. No chest pain, no change on EKG.
   - Check second trop to make sure trending down
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: On recent discharge creatinine was 2.8, but
   had ranged from 1.8 to 3.5. Pt is likely at baseline creatinine.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and right lower extremity dry gangrene. He presented to the clinic with hypotension and pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/63 mmHg (74/33-130/72 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving vasopressin at a rate of 2.4 units per hour.

Physical examination findings include indistinctness of the left heart border on chest X-ray, which may be related to overlying soft tissues or crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, but infection cannot be excluded. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination were not assessed.

Laboratory results show a troponin T level of 0.24, with other labs indicating a PT/PTT/INR of 14.7/30.1/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T at 65/4/0.24. Imaging reveals mild crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, haziness and indistinctness of the left heart border, linear opacity in the right lower lobe, and resolution of a previously identified pneumoperitoneum.

The patient has several medical complications and potential sources of infection, including pneumonia with early sepsis, dry gangrene in the right lower extremity, indwelling hemodialysis line, and potential urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's elevated troponin level may be secondary to chronic renal failure, and there is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome.

The assessment and plan include renal failure, dyspnea, gangrene, and hypotension. The patient should be monitored for sepsis, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued. Blood cultures and sputum cultures should be obtained, and fluid resuscitation should be maintained to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

In summary, the patient's medical complications and potential sources of infection include pneumonia with early sepsis, dry gangrene, indwelling HD line, and potential UTI. The patient's elevated troponin level may be secondary to chronic renal failure. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to address these complications and potential infections."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a complex medical history including prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), right lower extremity dry gangrene, and pneumonia. He presented to the clinic with hypotension and a new infiltrate on chest x-ray, leading to his current admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and a new infiltrate on chest x-ray, suggesting pneumonia as the cause of his hypotension. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but further surveillance blood cultures and sputum cultures are needed to guide treatment.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to infection and volume taken off from dialysis. He is currently on levophed and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure. MAP > 60 should be maintained, and IV fluids should be given as needed. Urine output should also be closely monitored.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has decreased from 28.3% to 24.8%, which may be due to hemodilution during dialysis or chronic kidney disease. Further monitoring is recommended, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) should be ruled out.

4. Chronic Renal Failure:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (HD), and right lower extremity dry gangrene. He presented to the clinic with hypotension and pneumonia. 

The patient's current medical complications include hypotension likely secondary to infection and pneumonia, elevation in troponin levels possibly due to chronic renal failure, chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.8-3.5, peripheral vascular disease requiring amputation of the right lower extremity (RAKA), previous subdural hematoma, glaucoma, and pain control issues. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include septic shock from untreated pneumonia, further worsening of renal function, cardiac complications due to chronic kidney disease, non-healing of the gangrenous foot leading to potential amputation, and the risk of clot formation due to immobility and indwelling lines. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and response to treatment. Additionally, appropriate cultures should be obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued pending results. The patient's troponin levels should be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Renal function should be closely monitored, and plans for dialysis should be followed. Pain management and appropriate wound care"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently undergoing hemodialysis. There is also evidence of gangrene in the toes, which is likely related to a bloodstream infection caused by coag-negative staphylococcus bacteria. The source of the infection appears to be from a central venous line. The patient is being treated with a 14-day course of antibiotics to address the infection.

The patient's hypotension is suspected to be related to sepsis, and efforts are being made to wean off vasopressin. Additionally, the patient has eosinophilia, which may be due to medication use, adrenal failure, or other conditions such as hypersensitivity enteritis or Churg-Strauss syndrome. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 95%. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,872 mL and output of 1,555 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 317 mL. Laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and potassium levels, along with decreased hemoglobin and platelet count.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of gangrene in the toes and abnormal breath sounds in the chest. Neurologic assessment was not performed, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and a history of hemodialysis.

2. Gangrene: The patient has gangrenous toes, which indicates compromised blood flow to the extremities and potential tissue death.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely related to sepsis. Vasopressin is being used to maintain blood pressure.

4. Blood Infection: Blood cultures have come back positive, suggesting a bacterial infection. An antibiotic course has been initiated to treat this.

5. Possible Line Infection: Coag-negative staphylococcus has been identified, which may indicate a line infection. Antibiotics have been prescribed, and cultures will be followed.

6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TFs) due to malnutrition concerns.

7. Eosinophilia: The patient has an elevated eosinophil count, which can be caused by various factors such as medication reactions, infections, adrenal failure, or autoimmune conditions.

8. Adrenal Failure: There is a concern for adrenal failure, which may require specific management.

9. Other conditions: The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease, stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prophylaxis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, and deep vein thrombosis who presented to the clinic with hypotension and pneumonia. He has been recently discharged from the intensive care unit and is currently in the hospital.

24-hour events include the administration of vasopressin via peripheral intravenous (PIV), hemodialysis (HD), and inability to discontinue vasopressin due to HD. The patient's allergies are to NSAIDs and sulfa antibiotics.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/58 mmHg to 145/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,167 mL, including 750 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 662 mL through intravenous fluids, and 375 mL of blood products. There is no output recorded.

Physical examination reveals an elderly man in decorticate posturing but moving upper extremities. His HEENT exam is normal, lungs are clear, and heart sounds are regular with no murmurs. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the extremities show cool feet with right foot gangrene and left lower extremity swelling with +2 edema.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and right lower extremity dry gangrene. He was recently discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently presenting from the clinic with hypotension and pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 98/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving vasopressin and levophed for blood pressure support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be indicative of a line infection. Surveillance blood cultures have been ordered, and vancomycin has been initiated for presumed line infection due to growth of coag-negative staphylococcus in the blood.
2. Eosinophilia: The patient has eosinophilia with an unclear etiology. Further investigation is needed, and the peripheral differential will be rechecked tomorrow.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to infection and due to volume taken off from dialysis. The patient is currently on levophed and vasopressin. MAP > 60 is the target.
4. Chronic renal failure: The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and right lower extremity dry gangrene. He was recently discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) and is now presenting with hypotension and pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be indicative of a line infection. Vanc has been prescribed for a presumed line infection, as blood cultures are growing coag-negative Staphylococcus. It is important to continue surveillance blood cultures and treat the infection with Vanc for a two-week course.
2. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophil count is elevated, but the etiology is unclear. O+P pending, and it is planned to recheck the peripheral diff tomorrow.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to infection and due to volume taken off from dialysis. Off vasopressin yesterday, back on this morning during HD. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
4. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and it is important to continue with regular hemodialysis per renal recommendations. Follow-up renal records should be maintained.
5. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD)/Gangrene: The patient"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and right lower extremity dry gangrene. He presented from the clinic with hypotension and pneumonia.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly a line infection or pneumonia. This should be monitored and treated appropriately.

2. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophil count is high, but the cause is unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the etiology of the eosinophilia.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be secondary to infection and fluid removal during dialysis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and volume status is necessary.

4. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and requires ongoing management with hemodialysis. Renal function should be closely monitored.

5. Dyspnea: The patient has shortness of breath, which may be related to his underlying chronic kidney disease or a respiratory infection.

6. Gangrene: The patient has dry gangrene in the right lower extremity, and plans for amputation (AKA) should be made in consultation with vascular surgery.

   further management of arrhythmia.
   Tachycardia
   Now resolved and has first degree AV block. Etiology of his tachycardia
   is unclear. One of his ECGs appears consistent with AVNRT with
   retrograde P waves; however, other ECGs appear more consistent with
   atrial tachycardia. Pt s/p adenosine in HD when this started. Patient's
   tachycardia may have been related to the vasopressin he received and/or
   electrolyte abnormalities in the setting of HD.
   - discontinue amiodarone since no clear indication
   - daily ECG, telemetry
   Hypotension
   Etiology of his hypotension is unclear. Sepsis is possible, patient has
   1 positive blood culture for coag negative staph. Additional
   possibility includes a line infection or super infection of her right
   lower extremity wound. hypovolemia in the setting of hemodialysis also
   possible. No echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
   - follow-up blood and stool cultures
   - resend sputum sample if able
   - consider repeat echocardiogram
   Coag negative staph bacteremia:
 bottles positive. Considering line infection, but it is likely a
   contaminant. Will keep HD line in for now, since it is a new line, and

   - continue vancomycin to complete a 14 day course for presumed line
   infection ([**Date range (1) 6463**])
   Left arm swelling: left UE ultrasound
   Rash: possibly related to zosyn that he was on in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].
   Congestive heart failure: EF 50%
   Patient euvolemic, possibly intravascularly dry given hypotension.
   - continue to maintain fluid status with hemodialysis
   CAD
   Patient has no specific history of CAD, although has likely presumed
   CAD in the setting of marked peripheral vascular disease.
   - continue aspirin and statin
   ESRD
   Patient has ESRD for unclear reasons.

   Seizures
   Patient has had seizures thought likely related to subarachnoid
   hemorrhage in the setting of heparin drip.

   Chronic Pain
   Patient has pain likely related to his right foot. He appears in
   moderate control of his pain.
   - continue percocet and fentanyl patch

    Eosinophilia
   Patient has elevated peripheral eosinophils for unclear reasons.
   Etiology is unclear but most likely related to medication effect.
   - continue to trend
   - follow-up strongyloides antibody
   - consider discontinuing vancomycin if no clear indication and if

   and right lower extremity gangrene was transferred to the CCU for
   further management of arrhythmia.
   .
   1. Tachycardia
   Etiology of his tachycardia is unclear. One of his ECGs appears
   consistent with AVNRT with retrograde P waves; however, other ECGs
   appear more consistent with atrial tachycardia. Patient currently is in
   sinus rhythm. Patient's tachycardia may have been related to the
   vasopressin he received and/or electrolyte abnormalities in the setting
   of HD.

   no clear indication
   - ECG in the AM
   - continue ICU monitoring on telemetry

   2. Hypotension
   Etiology of his hypotension is unclear. Sepsis is possible, although
   there are no clear sources for infection. Blood and stool cultures are
   still pending. Sputum culture was a poor sample. Additional possibility
   includes a line infection or super infection of her right lower
   extremity wound. Additional possibility includes hypovolemia in the
   setting of hemodialysis. No echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
   - follow-up blood and stool cultures
   - will pull line if blood culture from HD line is positive
   - resend sputum sample if able
   - encourage PO intake
   - continue vancomycin to complete a 14 day course for presumed line
   infection ([**Date range (1) 6463**])
   - consider repeat echocardiogram

   3. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] localizing source of
   infection.
   - continue to follow-up cultures
   .
   4. CAD
   Patient has no specific history of CAD, although has likely presumed
   CAD in the setting of marked peripheral vascular disease.
   - continue aspirin and statin
   .
   5. Congestive heart failure
   Patient appears overloaded given elevated JVP and increased lower
   extremity edema.
   - continue to maintain fluid status with hemodialysis

   8. Seizures
   Patient has had seizures thought likely related to subarachnoid
   hemorrhage in the setting of heparin drip.
   - continue keppra

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with multiple medical problems including bladder cancer, hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), subdural hematoma (SDH), and right lower extremity gangrene. He was transferred to the CCU for further management of arrhythmia. The patient's tachycardia has resolved, but the etiology is unclear. He is now experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, line infection, or hypovolemia. The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococci, suggesting a possible line infection. His left arm is swollen, but a recent ultrasound did not show any evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient has a rash, possibly related to Zosyn. He has congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50%. The patient also has chronic kidney disease, right lower extremity dry gangrene, seizures, chronic pain, glaucoma, and eosinophilia.

1. Arrhythmia: The patient's tachycardia and first-degree AV block need to be monitored closely. Further evaluation is required to determine the underlying cause.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococci suggest the possibility of sepsis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and pain management. He is currently on various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lansoprazole (Prevacid), and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient has undergone several procedures such as gastrostomy tube placement, IVC filter placement, right PICC line insertion, and hemodialysis catheter insertion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
2. Pain control: The patient requires effective pain management for both acute and chronic pain.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, which could indicate underlying stress or potential cardiac issues.
4. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and there is a concern for worsening kidney function.
5. Dyspnea: The patient may experience difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, possibly due to pulmonary complications or fluid overload.
6. Gangrene: The patient's peripheral vascular disease increases the risk of gangrene formation, especially if blood flow to the extremities is compromised.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating potential low blood pressure or orthost"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:
   86yo male with multiple medical problems including bladder cancer s/p
   removal, hypertension, ESRD on HD, DVT, SDH while on anticoagulation,
   and right lower extremity gangrene was transferred to the CCU for
   further management of arrhythmia.
   Tachycardia
   Now resolved and has first degree AV block. Etiology of his tachycardia
   is unclear. One of his ECGs appears consistent with AVNRT with
   retrograde P waves; however, other ECGs appear more consistent with
   atrial tachycardia. Pt s/p adenosine in HD when this started. Patient's
   tachycardia may have been related to the vasopressin he received and/or
   electrolyte abnormalities in the setting of HD.
   - discontinue amiodarone since no clear indication
   - daily ECG, telemetry
   Hypotension
   Etiology of his hypotension is unclear. Sepsis is possible, patient has
   1 positive blood culture for coag negative staph. Additional
   possibility includes a line infection or super infection of her right
   lower extremity wound. hypovolemia in the setting of hemodialysis also
   possible. No echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
   - follow-up blood and stool cultures
   - resend sputum sample if able
   - consider repeat echocardiogram
   Coag negative staph bacteremia:
 bottles positive. Considering line infection, but it is likely a
   contaminant. Will keep HD line in for now, since it is a new line, and
   only
 bottles
   - continue vancomycin to complete a 14 day course for presumed line
   infection ([**Date range (1) 6463**])
   Left arm swelling: left UE ultrasound
   Rash: possibly related to zosyn that he was on in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].
   Congestive heart failure: EF 50%
   Patient euvolemic, possibly intravascularly dry given hypotension.
   - continue to maintain fluid status with hemodialysis
   CAD
   Patient has no specific history of CAD, although has likely presumed
   CAD in the setting of marked peripheral vascular disease.
   - continue aspirin and statin
   ESRD
   Patient has ESRD for unclear reasons.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - continue HD
   RLE dry gangrene
   Patient needs right AKA per vascular surgery recommendations when
   patient is ""medically stable.""
   - appreciate vascular input, will f/u with then regarding plan for
   timing of surgery
   Seizures
   Patient has had seizures thought likely related to subarachnoid
   hemorrhage in the setting of heparin drip.
   - continue keppra
   Chronic Pain
   Patient has pain likely related to his right foot. He appears in
   moderate control of his pain.
   - continue percocet and fentanyl patch
   Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue eye drops
    Eosinophilia
   Patient has elevated peripheral eosinophils for unclear reasons.
   Etiology is unclear but most likely related to medication effect.
   - continue to trend
   - follow-up strongyloides antibody
   - consider discontinuing vancomycin if no clear indication and if
   eosinophilia persists

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia, which was initially unexplained. It has since resolved and is now presenting with a first-degree AV block. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is also unclear in etiology. Possible causes include sepsis, line infection, super infection of the right lower extremity wound, or hypovolemia related to hemodialysis. Further investigation is required to identify the exact cause.

3. Coag-negative staph bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-negative staph, which may indicate a line infection or bacteremia. This requires close monitoring and appropriate treatment.

4. Left arm swelling: The patient has swelling in the left upper extremity, which may be due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other causes. An ultrasound of the left arm is recommended for further evaluation.

5. Rash: The patient has a rash that may be related to Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) medication. It is necessary to consider this as a potential cause of the rash and explore alternative treatment options if needed.

6. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has an ejection fraction (EF) of 50%,"
