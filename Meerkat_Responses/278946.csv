   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   79yF with history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, DLBCL in remission,
   and bronchial stent in left mainstem bronchus (for compressive
   lymphadenopathy), recent Pseudomonal pneumonia and admission for FUO,
   now presenting with acute shortness of breath, found to have nearly
   complete collapse of the left hemithorax.
   #) Shortness of breath/hypoxia. Likely secondary to mucus plugging of
   left mainstem bronchus. Increased thick secretions concerning for
   pneumonia, especially in setting of recent Pseudomonal pneumonia.
   - Plan for bronchoscopy today with lavage for samples; may need to be
   intubated prior to procedure given poor respiratory reserve
   - Aggressive chest PT
   - Albuterol/ipratropium Nebs PRN, Xopenex and Mucomyst nebs
   - Continue ceftazidime for now, pending bronch/BAL today; will hold on
   other antibiotics
   #) Recent Pseudomonal pneumonia. Continue ceftazidime for now until
   other culture data available.
   #) C. diff infection. Continue PO vancomycin, to finish on [**4-21**].
   #) Fevers. Last admission without obvious etiology, despite extensive
   hematologic, oncologic, and infectious workups. Blood culture pending
   from [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] obtain urine culture (although urinalysis without obvious
   infection in ED).
   - Continue Tylenol, follow up blood cultures.
   #) Non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Currently in remission. Follow up with Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2355**].
   #) Asthma. Continue Advair, albuterol/ipratropium PRN.
   #) Hypothyroidism. Continue levothyroxine.
   #) Hypertension. Continue diltiazem.
   #) F/E/N. IVF as above, monitor/replete electrolytes. NPO for now
   pending procedure.
   #) Prophylaxis. Heparin SubQ, bowel regimen.
   #) Communication. With patient and sons [**Name (NI) 6387**], [**Name (NI) 5113**], and [**Name (NI) 103**]. Son
   [**Name (NI) 6387**] phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6388**]. Son [**Name (NI) 6387**] is HCP, form in chart.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in remission, and bronchial stent in the left mainstem bronchus. The patient was admitted for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and recently had Pseudomonal pneumonia. 

The patient presents with acute shortness of breath and has nearly complete collapse of the left hemithorax. Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 bpm, slightly elevated blood pressure, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.9 degrees Celsius.

The patient has respiratory failure, likely secondary to mucus plugging of the left mainstem bronchus. There is concern for increased thick secretions and the possibility of pneumonia, especially considering the recent Pseudomonal pneumonia. The plan is to perform a bronchoscopy today with lavage for samples and may need to intubate prior to the procedure due to poor respiratory reserve. Aggressive chest physical therapy is recommended, along with nebulizers for albuterol/ipratropium and Xopenex as needed.

The patient also has a recent Pseudomonal pneumonia, so ceftazidime will be continued until other culture data is available. Additionally, the patient has"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in remission, and bronchial stent in the left mainstem bronchus (for compressive lymphadenopathy), recent Pseudomonal pneumonia, and admission for fever of unknown origin (FUO). She presents with acute shortness of breath and nearly complete collapse of the left hemithorax.

The most likely cause of her shortness of breath and hypoxia is a mucus plug obstructing the bronchial stent in the left mainstem. There is low suspicion for infection. The patient has a history of asthma, which may also contribute to her respiratory symptoms. 

The plan includes discussing with the patient's family about performing a bronchoscopy for mucus plug removal, possibly through the endotracheal tube. The patient will be positioned on the right side to improve airflow to the good lung. Aggressive chest physiotherapy will continue, along with the use of Advair with nebulizers as needed. Ceftazidime will be continued for now due to the history of Pseudomonas infection, and culture data from the bronch will be obtained.

The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and will continue taking PO vancomycin until April 21st. Contact precautions will be maintained.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in remission, and a bronchial stent in the left mainstem bronchus (for compressive lymphadenopathy). The patient was admitted for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and now presents with acute shortness of breath and nearly complete collapse of the left hemithorax.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to the near complete collapse of the left lung. This is likely causing acute shortness of breath and hypoxia.

2. Mucus Plug in L Mainstem Bronchus: The CT scan shows opacities filling the left mainstem bronchus, which may reflect mucoid impaction. This could be contributing to the respiratory failure and collapse of the left lung.

3. Pseudomonal Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recent Pseudomonal pneumonia. Although there is no current evidence of infection, it is important to continue antibiotics such as ceftazidime until further culture data from the bronch is obtained.

4. C. diff Infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection. Therefore, it is important to continue PO vancomycin until completion on [**4-21**] and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in remission, and a bronchial stent in the left mainstem bronchus. She presented with acute shortness of breath due to mucus plugging and was found to have nearly complete collapse of the left hemithorax. She was intubated overnight, extubated in the morning, and underwent a repeat bronchoscopy to remove more mucus and purulent material. The sputum culture showed 4+ growth of Gram-negative rods, indicating a possible Pseudomonas infection. Treatment with ceftazidime for Pseudomonas was initiated, and she is currently on aggressive chest physiotherapy, mucolytics, and nebulizers. She also has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and is being treated with oral vancomycin. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 29 to 23, likely due to fluid bolus given during a hypotensive episode. She will receive a blood transfusion and recheck Hct in the evening. The patient's other medical conditions include non-Hodgkin lymphoma (currently in remission), hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and will remain there until she shows clinical improvement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in remission, and bronchial stent in the left mainstem bronchus (for compressive lymphadenopathy). She was admitted for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and presented with acute shortness of breath due to mucus plug in the L mainstem bronchus. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and had improvement after removal of the mucus plug. However, she remained intubated due to hypotension and was later extubated. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and required intubation. Although she showed improvement after bronchoscopy, she still experiences shortness of breath and hypoxia, which may be due to volume loss on the left side and baseline asthma.

2. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient has pseudomonas in her sputum, and there is a risk of worsening infection, especially since she is still producing purulent secretions.

3. Stent Plugging: The patient has a bronchial stent in the left mainstem bronchus, which can become plugged with mucus and secretions. This can lead to further respiratory compromise.

4. Hypotension: The patient experienced"

   remained intubated because of hypotension, now s/p extubation
   yesterday.  Repeat broncoscopy yesterday with more purulent material.
   Now breathing comfortably with nebs and mucolytics.  Xray today  is
   improved but with persistent volume loss on the left.  Her current  SOB
   and hypoxia has likely contribution from this volume loss as well as
   baseline asthma.
   She still has pseudomonas in her sputum.  Given purulence at
   broncoscopy and the fact that this may have contributed to stent
   plugging, we are treating this with ceftazidime, to which the bacteria
   was sensitive from her last hospital stay.
   - continue ceftazidime single-[**Doctor Last Name **] treatment (day 1=[**4-19**], plan 2-week
   course to end [**5-2**])
   - f/u psuedomonas sensitivities
   - she may need long-term suppressive thearpy with inhaled
   aminoglycosides (will plan to discuss this with ID tomorrow)
   - continue mucolytics
   - continue standing nebulizers
   - start methylprednisolone 40 mg daily given likely reactive airway
   component
   - continue chest PT
   - out of bed to chair today
   #) Tachycardia:  yesterday she was somewhat responsive to fluid
   - fluid bolus PRN
   #) Hct drop: Hct bumped appropriately yesterday with 1 unit pRBC.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in remission, and bronchial stent in the left mainstem bronchus for compressive lymphadenopathy. She was admitted for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and recent Pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient presented with acute shortness of breath and was found to have nearly complete collapse of the left hemithorax due to mucus plugging. The mucus plug was removed by an interventional procedure (IP), and the lung re-expanded. However, the patient remained intubated due to hypotension and was later extubated.

The patient has persistent volume loss on the left side, contributing to her current shortness of breath and hypoxia, along with baseline asthma. She still has Pseudomonas in her sputum and is being treated with ceftazidime, to which the bacteria is sensitive. The treatment plan includes a two-week course of ceftazidime, discussion of long-term suppressive therapy with inhaled aminoglycosides, continuation of mucolytics, standing nebulizers, methylprednisolone for reactive airway component, chest physical therapy, and out-of-bed-to-chair activity.

The patient experienced tachycardia, which was somewhat responsive to fluid administration. Fluid bolus is to be given as needed. There"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   79yF with history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, DLBCL in remission,
   and bronchial stent in left mainstem bronchus (for compressive
   lymphadenopathy), recent Pseudomonal pneumonia and admission for FUO,
   now presented with acute shortness of breath, found to have nearly
   complete collapse of the left hemithorax [**1-7**] mucus plugging and much
   improved s/p bronchoscopy.
   #) Shortness of breath/hypoxia: Secondary to mucus plug of stent in L
   mainstem, as visualized on admission CT and at  bronch.  Now s/p
   removal of mucous plug, with re-expansion of lung.   Now extubated and
    breathing comfortably with nebs and mucolytics.  Her current  SOB and
   hypoxia has likely contribution from this volume loss as well as
   baseline asthma for which steroids were begun yesterday.  For her
   ongoing pseudomonas (pan-sensitive) in the sputum, ceftazidime and now
   inhaled tobramycin have been started.
   - continue ceftazidime single-[**Doctor Last Name **] treatment (day 1=[**4-19**], plan 2-week
   course to end [**5-2**])
   - possible long-term suppressive thearpy with inhaled tobramycin,
   started yesterday; plan to discuss with ID today
   - continue mucolytics
   - continue standing nebulizers
   - plan for fast (5-day) steroid burst and then off
   - continue chest PT
   - physical therapy
   #) Tachycardia:  yesterday she was somewhat responsive to fluid
   - fluid bolus PRN
   #) Hct drop: Hct bumped appropriately [**4-20**] with 1 unit pRBC.  Likely
   [**1-7**] fluid bolus given during propofol induced hypotensive episode.  Now
   stable
   - monitor Hct
   .
   #) history of  C. diff infection:  given the re-initiation of
   antibiotics, will need to continue PO vancomycin for at least 2 weeks
   after antibiotics
   - continue PO vancomycin (scheduled to finish [**4-21**])
   - contact precautions
   #) Non-Hodgkins lymphoma:  currently in remission.
   - follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2355**].
   #) Hypothyroidism:  stable
   - continue levothyroxine.
   #) Hypertension
   - continue diltiazem.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in remission, and bronchial stent in the left mainstem bronchus. She was admitted for fever of unknown origin and diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia. She presented with acute shortness of breath due to mucus plugging in the stent, which was successfully removed through bronchoscopy. The patient is now extubated and breathing comfortably with nebulizers and mucolytics. She has ongoing pseudomonas infection in her sputum, for which ceftazidime and inhaled tobramycin have been started. The patient's tachycardia responded to fluid bolus. Her hematocrit dropped after fluid administration during a hypotensive episode, and she received 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and will continue with oral vancomycin for at least 2 weeks after antibiotics. She also has a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. The patient's current medications include levothyroxine, diltiazem, and prophylactic heparin. She is on a regular diet and has an indwelling port. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be called out to the floor today.
