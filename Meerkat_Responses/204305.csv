   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o ESRD s/p B nephrectomy [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease on HD,
   ESLD [**2-8**] polycystic liver disease, admitted myalgias, fever, cough, LLL
   infiltrate on CXR, now intubated [**2-8**] hypoxic respiratory failure, and
   hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Pt's initial presentation considered likely [**2-8**] pulmonary
   infection (viral or bacterial PNA, or influenza with possible 2ndry
   infection).  Other considerations included possible flash pulmonary
   edema [**2-8**] cardiogenic insult, CHF, PE, COPD exacerbation, cardiogenic
   shock.  Given rising lactate, fever, and findings on CTA/CXR, likely
   diagnosis pulmonary infection.
   - ?Pulmonary infection: Started on vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin,
   metronidazole, as well as oseltamivir.  Consider bronchoscopy
   especially given mucus plugging.  Follow sputum, and maintain abx
   (cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole) for at least 10
   days given pt's immunocompromise [**2-8**] liver failure.  Oseltamivir 75mg
   [**Hospital1 **] x5 days (DFA pending).
   - ?Respiratory failure [**2-8**] cardiogenic shock: Repeat echo to confirm
   bedside echo findings.  CEs elevated but flat in context of renal
   failure.
   - ?PE: CTA demonstrated no PE (bedside echo had shown enlarged RV).
   - ?Fluid overload/CHF: CTA not consistent with fluid overload/CHF.
   - ?COPD exacerbation: Possible contribution given infection; on
   hydrocortisone 100 mg IV Q8H for hypotension but will aid in decreasing
   airway inflammation
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - Vent management: Maintain high rate to decrease acidosis.  Use
   ARDSnet protocol given concern for development of ARDS.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock, now requiring three pressors
   with IVF, with norepinephrine being weaned off given pt's tachycardia.
   Source pulmonary most likely, although ?SBP given ascites, ?liver
   abscess.  Hypovolemia contributing given pt's dry clinical exam,
   although no signs of hemorrhage.  CE's flat although elevated (renal
   failure), bedside echo could not definitively r/o WMA.
   - IVF: 150 meq bicarb in D5W to avoid hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
   - Steroids: Hydrocortisone x3 days, to achieve MAP>60
   - Pressor goal: Weaning norepinephrine
   - ?SBP: Diagnostic tap, started levofloxacin which should cover GNR
   - ?Cardiogenic shock: Repeat echo, trend CEs
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock, with increasing lactate,
   resulting in increasing K.  Respiratory rate increased to 32 but
   further increases limited by autopeep.
   - IVF: 150 meq bicarb in D5W to avoid hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
   - Follow ABG: Use bicarb ampules or above IVF solution
   .
   # Shock liver:  Extreme elevation in AST/ALT, LDH, total bilirubin,
   likely [**2-8**] hypotension.
   - Trend LFTs; fluid replete; maintain MAPs>60
   .
   # ESLD: No outpatient hepatologist.  CTA demonstrated no abscess.
   - Liver service consulted; consider transplant suitability
   .
   # Elevated INR: Question [**2-8**] DIC, but fibrinogen and haptoglobin WNL.
   Increase in INR may be [**2-8**] shock liver.  Pt given FFP for HD catheter
   placement.
   .
   # Elevated K: Likely [**2-8**] metabolic acidosis.  Use kayexalate, calcium
   gluconate/insulin/glucose, bicarb to lower.  Expecting to undergo CVVH
   today.
   .
   # Afib with RVR: On digoxin and warfarin as home regimen, with recently
   stopped BB [**2-8**] low BP.  Amiodarone gtt to control RVR, holding
   warfarin.
   .
   # EKG changes: Lateral ST depressions likely rate related; trending
   CEs.  Hold ASA given HD procedures, will need outpt ASA, statin.
   .
   # ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy on HD.  Received temporary HD
   catheter at femoral site.  CVVH planned today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted for myalgias, fever, cough, and left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring vasopressors. The patient has multiple comorbidities including polycystic liver disease, bilateral nephrectomy, emphysema, and atrial fibrillation. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to a pulmonary infection, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other potential diagnoses considered include pulmonary embolism, cardiogenic shock, COPD exacerbation, and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's condition is complicated by metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, and coagulopathy. He has also been found to have an enlarged right ventricle on bedside echo and may require cardiac catheterization. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infection: The patient's initial presentation suggested a likely pulmonary infection, which has been confirmed and is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. Continued monitoring for worsening respiratory status and sputum culture results is necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to the underlying"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o ESRD s/p B nephrectomy [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease on HD,
   ESLD [**2-8**] polycystic liver disease, admitted myalgias, fever, cough, LLL
   infiltrate on CXR, now intubated [**2-8**] hypoxic respiratory failure, and
   hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Pt's initial presentation considered likely [**2-8**] pulmonary
   infection (viral or bacterial PNA, or influenza with possible 2ndry
   infection).  Other considerations included possible flash pulmonary
   edema [**2-8**] cardiogenic insult, CHF, PE, COPD exacerbation, cardiogenic
   shock.  Given rising lactate, fever, and findings on CTA/CXR, likely
   diagnosis (1) acute pulmonary infection, now complicated by ARDS, with
   (2) chronic pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] underlying emphysema/COPD.
   - ARDS [**2-8**] pulmonary infection: Started on vancomycin, cefepime,
   levofloxacin, metronidazole, as well as oseltamivir.  Consider
   bronchoscopy especially given mucus plugging.  Follow sputum, and
   maintain abx (cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole) for at
   least 10 days given pt's immunocompromise [**2-8**] liver failure.
   Oseltamivir 75mg [**Hospital1 **] x5 days (DFA pending).  Currently appears to be
   rapidly progressing to ARDS per (1) bilateral CXR findings, (2)
   PaO2/FiO2 <200mmHg, although (3) unknown whether pulmonary capillary
   wedge pressure (measure of L atrial pressure) is <=18mmHG.
   - Pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema: Massively dilated RV with enlarged
   pulmonary artery evidence for pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema, with
   resultant probable compromise of LV.  Consider placing Swan Ganz
   catheter to assess PA pressures and CO as Vigileo does not accurately
   measure CO in Afib.
   - ?Respiratory failure [**2-8**] cardiogenic shock: Repeat echo to confirm
   bedside echo findings.  CEs elevated but flat in context of renal
   failure.
   - ?PE: CTA demonstrated no PE (bedside echo had shown enlarged RV thus
   triggering concern for PE).
   - ?Fluid overload/CHF: CTA not consistent with fluid overload/CHF.
   - ?COPD exacerbation: Possible contribution given infection; on
   hydrocortisone 100 mg IV Q8H for hypotension but will aid in decreasing
   airway inflammation
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - Vent management: Maintain high rate to decrease acidosis.  Use
   ARDSnet protocol given concern for development of ARDS.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock, now requiring three pressors
   with IVF, with norepinephrine being weaned off given pt's tachycardia.
   Source pulmonary most likely, although ?SBP given ascites (no liver
   abscess per CTA).  Hypovolemia contributing given pt's dry clinical
   exam, although no signs of hemorrhage.  CE's flat although elevated
   (renal failure), bedside echo could not definitively r/o WMA.
   - Hold on repleting fluids given enlarged RV
   - Steroids: Hydrocortisone x3 days, to achieve MAP>60
   - Pressor goal: Weaning norepinephrine
   - ?SBP: Hold on diagnostic tap, as started levofloxacin which should
   cover GNR
   - ?Cardiogenic shock: Repeat echo (CEs have been flat)
   .
   # Distended abdomen: Markedly and newly distended on clinical exam,
   concern for SBO, ileus, or bowel perforation (especially given rising
   lactate)
   - Measure bladder pressure (no urine needed)
   - KUB
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock, with increasing lactate,
   resulting in increasing K (although concern for bowel pathology).
   Respiratory rate increased to 32 but further increases limited by
   autopeep.
   .
   # Shock liver:  Extreme elevation in AST/ALT, LDH, total bilirubin,
   likely [**2-8**] hypotension.
   - Trend LFTs; maintain MAPs>60
   .
   # ESLD: No outpatient hepatologist.  CTA demonstrated no abscess.
   - Liver service consulted; consider transplant suitability
   .
   # Elevated INR: Question [**2-8**] DIC, but fibrinogen and haptoglobin WNL.
   Increase in INR may be [**2-8**] shock liver.  Pt given FFP for HD catheter
   placement.
   .
   # Elevated K: Likely [**2-8**] metabolic acidosis.  Use kayexalate, calcium
   gluconate/insulin/glucose, bicarb to lower.  Expecting to undergo CVVH
   today.
   .
   # Afib with RVR: On digoxin and warfarin as home regimen, with recently
   stopped BB [**2-8**] low BP.  Amiodarone gtt to control RVR, holding warfarin
   (note amiodarone IV solution can decrease BP).
   .
   # EKG changes: Lateral ST depressions likely rate related; trending
   CEs.  Hold ASA given HD procedures, will need outpt ASA, statin.
   .
   # ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy on HD.  Received temporary HD
   catheter at femoral site.  CVVH planned today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post bilateral nephrectomy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was transferred to the hospital for respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He is also hypotensive and requires vasopressors. The patient has a distended abdomen and is showing signs of shock liver with elevated liver enzymes. There are concerns about possible septic shock, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and cardiogenic shock. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, steroids, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute pulmonary infection, now complicated by ARDS. This is evident from the bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and rapid progression of respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary HTN: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to underlying emphysema/COPD, as indicated by the enlarged main pulmonary artery and right ventricular dilation on the CT angiography (CTA).
3. Cardiogenic shock: There is a concern for cardiogenic shock due to compromised left ventricular function, as shown by the findings of an enlarged right ventricle and evidence of pulmonary hypertension."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yr old man with renal and kidney disease presents with hypoxemic
   resp distress and hypotension
   1.       Shock: Sepsis is primary concern given rigors and hypotension.
   DDx influenza, check DFA, isolate, atypicals. Would also consider abd
   source, checking Abd US
 tap if ascites. Also ruptured or infected
   kidney or cyst. HD chronic via fistula but would still culture Blood
   cx.
   At this point, would give 500 CC bolus, trend Sco2 and lactate, broad
   spectrum ABX with Vanco, Levoquin, Cefipime.
   2.       Hypoxemic resp Distress: DDx infectious etiologies are of
   primary concern though without focal infiltrates makes viral and
   atypicals higher on list. Pulm edema with RVR also concerning and with
   ESRD we cannot diuresis but would need HD. Full vent support tonight
   and will reassess for PSV in AM
   3.       Afib with RVR- likely exacerbation in setting of sepsis.
   Maintained on dig and bblocker at home
 we are Amio loading now. Is
   anti coag
 will hold for now in light of potential procedures.  Does
   have lat ECG changes when going fast and flat CK but + trop . ASA
   statin, bblocker when able. Echo in AM.
   4.       ESRD; for HD in AM, renally dose all meds, repeat K tonight
   5.       ESLD: LFTs are within normal limits, abd US pending, tap if
   ascites, hepatology to see in AM. Likely full imaging of ABD with CT if
   US unrevealing.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with renal and kidney disease presenting with hypoxemic respiratory distress and hypotension. The primary concern is sepsis, indicated by rigors and low blood pressure. Other potential causes for his condition include influenza, abdominal source (such as ascites or an abdominal infection), and ruptured or infected kidney or cyst. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 105/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a history of congestive heart failure.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. His electrolytes show low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas reveals respiratory acidosis.

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 90%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 22 mmHg, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 90%. The patient's urine output has been 250 mL since admission.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs indicate an elevated heart rate (100 bpm), low blood pressure (105/71 mmHg), and a high respiratory rate (30 breaths per minute). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 90% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.17, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 134, indicating respiratory acidosis and moderate hypoxemia.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.2 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 291 mg/dL, and an increased lactate level of 4.7 mmol/L, suggesting systemic inflammation and possible organ dysfunction.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP) monitor, and urinary catheter. The patient is receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain adequate blood pressure. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 6.1 mg/dL.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with renal and kidney disease who presented with hypoxemic respiratory distress and hypotension. The primary concern is sepsis, as indicated by rigors and hypotension. Other potential complications and considerations include:

1. Shock: Given the patient's symptoms of hypotension and rigors, sepsis is a primary concern. Differential diagnosis includes influenza, and DFA testing should be done to isolate any pathogens. An ultrasound without ascites should be considered to rule out any abdominal sources of infection. The patient's chronic vascular access fistula may also be contributing to bacteremia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The possibility of placing a pulmonary artery line and performing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) to unload the right ventricle (RV) should be considered.

2. ARDS: The patient's development of bilateral fluffy infiltrates suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Initial infectious etiologies are of primary concern, especially viral and atypical pathogens. The patient is already on conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), and an esophageal balloon should be placed to better assess transpulmonary pressure. Ventilatory strategy should follow ARDSNet guidelines, aiming to wean FiO2 as tolerated while maintaining adequate oxygenation.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yr old man with renal and kidney disease presents with hypoxemic
   resp distress and hypotension
   1.       Shock: Sepsis is primary concern given rigors and hypotension.
   DDx influenza, check DFA, isolate, atypicals. Would also consider abd
   source, US without ascities. Awiating formal read of Abd CT but no
   obvious ruptured or infected kidney or liver cyst. HD chronic via
   fistula but considering bacteremia. While cardiogenic etiology may be
   contributing given horrible RV- suspect it may not be all acute but
   seems less likely
 given dil PA, neg CTA for acute PE. Non invasive CO
   - ? reliability given Afib and fistula. Broad spectrum ABX with Vanco,
   Cefipime, Levoquin, and Flagyl
                           :Shock and bad RV
 is RV overloaded and
   impairing lV filling. Options PA line, would need FFP and tech
                            challenging due to wide open TR and hige RV.
   Empiric inhaled NO and possibly running slightly neg with
                             CVVHD  to unload the RV
 i.e run negative to
   CVVHD even on pressors and assess impact.
                           : check KUB for abd distension, trend lactate,
   consider surgical consult if ABD CT/KUB abnl or worsening lactate
   2.       ARDS: DDx initial infectious etiologies are of primary concern
   started  without focal infiltrates makes viral and atypicals higher on
   list. Now bilat fluffly infiltrates. Pulm edema with RVR also
   concerning and with ESRD we cannot diuresis but will need CVVHD for
   help with that.
                            : Vent strategy ARDSNET
 now on CMV, place
   esophageal balloon to better assess tranpulmonary pressure
                            :  Continue high PEEP low TV, try to wean FIO2
   as tolerated.
   3.       Afib with RVR- likely exacerbation in setting of sepsis.
   Maintained on dig and bblocker at home
 we are Amio loading now. Is
   anti coag
  Does have lat ECG changes when going fast and flat CK but
   + trop . ASA statin, bblocker when able. Follow up formal read on Echo.
   4.       ESRD: for CVVHD this AM
 would favor trials to get some
   volume off, renally dose all meds, watch K
   5.       ESLD: LFTs are rising but in setting of shock, abd US without
   ascites, hepatology following. Await formal read of CT-

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with renal and kidney disease who presented with hypoxemic respiratory distress and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires multiple interventions to stabilize his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension and rigors indicate septic shock as the primary concern. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further investigations are ongoing to identify the source of infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening lung function and development of bilateral fluffy infiltrates suggest the possibility of ARDS. ventilatory support is being provided, and the strategy will be adjusted based on the patient's response.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's rapid heart rate and irregular rhythm are concerning. Anti-coagulation therapy is being initiated, and efforts will be made to control the heart rate and restore sinus rhythm.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's chronic kidney disease has progressed to ESRD. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) has been initiated to manage his renal function and remove waste products.
5. End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD):"

   respiratory failure, and hypotensive requiring pressors.
   ARDS: Pt has ARDS secondary to influenza A. Also involved is RV failure
   and pulmonary hypertension, most likely secondary to underlying
   emphysema/COPD.
   - Influeza A: continue Tamiflu 75mg daily (given ESRD). day [**2-11**] (day 1
   [**4-7**])
   - discontinue flagyl
   - Continue vancomycin,  renally dosed and cefepime.
   - ARDS secondary to influenza: vent at ARDS settings as blood pressure
   tolerates. Currently at low peep given hypotension
   - esophageal balloon pressure is negative implying PEEP is too low, but
   not tolerated high secondary to hypotension
   - ARDs per (1) bilateral CXR findings, (2) PaO2/FiO2 <200mmHg, although
   (3) unknown whether pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (measure of L
   atrial pressure) is <=18mmHG.
   - Pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema: Massively dilated RV with enlarged
   pulmonary artery evidence for pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema, with
   resultant probable compromise of LV.  Consider placing Swan Ganz
   catheter to assess PA pressures and CO as Vigileo does not accurately
   measure CO in Afib.
   - ?Respiratory failure [**2-8**] cardiogenic shock: f/u echo to confirm
   bedside echo findings.
   - PE ruled out  by CTA
   - ?COPD exacerbation: Possible contribution given infection; on
   hydrocortisone 100 mg IV Q8H for hypotension but will aid in decreasing
   airway inflammation
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - Vent management:continue high rate to decrease acidosis.  Use ARDSnet
   protocol given concern for development of ARDS. increase peep as
   tolerated
   # Hypotension: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock from influenza and possible
   other etiology, now requiring three pressors with IVF, with
   norepinephrine being weaned off given pt's tachycardia.  Source
   pulmonary most likely, although ?SBP given ascites (no liver abscess

   Phenylephrine 4.0 and vasopressin
   - Hold on repleting fluids given enlarged RV
   - Steroids: Hydrocortisone x3 days, to achieve MAP>60
   - Pressor goal: Weaning norepinephrine as tolerated
   - ?SBP: Hold on diagnostic tap, as started levofloxacin which should
   cover GNR
   - ?Cardiogenic shock: f/u echo
   # Distended abdomen: Markedly and newly distended on clinical exam,
   concern for SBO, ileus, or bowel perforation (especially given rising
   lactate)
   - bladder pressure 10mmgHg -- within normal limits
   - KUB showing no air underdiaphragm, likely ileus
   - NG tube to suction
   # ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy on HD.  Received temporary HD
   catheter at femoral site.  CVVH running
   - 75 cc off/hour
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock, with now decreasing
   lactate. Respiratory rate increased to 32 but further increases limited
   by autopeep.
   # Shock liver:  Extreme elevation in AST/ALT, LDH, total bilirubin,
   likely [**2-8**] hypotension.
   - Trend LFTs; maintain MAPs>60
   # ESLD: No outpatient hepatologist.  CTA demonstrated no abscess.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease, admitted for myalgias, fever, cough, and left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring vasopressors.

The patient's current condition is critical with multiple organ dysfunctions. He has ARDS secondary to influenza A, RV failure, pulmonary hypertension, and severe sepsis or septic shock. The patient is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), progression of sepsis or septic shock, worsening liver dysfunction, and potential bleeding due to coagulopathy.

Further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions should focus on optimizing respiratory support, managing fluid balance, addressing electrolyte imbalances, controlling infection, and providing supportive care for multiple organ systems."

   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o ESRD s/p B nephrectomy [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease on HD,
   ESLD [**2-8**] polycystic liver disease, admitted myalgias, fever, cough, LLL
   infiltrate on CXR, now intubated [**2-8**] hypercarbic  respiratory failure,
   and hypotensive requiring pressors.
   # Hypercarbia: Pt's initial presentation considered likely [**2-8**]
   pulmonary infection, and patient found to be influenza A positive.
   Other considerations included possible flash pulmonary edema [**2-8**]
   cardiogenic insult, CHF, PE, COPD exacerbation, cardiogenic shock.
   Given rising lactate, fever, and findings on CTA/CXR, likely diagnosis
   (1) influenza A, now complicated by ARDS, with (2) chronic pulmonary
   HTN [**2-8**] underlying emphysema/COPD.
   - Influeza A: continue Tamiflu 75mg daily (given ESRD). day [**2-11**] (day 1
   [**4-7**])
   - can discontinue flagyl and levaquin.  Also on vancomycin renally
   dosed and cefepime.
   - ARDS secondary to influenza: vent at ARDS settings as blood pressure
   tolerates. Currently at low peep given hypotension
   - esophageal balloon pressure is negative implying PEEP is too low, but
   not tolerated high secondary to hypotension
   - ARDs per (1) bilateral CXR findings, (2) PaO2/FiO2 <200mmHg, although
   (3) unknown whether pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (measure of L
   atrial pressure) is <=18mmHG.
   - Pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema: Massively dilated RV with enlarged
   pulmonary artery evidence for pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema, with
   resultant probable compromise of LV.  Consider placing Swan Ganz
   catheter to assess PA pressures and CO as Vigileo does not accurately
   measure CO in Afib.
   - ?Respiratory failure [**2-8**] cardiogenic shock: f/u echo to confirm
   bedside echo findings.
   - PE ruled out  by CTA
   - ?COPD exacerbation: Possible contribution given infection; on
   hydrocortisone 100 mg IV Q8H for hypotension but will aid in decreasing
   airway inflammation
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - Vent management:continue high rate to decrease acidosis.  Use ARDSnet
   protocol given concern for development of ARDS. increase peep as
   tolerated
   # Hypotension: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock from influenza and possible
   other etiology, now requiring three pressors with IVF, with
   norepinephrine being weaned off given pt's tachycardia.  Source
   pulmonary most likely, although ?SBP given ascites (no liver abscess
   per CTA).  Hypovolemia contributing given pt's dry clinical exam,
   although no signs of hemorrhage.  CE's flat although elevated (renal
   failure), bedside echo could not definitively r/o WMA.'
   - on and off norepinepherine throughout the night 0.02 this AM.
   Phenylephrine 4.0 and vasopressin
   - Hold on repleting fluids given enlarged RV
   - Steroids: Hydrocortisone x3 days, to achieve MAP>60
   - Pressor goal: Weaning norepinephrine as tolerated
   - ?SBP: Hold on diagnostic tap, as started levofloxacin which should
   cover GNR
   - ?Cardiogenic shock: f/u echo
   # Distended abdomen: Markedly and newly distended on clinical exam,
   concern for SBO, ileus, or bowel perforation (especially given rising
   lactate)
   - bladder pressure 10mmgHg -- within normal limits
   - KUB showing no air underdiaphragm, likely ileus
   - NG tube to suction
   # ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy on HD.  Received temporary HD
   catheter at femoral site.  CVVH running
   - 75 cc off/hour
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock, with now decreasing
   lactate. Respiratory rate increased to 32 but further increases limited
   by autopeep.
   # Shock liver:  Extreme elevation in AST/ALT, LDH, total bilirubin,
   likely [**2-8**] hypotension.
   - Trend LFTs; maintain MAPs>60
   # ESLD: No outpatient hepatologist.  CTA demonstrated no abscess.
   - Liver service consulted; consider transplant suitability
   # Elevated INR: Question [**2-8**] DIC, but fibrinogen and haptoglobin WNL.
   Increase in INR may be [**2-8**] shock liver.  Pt given FFP for HD catheter
   placement.
   # Elevated K: Likely [**2-8**] metabolic acidosis.  Use kayexalate, calcium
   gluconate/insulin/glucose, bicarb to lower.  Expecting to undergo CVVH
   today.
   # Afib with RVR: On digoxin and warfarin as home regimen, with recently
   stopped BB [**2-8**] low BP.
   - Amiodarone gtt 0.5/hour to control RVR (note amiodarone IV solution
   can decrease BP)
   - consider switching to PO
   - holding warfarin.
   # EKG changes: Lateral ST depressions likely rate related; trending
   CEs.  Hold ASA given HD procedures, will need outpt ASA, statin.
   - no need to follow cardiac enzymes.

   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o ESRD s/p B nephrectomy [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease on HD,
   ESLD [**2-8**] polycystic liver disease, admitted myalgias, fever, cough, LLL
   infiltrate on CXR, now intubated [**2-8**] hypoxic hypercarbic ARDs related
   respiratory failure, and hypotensive requiring pressors.
   ARDS: Pt has ARDS secondary to influenza A. Also involved is RV failure
   and pulmonary hypertension, most likely secondary to underlying
   emphysema/COPD.
   - Vent: vent at ARDS settings. Patient tolerated FiO2 of 40% (from 50%)
   this AM, will decrease PEEP to 8.
   - Influeza A: continue Tamiflu 75mg daily (given ESRD). day [**2-11**] (day 1
   [**4-7**])
   - discontinue flagyl
   - Continue vancomycin, levaquin and cefepime until cultures negative
   for 48-72 hours.
   - f/u esophageal balloon pressure
   - Pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema: Massively dilated RV with enlarged
   pulmonary artery evidence for pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema, with
   resultant probable compromise of LV.  Will contact outpatient
   cardiologist and pulmonolgist for history of this
   - Will consider swan if unable to wean off pressors.
   - Respiratory failure [**2-8**] cardiogenic shock: f/u echo to confirm
   bedside echo findings.
   - PE ruled out  by CTA
   - likely not COPD exacerbation, d.c steroids
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock from influenza and possible other
   etiology, now off of norepinephrine. Also has cardiac etiology given rt
   ventricle failure impeding his LV output.
   - patient now off norepinephrine
   - plan to discontinue vasopressin, then wean off phenylephrine
   - d/c steroids
   - ?Cardiogenic shock: f/u echo
   Distended abdomen: Markedly and newly distended on clinical exam,
   concern for SBO, ileus, or bowel perforation (especially given rising
   lactate). Considering ischemic bowel given lactate while in CVVH.
   - bladder pressure 10mmgHg -- within normal limits
   - KUB showing no air underdiaphragm, likely ileus
   - NG tube to suction
   - surgery consult appreciated: not surgical candidate
   ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy on HD.  Received temporary HD catheter
   at femoral site.  CVVH running
   - increase to 100cc/hr out
   Metabolic acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis. Lactic acid
   decreasing, but in the setting of CVVH, posible that that patient has
   ischemic bowel. Surgery consult appreciated
   Shock liver:  Extreme elevation in AST/ALT, LDH, total bilirubin,
   likely [**2-8**] hypotension.
   - Trend LFTs; maintain MAPs>60
   ESLD: No outpatient hepatologist.  CTA demonstrated no abscess.
   - Liver service consulted; consider transplant suitability
   Elevated INR: Question [**2-8**] DIC, but fibrinogen and haptoglobin WNL.
   Increase in INR may be [**2-8**] shock liver.  Pt given FFP for HD catheter
   placement.
   - FFP as needed
   - DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   Afib with RVR: On digoxin and warfarin as home regimen, with recently
   stopped BB [**2-8**] low BP.
   - change amiodarone to IV BID dosing
   - d/c digoxin while in CVVH
   - holding warfarin.
   EKG changes: Lateral ST depressions likely rate related; trending CEs.
   Hold ASA given HD procedures, will need outpt ASA, statin.
   - no need to follow cardiac enzymes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease, admitted for myalgias, fever, cough, and left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. He is now intubated and on ARDS settings.
- The patient has ARDS secondary to influenza A, RV failure, and pulmonary hypertension, most likely secondary to underlying emphysema/COPD.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 107/65 mmHg, heart rate of 103 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient has a markedly and newly distended abdomen, concern for small bowel obstruction (SBO), ileus, or bowel perforation.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 490 mL, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.
- The patient has an elevated lactate level, indicating possible ischemic bowel, and is running continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH).
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock liver, and an elevated INR, possibly due to DIC or shock liver. The patient has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for HD catheter placement.

   Elevated INR: Question [**2-8**] DIC, but fibrinogen and haptoglobin WNL.
   Increase in INR may be [**2-8**] shock liver.  Pt given FFP for HD catheter
   placement.
   - FFP as needed
   - DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   Afib with RVR: On digoxin and warfarin as home regimen, with recently

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease, who is currently on hemodialysis (HD). The patient also has end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to polycystic liver disease and is awaiting a liver transplant. The patient was admitted with myalgias, fever, cough, and left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation. The patient's ARDS is secondary to influenza A infection and is complicated by right ventricular (RV) failure and pulmonary hypertension, likely due to underlying emphysema/COPD.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension requiring vasopressors, shock liver with elevated liver enzymes, metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate levels, elevated INR, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and EKG changes consistent with ischemia. The patient's abdomen is distended, and there are concerns for small bowel obstruction (SBO), ileus, or bowel perforation. The patient's current medications include Tamiflu, vancomycin, levaquin, cefepime, midazolam, vasopressin, norepinephrine, amiodarone, fentanyl, and phenylephrine.

   67 yr old man with renal and kidney disease presents with hypoxemic
   resp distress and hypotension
   1.       Shock: Sepsis due to Influenza +/- secondary bacterial
   infection however his shock is complicated by
                  RV overloaded and impairing lV filling we are using
   CVVHD  to unload the RV
 i.e run negative to CVVHD even on
                  pressors and assess impact.
                    : we have considered risk versus benefit of PA line,
   challenging due to wide open TR  and big RV. Will place if
                      we stop being able to wean pressors
                    : Another option would be empiric inhaled NO to unload
   RV.
                           : KUB + abd distension, trend lactate, consider
   surgical consult if exam change or worsening lactate
                           : Broad spectrum ABX with Vanco, Cefipime,
   Levoquin, and Flagyl
   2.       ARDS  : with underlying emphysema and
   Influenza
                      : Vent strategy ARDSNET
 now on CMV, placed eso
   balloon and got TP of -6 to 01 on 18 PEEP and -9 to -4
                         on 10 PEEP. In light of excellent oxygenation,
   minimal improvement with large PEEP swings and shock hold\
                         at lowest PEEP needed. Reshoot esophageal
   balloon.
                             :  wean FIO2
   3.       Afib with RVR- likely exacerbation in setting of sepsis.
   Getting Amio- held Dig. Auto anti coag
  Did have lat ECG changes when
   going fast and flat CK but + trop . No ASA bleedin, no statin shock
   liver.
   4.     ESRD: for CVVHD this AM
 would favor trials to get some volume
   off, renally dose all meds, watch K

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of renal and kidney disease who presented with hypoxemic respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to Influenza A infection, possibly with a secondary bacterial infection. The shock is complicated by right ventricular overload and impaired left ventricular filling. To manage this, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) is being used to unload the right ventricle (RV) by running negative fluids through the CVVHD circuit.

2. ARDS: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with underlying emphysema and influenza infection. The current ventilator strategy being used is ARDSNet, and the patient is on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with an endotracheal tube placed and esophageal balloon for measurement of intra-abdominal pressure.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely exacerbated by sepsis. Amiodarone is being held, and digoxin is being considered. The patient is also on automatic anticoagulation.

4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient requires renal replacement therapy for CVVHD, and trials are being conducted to remove some volume, with medications dos"

   67 yr old man with renal and kidney disease presents with hypoxemic
   resp distress and hypotension
   1.       Shock: Sepsis due to Influenza +/- secondary bacterial
   infection however his shock is complicated by
                  RV overload, pulm HTN, and likely impaired LV filling.
   We are using CVVHD  to unload the RV
 i.e run negative to
                  CVVHD even on  pressors and assess impact. Thus far
   getting him negative we have been weaning pressors
                    : we have considered risk versus benefit of PA line,
   challenging due to wide open TR  and big RV. Will place if
                      we stop being able to wean pressors
                    : Another option would be empiric inhaled NO to unload
   RV.
                           : KUB + abd distension, trend lactate,
   surgical consulted
                           : Broad spectrum ABX with Vanco, Cefipime,
   Levoquin, and Flagyl
   2.       ARDS  : with underlying emphysema and
   Influenza
                      : Vent strategy ARDSNET
 now on CMV, placed eso
   balloon and got TP of -6 to 01 on 18 PEEP and -9 to -4
                         on 10 PEEP. In light of excellent oxygenation,
   minimal improvement with large PEEP swings and shock hold\
                         at lowest PEEP needed. Reshoot esophageal
   balloon.
                             :  wean FIO2
   3.       Afib with RVR- likely exacerbation in setting of sepsis.
   Getting Amio- held Dig. Auto anti coag
  Did have lat ECG changes when
   going fast and flat CK but + trop . No ASA bleeding, no statin shock
   liver.
   4.     ESRD: on CVVH
 would favor trials to get some volume off,
   renally dose all meds, watch K
   5.     ESLD: LFTs are rising but in setting of shock, abd US without
   ascites, hepatology following.
   6.       High inr: was anticoag then shock and quinolone, getting FFP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of renal and kidney disease. He presented with hypoxemic respiratory distress and hypotension. The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to influenza infection, which may be complicated by right ventricular (RV) overload, pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), and impaired left ventricular filling. CVVHD is being used to unload the RV.

2. ARDS: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with underlying emphysema and influenza infection. The ventilator strategy includes using ARDSNET with CMV mode, placed esophageal balloon, and adjusting PEEP levels.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is likely experiencing an exacerbation of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely due to sepsis. Amiodarone is being held, and digoxin is being considered.

4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and may require trials to remove excess volume. Renal dosing of medications is also necessary.

5. End-stage liver disease (ESLD): The patient's liver function tests are rising, but in the setting of shock, an abdominal ultrasound without ascites suggests hepatology follow-up.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and influenza. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has a distended abdomen.

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), elevated lactate, and elevated troponin levels. His coagulation profile indicates an increased INR, but fibrinogen and haptoglobin levels are within normal range. The patient's kidney function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level.

The patient's imaging studies reveal findings consistent with ARDS, including consolidations and effusions in the lungs. An echocardiogram shows mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate right ventricular dilation with severe global hypokinesis. There is no evidence of aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, but mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure due to ARDS"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and polycystic kidney disease. He is also diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza, pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and emphysema/COPD.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with assisted spontaneous breathing and is receiving various medications including levofloxacin, oseltamivir, cefepime, and vancomycin.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 225.
- The patient's renal function is compromised with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 L/min and serum creatinine level of 4.2 mg/dL.
- The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 220,000/mm3 and an INR of 3.5.
- The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), lactate, and total bilirubin levels.
- The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) and has a temporary HD catheter at the femoral site.
- The patient's abdomen is distended but stable.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and is currently being managed with amiodarone.
- The patient is a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and has a code status of DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to worsening respiratory failure and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's PHTN may worsen due to the underlying lung disease and ARDS, leading to right ventricular overload and potential cardiogenic shock.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially during procedures or if anticoagulant therapy is required.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's ESLD may worsen, leading to further elevation in liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as potential hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's ESRD may progress, resulting in further deterioration in renal function and the need for long-term dialysis.
6. Infection: The patient is at high risk for developing hospital-acquired infections, particularly pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   pulmonary HTN, on levofloxacin (day1 = [**4-6**]), oseltamivir (day1 =
   [**4-6**]), cefepime (day1 = [**4-6**])
   ARDS: Pt has ARDS secondary to influenza A. Also involved is RV failure
   and pulmonary hypertension, most likely secondary to underlying
   emphysema/COPD.
   - Vent: vent at ARDS settings. Patient tolerated FiO2 of 40% (from 50%)
   this AM, will decrease PEEP to 8.
   - Influeza A: continue Tamiflu 75mg daily (given ESRD). day [**2-11**] (day 1
   [**4-7**])
   - discontinue flagyl
   - Continue vancomycin, levaquin and cefepime until cultures negative
   for 48-72 hours.
   - f/u esophageal balloon pressure
   - Pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema: Massively dilated RV with enlarged
   pulmonary artery evidence for pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema, with
   resultant probable compromise of LV.  Will contact outpatient
   cardiologist and pulmonolgist for history of this
   - Will consider swan if unable to wean off pressors.
   - Respiratory failure [**2-8**] cardiogenic shock: f/u echo to confirm
   bedside echo findings.
   - PE ruled out  by CTA
   - likely not COPD exacerbation, d.c steroids
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   2.       ARDS  : with underlying emphysema and
   Influenza
                      : Vent strategy ARDSNET
 now on CMV, placed eso
   balloon and got TP of -6 to 01 on 18 PEEP and -9 to -4
                         on 10 PEEP. In light of excellent oxygenation,
   minimal improvement with large PEEP swings and shock hold\
                         at lowest PEEP needed. Reshoot esophageal
   balloon.
                             :  wean FIO2
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-8**] septic shock from influenza and possible other
   etiology, now off of norepinephrine. Also has cardiac etiology given rt
   ventricle failure impeding his LV output.
   - patient now off norepinephrine
   - plan to discontinue vasopressin, then wean off phenylephrine
   - d/c steroids
   - ?Cardiogenic shock: f/u echo
   1.       Shock: Sepsis due to Influenza +/- secondary bacterial
   infection however his shock is complicated by
                  RV overload, pulm HTN, and likely impaired LV filling.
   We are using CVVHD  to unload the RV
 i.e run negative to
                  CVVHD even on  pressors and assess impact. Thus far
   getting him negative we have been weaning pressors
                    : we have considered risk versus benefit of PA line,
   challenging due to wide open TR  and big RV. Will place if
                      we stop being able to wean pressors
                    : Another option would be empiric inhaled NO to unload
   RV.
                           : KUB + abd distension, trend lactate,
   surgical consulted
                           : Broad spectrum ABX with Vanco, Cefipime,
   Levoquin, and Flagyl
   Distended abdomen: Markedly and newly distended on clinical exam,
   concern for SBO, ileus, or bowel perforation (especially given rising
   lactate). Considering ischemic bowel given lactate while in CVVH.
   - bladder pressure 10mmgHg -- within normal limits
   - KUB showing no air underdiaphragm, likely ileus
   - NG tube to suction
   - surgery consult appreciated: not surgical candidate
   ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy on HD.  Received temporary HD catheter
   at femoral site.  CVVH running
   - increase to 100cc/hr out
   Metabolic acidosis: likely secondary to lactic acidosis. Lactic acid
   decreasing, but in the setting of CVVH, posible that that patient has
   ischemic bowel. Surgery consult appreciated
   Shock liver:  Extreme elevation in AST/ALT, LDH, total bilirubin,
   likely [**2-8**] hypotension.
   - Trend LFTs; maintain MAPs>60
   ESLD: No outpatient hepatologist.  CTA demonstrated no abscess.
   - Liver service consulted; consider transplant suitability
   Elevated INR: Question [**2-8**] DIC, but fibrinogen and haptoglobin WNL.
   Increase in INR may be [**2-8**] shock liver.  Pt given FFP for HD catheter
   placement.
   - FFP as needed
   - DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   Afib with RVR: On digoxin and warfarin as home regimen, with recently
   stopped BB [**2-8**] low BP.
   - change amiodarone to IV BID dosing
   - d/c digoxin while in CVVH
   - holding warfarin.
   3.       Afib with RVR- likely exacerbation in setting of sepsis.
   Getting Amio- held Dig. Auto anti coag
  Did have lat ECG changes when
   going fast and flat CK but + trop . No ASA bleeding, no statin shock
   liver.
   4.     ESRD: on CVVH
 would favor trials to get some volume off,
   renally dose all meds, watch K
   5.     ESLD: LFTs are rising but in setting of shock, abd US without
   ascites, hepatology following.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease, end-stage renal disease, polycystic kidney disease, ARDS secondary to influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and underlying emphysema/COPD. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with ARDSNet strategy. The patient has been weaned off norepinephrine and is now on vasopressin and phenylephrine. CVVHD is being run to unload the right ventricle. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. He also has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, likely due to shock liver. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, but not consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's abdominal distension is concerning for small bowel obstruction, ileus, or bowel perforation. Surgical consultation was sought but the patient is not a surgical candidate. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently on amiodarone and warfarin. 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and disposition is pending."

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease, end-stage renal disease, polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and on multiple antibiotics. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with various medical complications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 490 mL and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL, platelet count of 220 K/uL, creatinine level of 4.2 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 116 mg/dL. His liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are significantly elevated, indicating liver injury or dysfunction. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) of 33.3 seconds and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 39.5 seconds, suggesting impaired blood clotting function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with chronic renal and kidney disease who is now experiencing respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly a bacterial superinfection. He is critically ill and requires intensive care unit (ICU) care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to underlying emphysema and influenza infection. Hypoxemia is improving, but he still requires mechanical ventilation support.

2. Shock: The patient is in shock, which is likely caused by sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection. His shock is complicated by right ventricular (RV) volume overload, and there is a possibility that his RV was off the Starling curve.

3. Right Ventricular Dysfunction: The patient has RV dysfunction, as indicated by RV dilation and free wall hypokinesis on the echocardiogram. This could be a result of the patient's chronic pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress.

4. Liver Disease: The patient has end-stage liver disease with an acute component of ischemic hepatitis (shock liver). Hepatology is following the case and will discuss amiodarone with them.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient is likely experiencing coagulopathy, which is related to shock, synthetic dysfunction, and warfarin in the setting of receiving quinolone and amiodarone.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to ARDS and suspected secondary bacterial infection, septic shock, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and distended abdomen.

The patient's recent progress includes the removal of more fluid due to the distended abdomen. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/51 mmHg to 119/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 96, using CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume set at 490 mL and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with significantly elevated AST and ALT levels. Blood cultures have been obtained, showing sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora and negative results for ova and parasites. Imaging studies reveal air-filled distended loops of the left colon."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch tall, 95 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and shock. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was rebolused. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is responding well. The patient has allergies to penicillins and enalapril, and there is an unknown allergy to amiodarone. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 120/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, trace edema in both extremities, and normal neurologic examination. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure indicates a potential risk of continued respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Shock: The patient's history of shock suggests a compromised cardiovascular status. Monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure and heart rate, is crucial to assess the patient's response to treatment.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's pre-existing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications like thromboembolism.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with chronic renal and kidney disease who is now experiencing respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly bacterial superinfection. His respiratory status and shock have improved, but his mental status remains depressed. The patient has underlying emphysema and influenza. He is currently on CVVH for ESRD and will keep an even to slightly negative fluid balance today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to underlying emphysema and influenza. If not managed properly, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock secondary to sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection. If not treated promptly and effectively, the patient may continue to deteriorate and develop organ dysfunction.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status remains depressed, which may indicate a risk for delirium or cognitive impairment. Close monitoring and management of the patient's mental status is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Liver Disease: The patient has a history of end-stage liver disease with an acute component of ischemic hepatitis (shock liver). This poses a risk for hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely related to shock, synthetic dysfunction, and warfarin use. There is a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yr old man with chronic renal and kidney disease now with
   respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly
   bacterial superinfection.  His respiratory status and shock have
   improved, but his mental status remains depressed.
   Shock
          Sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection.
          Treat influenza
          Day 5 / 10 for presumptive bacterial superinfection (cx
   obtained after antibiotics)
          I suspect we have gotten back toward the right area of his
   RV Starling curve.  Will run about even or only very slightly negative
   today.
   Respiratory failure
   With underlying emphysema and Influenza
   Doing well, but mental status prevents extubation trial at present
   Afib with RVR
   Likely exacerbation in setting of sepsis.
   Still challenging to manage
   Discuss amiodarone with liver team.  If they are concerned, consult EP
   for recommendations for other anti-arrythmics, given his underlying
   liver disease.
   ESRD
   On CVVH.  Will keep even to slightly negative today
   Abdominal distention
   Put NG to suction
   Liver disease
   By history, he has end-stage liver disease.  However, there is an acute
   component of ischemic hepatitis (shock liver) as well.  Hepatology is
   following; will discuss amiodarone with them.
   Coagulopathy
   Likely related to shock, synthetic dysfunction, and warfarin in the
   setting of receiving quinolone and amiodarone

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   [**2200-4-10**] 6:00 PM
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1902**] came fully off of vasopressors earlier today.  However,
   This evening, Mr. [**Known lastname 1902**]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rate increased to 120s/130s.  EKG
   revealed substantial ST depressions, particularly anteriorly.  On exam,
   it appeared that, although he was quite synchronous with the
   ventilator, that he was pulling significantly negative intrathoracic
   pressure during inspiration
 as evidenced by a fall in CVP of about
   6mm Hg during early inspiration.  We therefore proceeded through a
   number of maneuvers to try to match his inspiratory demand, such as
   changing flow rates, etc.  We ended up with a pressure-cycled A/C
   mode.  With this, his swings in CVP were substantially less noticeable
   and his heart rate fell to the 100s.  His cardiogram showed some
   improvement in his ST depressions, although they persisted.  We will
   therefore gently try esmolol for better rate control.
   I discussed these issues with his wife at bedside.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old man with chronic renal and kidney disease who has developed respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly a bacterial superinfection. His respiratory status and shock have improved, but his mental status remains depressed. The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and has a history of end-stage liver disease. There is an acute component of ischemic hepatitis (shock liver) as well. The patient's coagulopathy is likely related to shock, synthetic dysfunction, and warfarin use in the setting of receiving quinolone and amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has an increased risk of developing sepsis due to his underlying chronic renal and kidney disease, influenza infection, and possible bacterial superinfection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern as he is still experiencing respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by his underlying emphysema and influenza infection.
3. Shock: The patient is at risk for recurrent shock due to his underlying conditions, including chronic renal and kidney disease, liver disease, and possible sepsis.
4. Mental status depression: The patient's mental status remains depressed, which may prevent extubation trials at present.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), which is challenging"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is currently admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis and shock.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, tachycardia, and tachypnea. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode, with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. He also has a rectal tube placed to equilibrate with atmospheric pressure due to increased abdominal distention.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing hypoxia and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and enalapril, and is currently receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, pantoprazole, and others. 

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. The heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient has increased abdominal distention, with a rectal tube placed to equilibrate with atmospheric pressure. 

The respiratory support shows that the patient is on mechanical ventilation in PCV+Assist mode with a set tidal volume of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 9 cmH2O, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The RSBI is deferred due to the patient's spontaneous breathing. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is not well-nourished, overweight/obese, with normocephalic head, endotracheal and OG tubes in place. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, but diminished pulses in both lower extremities. Respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender abdomen with hepatomegaly and cysts. Extremities show 1+ edema in both legs. Skin"

   1=[**4-7**]), last day today
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefepime x 7 days.  Today [**6-14**].
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   # Hypotension:
   Pressors weaned.
   Improved w/ rx of sepsis and diuresis (unload RV
 improve LV function)?
   W/ low BP overnighit w/ amiodarone and esmolol.
   Will convert to metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Goal EVEN today.
   # ID
   Likely influenza vs bacterial pneumonia.
   Antibiotics dosed before cultures.
   Cont antibiotics / goal 7 day course.
   # EKG changes
   ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads.
   Likely demand related w increased work of breathing and tachycardia.
   Will eval improvement w/ [**Last Name (un) 1970**] heart rate post esmolol.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and polycystic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to influenza and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode and assisted spontaneous breaths. He is also receiving sedation.

The patient has been experiencing hypoxia and has required multiple interventions to improve oxygenation. He was given an aprv maneuver to recruit alveoli and later switched to assist control ventilation (A/C) to determine if the decompensation was respiratory, cardiac, or other. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure have been unstable, and he has received esmolol for rate control and pressors for blood pressure support.

The patient's abdomen is distended, and there is concern for potential bowel ischemia. Initial attempts at decompressing the abdomen with a rectal tube were unsuccessful. Surgical consultation has been obtained, but surgical intervention is not currently possible.

The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a concern for possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HITT). All heparin products have been held, and a HITT antibody test has been sent. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, indicating improving liver function.

The patient's code status is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with chronic renal and kidney disease who is currently experiencing respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly a bacterial superinfection. His respiratory status and shock have improved, but he had an episode of tachycardia/tachypnea/ST depressions last night. He is still critically ill and requires ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying emphysema and influenza infection have led to respiratory failure. The use of mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support his breathing.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the possible bacterial superinfection. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is crucial.
3. Cardiac Issues: The patient's mental status and cardiac issues make extubation difficult at present. Close monitoring of his cardiac function is necessary.
4. Liver Disease: The patient has end-stage liver disease with an acute component of ischemic hepatitis (shock liver). Hepatology follow-up is recommended.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, likely related to shock, synthetic dysfunction, and warfarin use. Monitoring of clotting factors and appropriate management is essential.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is falling, and a possible diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) should be considered. H"

   67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   pulmonary HTN, on oseltamivir (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime (day1 = [**4-6**]),
   vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing by level).
   Hypotension: Patient hypotensive again today with sbps in the 70s, not
   resolving with small fluid boluses, patient put back in phenylephrine.
   Considering medication effect since we have been rapidly uptitrating
   her bblocker in order to control her rate before he is extubated. He
   also had an axillary temp today of 100.4, and could possibly have been
   running temps while in CVVH. A possibilty is that he is still infected,
   or has developed a temp while in the cefepime and vanc. He may still be
   septic. Considering liver abcess or infected cyst.
   - broaden antibiotic coverage to include anaerobic, possibly in his
   abdomen
 Cefepime broaded to Zosyn on [**4-12**], continue flagyl
   - CT abdomen to assess for liver abscess
   - goal CVP >13-15 givenn on PEEP
   - Restart CVVH given hypotension and getting CT scan with contrast
   - i/o goal even to slightly positive.. will need CVVH
   Respiratory failure:  ARDS [**2-8**] influenza (?secondary bacterial
   infection), pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Patients extubation
   yesterday limited by HR, currently on bolus sedation over night.
   - check RSBI in the AM, and extubate when normotensive
   - Influeza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   on vancomycin day 7 today, cefepime broadened to zosyn.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   EKG changes
   ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, improving slowly with rate
   control.  Currently back on pressors, so holding off on rate control
   with beta blocker. Goal HR currently <120. if consistently above, will
   restart amiodarone with a bolus, since he has been off of it since [**4-10**]
   Will continue to follow with more aggressive rate control once
   normotensive.
   Thrombocytopenia:  improved today to platelets 100
 79. HIT is less
   likely.
   Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis, liver disease,
   drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   HITT score this AM = 5 for pretest probability.
   Will HOLD ALL heparin products. dialysis line does not have heparin,
   but central line does.
   - f/u HITT antibody.
   - d/c vancomycin if cultures negative
   - trend platelets
   - will take out heparin coated central line if spikes fever >101.
   leave for now as platelets trending up.
   ID
   Likely influenza vs bacterial pneumonia. Liver cyst/abscess?
   Antibiotics dosed before cultures.
   Cont antibiotics, broaded to zosyn, peel back if cutlures negative,
   hypotension resolved.
   Distended abdomen
   Abdomen continues distended but stable.  Initial bladder pressure WNL
   at ~10mmgHg.
   Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   Cont follow clinically.
   -          NG tube to suction
   -          considering liver abscess, infection, on zosyn for anaerobic
   coverage. Will get CT scan to r/o, keepign in mind since he has so many
   cysts, it may be difficult to tell.
   ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site.
   Goal EVEN to positive
   - Talk to renal about restarting CVVH since hypotension has recurred
   ESLD
   C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
    - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   Afib with RVR:
   Hold currently still hypotensive. Will start amiodarone if  HR >120.
   H/o PE
   patients INR subratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic.
   - consider starting very low dose coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza, and pulmonary hypertension. He is currently in the ICU for septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, and his condition has been unstable with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, leading to the initiation of vasopressor therapy.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to sepsis, drug effect, or other factors. The possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been considered, but the HITT score suggests a lower likelihood.
3. EKG changes: The patient shows persistent ST depressions on anterior/lateral leads, possibly indicating ischemia. Rate control measures have been implemented.
4. Distended abdomen: The patient has a distended abdomen with elevated bladder pressure, but the cause is unclear. Clostridium difficile infection has been ruled out.
5. Liver cyst/abscess: There is a suspicion of a liver abscess, especially considering the presence of multiple cysts in the liver. A CT scan of the abdomen is planned"

   infection), pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Patients extubation
   yesterday limited by HR, currently on bolus sedation over night.
   - check RSBI in the AM, and likely extubate.
   - Influeza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,

   Likely demand related w increased work of breathing and tachycardia.
   Will continue to follow with more aggressive rate control.
   metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **], willl titrate up to TID
   Thrombocytopenia:
   Many potential causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and secondary bacterial infection. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, sedation, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has shown a decrease in platelet count, which could be caused by drug-induced thrombocytopenia due to antibiotics or a possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HITT). Further investigation and appropriate management are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, possibly due to sepsis and diuresis. Pressors were weaned off, and the patient's condition improved with treatment and diuretic therapy.
3. Distended abdomen: The patient's abdomen continues to be distended, and the cause is unclear. Initial bladder pressure was within normal limits, but further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires dialysis. Temporary HD catheter at the femoral site was placed, and CVVH will be stopped to resume HD.
5. ESLD: The patient has ESLD and requires"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yr old man with chronic renal and kidney disease now with
   respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly
   bacterial superinfection.  His respiratory status and shock improved
   over a few days, this AM he seems a little worse (back on pressors and
   mildly febrile)
   Shock - improved
          Sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection.
          Treated influenza.
          Had stopped Cefepime and Vanco (no source and concern for
   med related thrombocytopenia) on [**4-11**] but now mildly febrile (lines, VAP
   etc) so restarted today (pending repeat clx): RUQ appears tender will
   CT today and start Vanco and Pip-Tazo.   Will rapidly titrate off if no
   signs of infection.
          Run even today
   Respiratory failure
   With underlying emphysema and Influenza
   Mental status improved (following simple commands)
   Has been tolerating CPAP and PS. He tolerates SBT t (need adequate rate
   control, resolution of his ST changes and also to figure out if he is
   getting septic again prior to extubating)
   Afib with RVR
   Likely exacerbation in setting of sepsis.
   Seems to be slowly improving with Beta blockade (but hypotensive
   concering for new source of infection). Will probably reload with amio
   if rate becomes an issue in setting of his hypotension (sustained >
   120)
   Repeat daily ECG
   Liver reports that amiodarone is acceptable in his condition
   ESRD
   Will need to continued CVHD  in the setting of mild fevers)
   He is likely euvolemic at present
   Abdominal distention
   NG to suction
   Ask liver/GI to comment
   - rectal tube didnt seem to make a difference.
   - CT abd today for increasing pain and low grade fever. Follow up
   results.
   Liver disease
   By history, he has end-stage liver disease.  However, there is an acute
   component of ischemic hepatitis (shock liver) as well.  Hepatology is
   following.
   Coagulopathy
   -Likely related to shock, synthetic dysfunction, and warfarin in the
   setting of receiving quinolone and amiodarone
   - Hx of PE and Afib , sub therapeutic on coumadin but also with low
   Plts (actually increased to 100 today)
   ST depressions
   -  Recheck EKG.  Troponins reassuring.  Continue rate control as needed
   (challengin in setting of hypotension). Will likely go for amio if we
   need it.
   Thrombocytopenia: seems be resolving plts 100 today.  (Sepsis vs HIT vs
   sequestering in setting of liver failure).
   -          check HIT
   -          hold heparin products (although line does have heparin coat)
   -          keep antibiotics and other things in ddx.  If continues to
   fall and HIT (-), stop vanco.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old man with chronic renal and kidney disease who is now experiencing respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly a bacterial superinfection. His respiratory status and shock have improved over the past few days, but this morning he appears to be slightly worse, with the return of pressors and a mild fever. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock - improved, but the patient is back on pressors.
2. Sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection. Treated influenza. Stopped Cefepime and Vancomycin due to concern for medication-related thrombocytopenia, but restarted today pending repeat cultures.
3. Respiratory failure - with underlying emphysema and influenza. Mental status improved, tolerating CPAP and PSV. Will continue weaning off ventilator once rate control is achieved and if no signs of infection are present.
4. Mental status improved, following simple commands.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - likely exacerbation in the setting of sepsis. Slowly improving with beta blockade, but hypotensive concerning for new source of infection.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia.
7. ESRD - will need continued CVHD in the setting of mild fevers.
8. Abdominal distention - NG to suction, CT abdomen today"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yr old man with chronic renal and kidney disease now with
   respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly
   bacterial superinfection.  His respiratory status and shock improved
   over a few days, this AM he seems a little worse (back on pressors and
   mildly febrile)
   Shock - improved
          Sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection.
          Treated influenza.
          Had stopped Cefepime and Vanco (no source and concern for
   med related thrombocytopenia) on [**4-11**] but now mildly febrile (lines, VAP
   etc) so restarted today (pending repeat clx): RUQ appears tender will
   CT today and start Vanco and Pip-Tazo.   Will rapidly titrate off if no
   signs of infection.
          Run even today
   Respiratory failure
   With underlying emphysema and Influenza
   Mental status improved (following simple commands)
   Has been tolerating CPAP and PS. He tolerates SBT t (need adequate rate
   control, resolution of his ST changes and also to figure out if he is
   getting septic again prior to extubating)
   Afib with RVR
   Likely exacerbation in setting of sepsis.
   Seems to be slowly improving with Beta blockade (but hypotensive
   concering for new source of infection). Will probably reload with amio
   if rate becomes an issue in setting of his hypotension (sustained >
   120)
   Repeat daily ECG
   Liver reports that amiodarone is acceptable in his condition
   ESRD
   Will need to continued CVHD  in the setting of mild fevers)
   He is likely euvolemic at present
   Abdominal distention
   NG to suction
   Ask liver/GI to comment
   - rectal tube didnt seem to make a difference.
   - CT abd today for increasing pain and low grade fever. Follow up
   results.
   Liver disease
   By history, he has end-stage liver disease.  However, there is an acute
   component of ischemic hepatitis (shock liver) as well.  Hepatology is
   following.
   Coagulopathy
   -Likely related to shock, synthetic dysfunction, and warfarin in the
   setting of receiving quinolone and amiodarone
   - Hx of PE and Afib , sub therapeutic on coumadin but also with low
   Plts (actually increased to 100 today)
   ST depressions
   -  Recheck EKG.  Troponins reassuring.  Continue rate control as needed
   (challengin in setting of hypotension). Will likely go for amio if we
   need it.
   Thrombocytopenia: seems be resolving plts 100 today.  (Sepsis vs HIT vs
   sequestering in setting of liver failure).
   -          check HIT
   -          hold heparin products (although line does have heparin coat)
   -          keep antibiotics and other things in ddx.  If continues to
   fall and HIT (-), stop vanco.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic renal and kidney disease, respiratory failure, and shock secondary to influenza and possible bacterial superinfection. He has shown improvements in his respiratory status and shock over the past few days but appears to be worsening again, with increased beta-blocker use leading to hypotension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, sedated but responsive and interactive, and has a fever. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/61 mmHg to 91/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and positive stool culture. There is a concern for sepsis secondary to influenza and possible bacterial superinfection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying emphysema and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Shock: The patient has been in shock, which has improved but may be worsening again due to hypotension and potential new sources of infection.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to sepsis"

The patient is also being evaluated for possible new sources of infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia. He has end-stage liver disease and ischemic hepatitis (shock liver). There is a concern for coagulopathy, and the patient is on anticoagulation therapy. His platelet count is low, and he has a history of pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   pulmonary HTN, s/p oseltamivir  5 d course (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime
   (day1 = [**4-6**]-> [**4-12**])
 zosyn (day 1=[**4-12**]), vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing
   by level).
   Respiratory failure:
   ARDS [**2-8**] influenza (?secondary bacterial infection), pulmonary HTN [**2-8**]
   emphysema/COPD. Extubated yesterday.  Improved overall, will have to
   wean O2 based on diuresis from CVVH, to restart today.  No new fevers
   in 24 hrs.
   - Influeza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   on vancomycin day 8 today, cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal
   coverage, total cef/zosyn course d8 as well.  Will cont antibiotics
   given tenuous clinical state.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - CVVH- diurese w/ goal -500 to -1000 today and eval for improvement of
   resp status, wean o2 as possible.
   Hypotension
   MAPS maintained > 60 in 24 hrs.  No pressors in 24 hrs.
   Post CT abdomen, doubt new infectious etiology in abdomen.
   Sepsis (doubt) vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2^nd TTE on [**4-7**]).
   Overall improving, will cont to monitor.
   - Albumin challenge 25 g x 1 and CVVH.
   EKG changes
   ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, without marked improvement
   w/ rate control.
   Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation of
   SBP).
   Ideally will convert from IV to PO metoprolol, start low 12.5 mg PO BID
   w/ NGT placed.
   -          cont trend EKGs
   -          HR control / BP control
   Thrombocytopenia
   Cont to improve.  Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line in
   place.  However, did improve as  :  improved today to platelets 100
   79. HIT is less likely.
   Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis, liver disease,
   drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   HITT score this AM = 5 for pretest probability.
   Will HOLD ALL heparin products. dialysis line does not have heparin,
   but central line does.
   - f/u HITT antibody.
   - d/c vancomycin if cultures negative
   - trend platelets
   - will take out heparin coated central line if spikes fever >101.
   leave for now as platelets trending up.
   ID
   Likely influenza vs bacterial pneumonia. Liver cyst/abscess?
   Antibiotics dosed before cultures.
   Cont antibiotics, broaded to zosyn, peel back if cutlures negative,
   hypotension resolved.
   Distended abdomen
   Abdomen continues distended but stable.  Initial bladder pressure WNL
   at ~10mmgHg.
   Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   Cont follow clinically.
   -          NG tube to suction
   -          considering liver abscess, infection, on zosyn for anaerobic
   coverage. Will get CT scan to r/o, keepign in mind since he has so many
   cysts, it may be difficult to tell.
   ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site.
   Goal EVEN to positive
   - Talk to renal about restarting CVVH since hypotension has recurred
   ESLD
   C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
    - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   Afib with RVR:
   Hold currently still hypotensive. Will start amiodarone if  HR >120.
   H/o PE
   patients INR subratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic.
   - consider starting very low dose coumadin

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted to the ICU for severe hypoxia and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. He has undergone several interventions including invasive ventilation, hemodialysis, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concerns of secondary bacterial infection. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a high neutrophil count, indicating a possible infection.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been low, and there is a suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, the platelet count is improving, and the decision to hold all heparin products has been made.
3. Liver Abscess: The patient's CT scan shows a massively enlarged multicystic liver, which raises concerns about the presence of a liver abscess. Antibiotics have been broadened to cover anaerobic bacteria.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there are concerns about septic shock or cardiogenic shock. Pressors are being used to maintain a mean arterial"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   pulmonary HTN, s/p oseltamivir  5 d course (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime
   (day1 = [**4-6**]-> [**4-12**])
 zosyn (day 1=[**4-12**]), vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing
   by level).
   Respiratory failure:
   ARDS [**2-8**] influenza (?secondary bacterial infection), pulmonary HTN [**2-8**]
   emphysema/COPD. Extubated yesterday.  Improved overall, will have to
   wean O2 based on diuresis from CVVH, to restart today.  No new fevers
   in 24 hrs.
   - Influeza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   on vancomycin day 8 today, cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal
   coverage, total cef/zosyn course d8 as well.  Will cont antibiotics
   given tenuous clinical state.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - CVVH- diurese w/ goal -500 to -1000 today and eval for improvement of
   resp status, wean o2 as possible.
   Hypotension
   MAPS maintained > 60 in 24 hrs.  No pressors in 24 hrs.
   Post CT abdomen, doubt new infectious etiology in abdomen.
   Sepsis (doubt) vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2^nd TTE on [**4-7**]).
   Overall improving, will cont to monitor.
   - Albumin challenge 25 g x 1 and CVVH.
   EKG changes
   ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, without marked improvement
   w/ rate control.
   Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation of
   SBP).
   Ideally will convert from IV to PO metoprolol, start low 12.5 mg PO BID
   w/ NGT placed.
   -          cont trend EKGs
   -          HR control / BP control
   Thrombocytopenia
   Cont to improve.  Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line in
   place.  However, did improve as reduced heparin products.  Overall
   doubt HITT still.  Nonetheless, will hold on heparin gtts for bridge
   for PE treatment (starting coumadin though).
   Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis, liver disease,
   drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   Will HOLD ALL heparin products x for heparinized central line (opt not
   to pull w/ increasing plts).
   - f/u HITT antibody.
   - trend platelets
   ID
   Likely influenza vs bacterial pneumonia.  No CT changes for
   intra-abdominal abscess.
   Of note, antiobiotics dosed before cultures.  At 8 d of antibiotics
   currently, however given critical state will cont antibitoics.
   ? length of theray.
   Will await culture data, clinical improvement.
   Cont zosyn / vancomycin.
   Distended abdomen
   Abdomen continues distended but stable.
   Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   Cont follow clinically.
   ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site.
   Goal EVEN to positive
   - Talk to renal about restarting CVVH since hypotension has recurred
   ESLD
   C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
    - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   Afib with RVR:
   Will transition to metoprolol 12.5 po bid via NGT, priority over IV
   dosing.
   H/o PE
   patients INR subratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic.  Goal

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and required invasive ventilation. He has been on multiple antibiotics including cefepime, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected secondary bacterial infection. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, tachycardia not controlled with metoprolol, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and distended abdomen. He has been extubated and is using a high flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. His vital signs show a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

His laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, altered coagulation profile, and abnormal renal function. Imaging studies reveal a massively enlarged multicystic liver, moderate amount of complex ascites, cholelithiasis, and small bilateral pleural effusions. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, sepsis, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and other comorbidities"

   pulmonary HTN, on oseltamivir (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime (day1 = [**4-6**]),
   vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing by level).
   Hypotension: Patient hypotensive again today with sbps in the 70s, not
   resolving with small fluid boluses, patient put back in phenylephrine.
   Considering medication effect since we have been rapidly uptitrating
   her bblocker in order to control her rate before he is extubated. He
   also had an axillary temp today of 100.4, and could possibly have been
   running temps while in CVVH. A possibilty is that he is still infected,
   or has developed a temp while in the cefepime and vanc. He may still be
   septic. Considering liver abcess or infected cyst.
   - broaden antibiotic coverage to include anaerobic, possibly in his
   abdomen
 Cefepime broaded to Zosyn on [**4-12**], continue flagyl
   - CT abdomen to assess for liver abscess
   - goal CVP >13-15 givenn on PEEP
   - Restart CVVH given hypotension and getting CT scan with contrast

   Respiratory failure:  ARDS [**2-8**] influenza (?secondary bacterial
   infection), pulmonary HTN [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Patients extubation
   yesterday limited by HR, currently on bolus sedation over night.
   - check RSBI in the AM, and extubate when normotensive
   - Influeza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   on vancomycin day 7 today, cefepime broadened to zosyn.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   EKG changes
   ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, improving slowly with rate
   control.  Currently back on pressors, so holding off on rate control
   with beta blocker. Goal HR currently <120. if consistently above, will
   restart amiodarone with a bolus, since he has been off of it since [**4-10**]
   Will continue to follow with more aggressive rate control once
   normotensive.
   Thrombocytopenia:  improved today to platelets 100
 79. HIT is less
   likely.
   Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis, liver disease,
   drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   HITT score this AM = 5 for pretest probability.
   Will HOLD ALL heparin products. dialysis line does not have heparin,
   but central line does.
   - f/u HITT antibody.
   - d/c vancomycin if cultures negative
   - trend platelets
   - will take out heparin coated central line if spikes fever >101.
   leave for now as platelets trending up.

   Likely influenza vs bacterial pneumonia. Liver cyst/abscess?
   Antibiotics dosed before cultures.
   Cont antibiotics, broaded to zosyn, peel back if cutlures negative,
   hypotension resolved.

   [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   Cont follow clinically.
   -          NG tube to suction
   -          considering liver abscess, infection, on zosyn for anaerobic
   coverage. Will get CT scan to r/o, keepign in mind since he has so many
   cysts, it may be difficult to tell.
   ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site.
   Goal EVEN to positive
   - Talk to renal about restarting CVVH since hypotension has recurred
   ESLD
   C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
    - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   Afib with RVR:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has been on various medications including oseltamivir, cefepime, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He is also receiving multiple infusions such as dextrose, morphine sulfate, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate in the 90s, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 mmHg to 133/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low potassium, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile. Imaging studies reveal consolidations and effusions in the lungs.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite small fluid boluses, so he has been put back on phenyle"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   pulmonary HTN, s/p oseltamivir  5 d course (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime
   (day1 = [**4-6**]-> [**4-12**])
 zosyn (day 1=[**4-12**]), vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing
   by level).
   Respiratory failure:
   ARDS [**2-8**] influenza (?secondary bacterial infection), pulmonary HTN [**2-8**]
   emphysema/COPD. Extubated yesterday.  Improved overall, will have to
   wean O2 based on diuresis from CVVH, to restart today.  No new fevers
   in 24 hrs.
   - Influeza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   on vancomycin day 8 today, cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal
   coverage, total cef/zosyn course d8 as well.  Will cont antibiotics
   given tenuous clinical state.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - CVVH- diurese w/ goal -500 to -1000 today and eval for improvement of
   resp status, wean o2 as possible.
   Hypotension
   MAPS maintained > 60 in 24 hrs.  No pressors in 24 hrs.
   Post CT abdomen, doubt new infectious etiology in abdomen.
   Sepsis (doubt) vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2^nd TTE on [**4-7**]).
   Overall improving, will cont to monitor.
   - Albumin challenge 25 g x 1 and CVVH.
   EKG changes
   ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, without marked improvement
   w/ rate control.
   Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation of
   SBP).
   Ideally will convert from IV to PO metoprolol, start low 12.5 mg PO BID
   w/ NGT placed.
   -          cont trend EKGs
   -          HR control / BP control
   Thrombocytopenia
   Cont to improve.  Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line in
   place.  However, did improve as  :  improved today to platelets 100
   79. HIT is less likely.
   Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis, liver disease,
   drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   HITT score this AM = 5 for pretest probability.
   Will HOLD ALL heparin products. dialysis line does not have heparin,
   but central line does.
   - f/u HITT antibody.
   - d/c vancomycin if cultures negative
   - trend platelets
   - will take out heparin coated central line if spikes fever >101.
   leave for now as platelets trending up.
   ID
   Likely influenza vs bacterial pneumonia. Liver cyst/abscess?
   Antibiotics dosed before cultures.
   Cont antibiotics, broaded to zosyn, peel back if cutlures negative,
   hypotension resolved.
   Distended abdomen
   Abdomen continues distended but stable.  Initial bladder pressure WNL
   at ~10mmgHg.
   Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   Cont follow clinically.
   -          NG tube to suction
   -          considering liver abscess, infection, on zosyn for anaerobic
   coverage. Will get CT scan to r/o, keepign in mind since he has so many
   cysts, it may be difficult to tell.
   ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site.
   Goal EVEN to positive
   - Talk to renal about restarting CVVH since hypotension has recurred
   ESLD
   C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
    - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   Afib with RVR:
   Hold currently still hypotensive. Will start amiodarone if  HR >120.
   H/o PE
   patients INR subratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic.
   - consider starting very low dose coumadin

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yr old man with chronic renal and kidney disease now with
   respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly
   bacterial superinfection.  His respiratory status and shock improved
   over a few days, [**4-12**] febrile but no clear source. Extubated yesterday
   to face mask, looks tenuous at present
   Shock - improved
          Sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection.
          Treated influenza. Repeated the aspirate in the setting of
   fever yesterday (still pending)
          Had stopped Cefepime and Vanco (no source and concern for
   med related thrombocytopenia) on [**4-11**] but now mildly febrile (lines, VAP
   etc) so restarted ABx (pending repeat clx): RUQ appears CT not
   impressive for infection, Will cont Vanco and Pip-Tazo.   Will rapidly
   titrate off if no signs of infection (clx still pending at present).
   Reconsider our coverage on monday if stable and all clx neg
   Respiratory failure: no extubated, but quite weak. supportuve pulm

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with chronic renal and kidney disease who is now experiencing respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly a bacterial superinfection. His respiratory status and shock have improved over the past few days. He was extubated yesterday but appears tenuous at present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection: The patient's fever, along with an improvement in respiratory status and shock, suggests an ongoing infection. Antibiotics have been restarted due to the presence of fever.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Signs of infection in the lower respiratory tract should be closely monitored.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has a history of end-stage liver disease and is showing signs of acute ischemic hepatitis (shock liver). Liver function tests are trending down, and hepatology is following the case.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is likely compromised due to shock, synthetic dysfunction, and warfarin use. The platelet count has improved, and warfarin therapy will be restarted while monitoring for bleeding complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially had low platelet counts, which seem to be resolving. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including checking for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of chronic renal and kidney disease who is now experiencing respiratory failure and shock secondary to influenza and possibly bacterial superinfection. His respiratory status and shock have improved over a few days, but he remains febrile without a clear source. He was extubated yesterday but looks tenuous at present. The patient is also dealing with sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection. Treatment for influenza has been administered, and antibiotics have been restarted due to his recent fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is complicated by underlying emphysema and flu. He is not extubated and appears weak, making supportive pulmonary toileting essential. 
2. Shock: The patient's shock is improving but remains a concern, especially in the setting of potential new sources of infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to influenza +/- secondary bacterial infection. He has been treated for influenza, and antibiotics have been restarted due to his recent fever.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be related to sepsis, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or sequestration in liver failure. Further investigation and management are required.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has end-stage liver disease with an acute component of ischemic hepatitis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post bilateral nephrectomy, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was previously intubated but has been extubated and is now on high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for respiratory support. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/53 to 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on HFNC. 

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been managed with volume optimization through continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). CVVH was held due to clotting but has been restarted. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 5.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 33.2%, low platelet count (Plt) of 119 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 3.1 to 3.6 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels. 

The patient's EKG shows ST depressions on anterior/lateral leads without marked improvement"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is being treated with various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, diuretics, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to fluid shifts from continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) or sepsis. Close monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) is necessary, and pressors may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Secondary Bacterial Infection: The patient's ARDS may have led to a secondary bacterial infection, for which he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Close monitoring of sputum culture results and chest X-rays is essential to guide treatment.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which could be due to multiple factors such as sepsis, drug effects, or liver disease. Monitoring of platelet levels and trend is important, and the use of heparin products should be carefully evaluated.
4. Distended Abdomen: The patient's distended abdomen may be caused by various factors such"

   pulmonary HTN, with continued respiratory failure
    #Respiratory failure:
   - ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Extubated [**4-12**].  Improved overall, will have to wean
   O2 based on diuresis from CVVH, to restart today.  No new fevers in 24
   hrs (low grade at 99)
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal coverage.  Will cont
   antibiotics (vanc/zosyn) given tenuous clinical state for total of 5
   days since restart (today is day 3) as no clear evidence of current pna
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - CVVH-held yesterday due to hypotension. Goal I/O even to -500 and
   eval for improvement of resp status, wean o2 as possible.
   - Can add pressors if necessary for diuresis with CVVH given concern
   for the need to reintubated [**2-8**] volume overload
   - Continue to follow cultures, all bcx NGTD
   - Will follow with ID regarding discontinuing droplet precautions
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH.
   - MAP goal > 60, was decreased overnight, though no need for pressors
   for 48 hours.
   - Post CT abdomen, doubt new infectious etiology in abdomen.
   - Sepsis (doubt) vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2nd TTE on [**4-7**]).
   - Overall improving, will cont to monitor.
   - Albumin challenge 25 g x 1 and CVVH overnight, will given additional
   albumin with CVVH today given modest improvement.
   #EKG changes
   - ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, with moderate improvement
   w/ rate control.
   - Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation
   of SBP).
   - Started on PO metoprolol, start low 12.5 mg PO BID w/ NGT placed
   (holding parameters in place).  Unable to titrate up due to BP, but has
   had controlled heart rate on current regimen.
   - Cont trend EKGs
   - HR control / BP control
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Cont to improve.  Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line
   in place.  However, did improve as reduced heparin products.  Overall
   doubt HIT still.  Nonetheless, will hold on heparin gtts for bridge for
   PE treatment (starting coumadin though).
   - Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis/DIC, liver
   disease with sequestration, drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   - Will HOLD ALL heparin products except for heparinized central line
   (opt not to pull w/ increasing plts).
   - f/u HIT antibody.
   - trend platelets, continuing to improve slowly
   #Distended abdomen
   - Abdomen continues distended but stable.
   - Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far x3.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   - Cont follow clinically.
   #ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy

   - Goal EVEN to negative 500cc given resp distress overnight, gentle
   diuresis in the setting of hypotension during CVVH
   - Will discuss with renal
   #ESLD
   - C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
   - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with ESLD/ESRD and a history of polycystic kidney disease, ARDS due to influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and emphysema/COPD. The patient was admitted with hypoxia and has been in the ICU since [**2200-4-6**]. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/53 mmHg to 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals white patches on the tongue, difficulty auscultating lung sounds, coarse breath sounds with poor air movement, upper airway congestion, a distended abdomen that is dull to percussion on the right side, and multiple AV fistulas on the left arm.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures are negative for Clostridium difficile and DFA A positive.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure:
   - ARDS due to influenza with potential secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary hypertension.

   Extubated on [**4-12**] and tolerating shovel mask
   - ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Extubated [**4-12**].  Improved overall, will need to wean
   O2 based on diuresis from CVVH, restarted yesterday.  No new fevers in
   24 hrs (low grade at 99)
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of

   cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal coverage.  Will cont
   antibiotics (vanc/zosyn) given tenuous clinical state for total of 5
   days since restart (today is day 4) as no definitive evidence of pna at

   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - CVVH-restarted yesterday, patient developed hypotension with MAPs in
   the 50s requiring neo gtt, not able to be weaned as at goal MAP of 60.
    Will continue CVVH with pressors as diuresis necessary to avoid
   reintubation [**2-8**] volume overload.
   - Continue to follow cultures, all bcx NGTD
   - Will follow with ID regarding discontinuing droplet precautions
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH.
   - MAP goal > 60, currently on neo at 1mcg/kg/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] attempt to wean

   - On PO metoprolol, start low 12.5 mg PO BID w/ NGT placed (holding
   parameters in place).  Unable to titrate up due to BP, but has had
   controlled heart rate on current regimen.
   - Cont trend EKGs
   - HR control / BP control
   - Can consider repeat ECHO to reevaluate RV for prognosis as well as to
   guid management with CVVH and pressors
   # Leukocytosis:
   Significantly increased WBC today. Patient has been afebrile and
   clinically improved other than hypotension during CVVH.
   - Will recheck, continue to monitor.
   - Culture if spikes.
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Cont to improve.  Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line

   pulmonary HTN, with continued respiratory failure.
    #Respiratory failure:
   Extubated on [**4-12**] and tolerating shovel mask
   - ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Extubated [**4-12**].  Improved overall, will need to wean
   O2 based on diuresis from CVVH, restarted yesterday.  No new fevers in
   24 hrs (low grade at 99)
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal coverage.  New leukocytosis
   today, concern for evolving sepsis.  Will cont antibiotics (vanc/zosyn)
   and add Cipro for double pseudomonal coverage.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   - CVVH-restarted yesterday, patient developed hypotension with MAPs in
   the 50s requiring neo gtt, not able to be weaned as at goal MAP of 60.
   Given concern for new infection, HD line to be pulled today (CVP of 2
   so not likely intravascularly volume overloaded at this time). Will
   reassess need for CVVH tomorrow based on resp status and blood
   pressure.
   - Continue to follow cultures, all bcx NGTD
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH. Though concern for evolving
   infection.
   - MAP goal > 60, currently on neo at 1mcg/kg/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Sepsis vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2nd TTE on [**4-7**].  Will get
   repeat ECHO today, see below.
   - Albumin challenge 25 g x 1 and CVVH yesterday
   #EKG changes
   - ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, with moderate improvement
   w/ rate control.
   - Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation
   of SBP).
   - On PO metoprolol, start low 12.5 mg PO BID w/ NGT placed (holding
   parameters in place).  Unable to titrate up due to BP, but has had
   controlled heart rate on current regimen.
   - Cont trend EKGs
   - HR control / BP control
   - Repeat ECHO to reevaluate RV for prognosis as well as to guide
   management with CVVH and pressors
   # Leukocytosis:
   Significantly increased WBC today. Patient has been afebrile and
   clinically improved other than hypotension during CVVH.
   - Will recheck, continue to monitor.
   - Culture if spikes.
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Cont to improve.  Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line
   in place.  However, did improve as reduced heparin products.  Overall
   doubt HIT still.  Nonetheless, will hold on heparin gtts for bridge for
   PE treatment (starting coumadin though).
   - Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis/DIC, liver
   disease with sequestration, drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   - Will HOLD ALL heparin products except for heparinized central line
   (opt not to pull w/ increasing plts).
   - f/u HIT antibody.
   - trend platelets, continuing to improve slowly
   #Distended abdomen
   - Abdomen continues distended but stable.
   - Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far x3.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   - Cont follow clinically.
   #ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   - On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site.
   - Goal EVEN to negative 500cc, gentle diuresis in the setting of
   hypotension during CVVH, requiring pressors as above
   - Continue to follow with renal.
    #ESLD
   - C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
   - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   #Afib with RVR:
   - On PO meoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] via NGT
   #H/o PE
   - patients INR supratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic.
   Goal [**2-9**].
   - Coumadin 5mg daily, no heparin as above.  Will continue current dose
   as will likely increase over next several days, especially with
   addition of Cipro
   - Home dose 4mg QOD 5 mg QOD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and polycystic kidney disease. He is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza, pulmonary hypertension, and continued respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and tolerating a shovel mask, but still requires supplemental oxygen. He has a history of emphysema/COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS has resulted in respiratory failure, which is currently being managed with supplemental oxygen and non-invasive ventilation. Close monitoring and weaning of oxygen support will be necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and is at risk for sepsis, especially with the presence of consolidations and effusions on CT lung, negative sputum culture, and broad-spectrum antibiotics already given. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and adjustment of antibiotic therapy will be crucial.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to fluid shifts from continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). It is essential to maintain a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 and carefully titrate vasoactive medications to achieve adequate blood pressure without causing excessive fluid overload.

4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's recent"

   67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   s/p oseltamivir  5 d course (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime (day1 = [**4-6**]->
   [**4-12**]), zosyn (day 1=[**4-12**]), vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing by level),
   pulmonary HTN, with continued respiratory failure.
    #Respiratory failure:
   Extubated on [**4-12**] and tolerating shovel mask
   - ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Extubated [**4-12**].  Improved overall, will need to wean
   O2 based on diuresis from CVVH, restarted yesterday.  No new fevers in
   24 hrs (low grade at 99)
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal coverage.  New leukocytosis
   with bands today, concern for evolving sepsis.  Will cont antibiotics
   (vanc/zosyn) and add Cipro for double pseudomonal coverage.
   - CVVH-restarted yesterday, patient developed hypotension with MAPs in
   the 50s requiring neo gtt, not able to be weaned as at goal MAP of 60.
   Given concern for new infection, HD line to be pulled today (CVP of 2
   so not likely intravascularly volume overloaded at this time). Will
   reassess need for CVVH tomorrow based on resp status and blood
   pressure.
   - Continue to follow cultures, all bcx NGTD
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   # ID/Leukocytosis with bandemia:
   Significantly increased WBC today.  Platelets also increased likely as
   well likely as acute phase reactant.  Patient has been afebrile and
   clinically improved other than hypotension during CVVH.
   - HD and RIJ lines pull today, send for culture, will resite IJ
   - Add cipro for double pseudomonal coverage
   - Recheck sputum
   - Panculture now including mycolytic cultures as patient unlikely to
   spike in the setting of CVVH
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH. Though concern for evolving
   infection.
   - MAP goal > 60, currently on neo, will attempt to wean as tolerated.
   Now off CVVH.
   - Sepsis vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2nd TTE on [**4-7**].  Will get
   repeat ECHO today, see below.
   - Albumin challenge 25 g x 1 and CVVH yesterday
   #EKG changes
   - ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, with moderate improvement
   w/ rate control.
   - Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation
   of SBP).
   - PO metop dc
d today given hypotension and pressors.  Heart rate still
   controlled, amio if returns to RVR
   - Cont trend EKGs
   - HR control / BP control
   - Repeat ECHO to reevaluate RV for prognosis as well as to guide
   management with CVVH and pressors
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Improved today, though likely a result of infection/acute phase
   reactant.
   - Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line in place.  However,
   did improve as reduced heparin products.  Overall doubt HIT still.
   Nonetheless, will hold on heparin gtts for bridge for PE treatment
   (starting coumadin though).
   - Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis/DIC, liver
   disease with sequestration, drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   - Will continue to hold all heparin products except for heparinized
   central lines
   - f/u HIT antibody.
   - Continue to trend
   #Distended abdomen
   - Abdomen continues distended but stable.
   - Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far x3.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   - Cont follow clinically.
   #ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   - On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site.
   - Goal EVEN to negative 500cc, gentle diuresis in the setting of
   hypotension during CVVH, requiring pressors as above
   - Continue to follow with renal.
    #ESLD
   - C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
   - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   #Afib with RVR:
   - On PO meoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] via NGT, dc
d in the setting of hypotension
   and pressors.
   - If patient has repeat RVR, can load with amiodarone as beta blockade
   will lead to further reduction in SBP.
   #H/o PE
   - patients INR supratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic.
   Goal [**2-9**].
   - Coumadin 5mg daily, no heparin as above.  Will continue current dose
   as will likely increase over next several days, especially with
   addition of Cipro
   - Home dose 4mg QOD 5 mg QOD.

   respiratory failure and new evolving infection.
   #Respiratory failure:
   Extubated on [**4-12**] and tolerating shovel mask
   - ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Extubated [**4-12**].  Improved overall, will need to wean
   O2 based on diuresis from CVVH.  HD catheter removed yesterday so no
   CVVH overnight. Will likely require new line today for fluid removal.
   Patient has been afebrile.
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal coverage.  New leukocytosis
   with bands today, concern for evolving sepsis.  Will cont antibiotics
   (vanc/zosyn) and add Cipro for double pseudomonal coverage.
   - Continue to follow cultures, all bcx NGTD
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   # ID/Leukocytosis with bandemia:
   WBC significantly increased yesterday, slightly decreased today, but
   still with bandemia.  Patient has been afebrile and clinically improved
   other than hypotension during CVVH.
   - HD line pulled yesterday. Plan to pull RIJ today and send for culture
   -Cipro added for double pseudomonal coverage
   - Pancultured yesterday, will follow results
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH. Though concern for evolving
   infection.
   - MAP goal > 60, still on neo, will attempt to wean as tolerated. Now
   off CVVH.
   - Sepsis vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2nd TTE on [**4-7**].
   - Repeat ECHO yesterday, awaiting read
   #EKG changes
   - ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, with moderate improvement
   w/ rate control.
   - Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation
   of SBP).
   - PO metop dc
d given hypotension and pressors.  Heart rate still
   controlled, amio if returns to RVR
   - Cont trend EKGs
   - HR control / BP control
   - Follow ECHO as above to evaluate RV for prognosis as well as to guide
   management with CVVH and pressors
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Improved, though likely a result of infection/acute phase reactant.
   - Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line in place.  However,
   did improve as reduced heparin products.  Overall doubt HIT still.
   Nonetheless, will hold on heparin gtts for bridge for PE treatment
   (starting coumadin though).
   - Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis/DIC, liver
   disease with sequestration, drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   - Will continue to hold all heparin products except for heparinized
   central lines
   - f/u HIT antibody.
   - Continue to trend
   #Distended abdomen
   - Abdomen continues distended but stable.
   - Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far x3.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   - Cont follow clinically.
   #ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   - On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site removed
   yesterday.
   - Patient with volume overload today, goal even to negative 500cc,
   gentle diuresis in the setting of hypotension during CVVH, requiring
   pressors as above
   - Continue to follow with renal, will likely require CVVH today as he
   is anuric.
    #ESLD
   - C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
   - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   #Afib with RVR:
   - On PO meoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] via NGT, dc
d in the setting of hypotension
   and pressors.
   - If patient has repeat RVR, can load with amiodarone as beta blockade
   will lead to further reduction in SBP.
   #H/o PE
   - patients INR supratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic,
   near goal [**2-9**].
   - Coumadin 5mg daily, no heparin as above.  Will continue current dose
   as will likely increase over next several days, especially with

   67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   s/p oseltamivir  5 d course (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime (day1 = [**4-6**]->
   [**4-12**]), zosyn (day 1=[**4-12**]), vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing by level), now
   on cipro as well (day 1=[**4-15**]) and pulmonary HTN, with continued
   respiratory failure and new evolving infection.
   #Respiratory failure:
   Extubated on [**4-12**] and tolerating shovel mask
   - ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Extubated [**4-12**].  Improved overall, will need to wean
   O2 based on diuresis from CVVH.  HD catheter removed yesterday so no
   CVVH overnight. Will likely require new line today for fluid removal.
   Patient has been afebrile (99.9).
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given (1) CT lung findings of
   consolidations and effusions, (2) sputum negative but after abx given,
   cefepime broadened to zosyn for abdominal coverage.  New leukocytosis
   with bands, concern for evolving sepsis.  Will cont antibiotics
   (vanc/zosyn) and Cipro added yesterday for double pseudomonal coverage.
   - Continue to follow cultures, all bcx NGTD
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   # ID/Leukocytosis with bandemia:
   WBC significantly increased yesterday, slightly decreased today, but
   still with bandemia.  Patient has been afebrile and clinically improved
   other than hypotension during CVVH.
   - HD line pulled yesterday. Plan to pull RIJ today and send for culture
   if patient can tolerate resiting.
   -Cipro added for double pseudomonal coverage
   - Pancultured yesterday, will follow results
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH. Though concern for evolving
   infection.
   - MAP goal > 60, still on neo, will attempt to wean as tolerated. Now
   off CVVH.
   - Sepsis vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2nd TTE on [**4-7**].
   - Repeat ECHO yesterday, awaiting read
   #EKG changes
   - ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, with moderate improvement
   w/ rate control.
   - Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation
   of SBP).
   - PO metop dc
d given hypotension and pressors.  Heart rate still
   controlled, amio if returns to RVR
   - Cont trend EKGs
   - HR control / BP control
   - Follow ECHO as above to evaluate RV for prognosis as well as to guide
   management with CVVH and pressors
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Improved, though likely a result of infection/acute phase reactant.
   - Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line in place.  However,
   did improve as reduced heparin products.  Overall doubt HIT still.
   Nonetheless, will hold on heparin gtts for bridge for PE treatment
   (starting coumadin though).
   - Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis/DIC, liver
   disease with sequestration, drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   - Will continue to hold all heparin products except for heparinized
   central lines
   - f/u HIT antibody.
   - Continue to trend
   #Distended abdomen
   - Abdomen continues to be distended but stable.
   - Unclear cause.  C diff negative so far x3.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   - Cont follow clinically.
   #ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   - On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site removed
   yesterday.
   - Patient with volume overload today, goal even to negative 500cc,
   gentle diuresis in the setting of hypotension during CVVH, requiring
   pressors as above
   - Continue to follow with renal, will likely require CVVH today as he
   is anuric.
    #ESLD
   - C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
   - LFTs trending down; maintain MAPs>60
   #Afib with RVR:
   - On PO metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] via NGT, dc
d in the setting of hypotension
   and pressors.
   - If patient has repeat RVR, can load with amiodarone as beta blockade
   will lead to further reduction in SBP.
   #H/o PE
   - patients INR supratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic,
   near goal [**2-9**].
   - Coumadin 5mg daily, no heparin as above.  Will continue current dose
   as will likely increase over next several days, especially with
   addition of Cipro
   - Home dose 4mg QOD 5 mg QOD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), polycystic kidney disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has developed pulmonary hypertension. The patient's condition is complicated by an evolving infection, sepsis, leukocytosis with bandemia, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, distended abdomen, and fluid overload. The patient requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to anuria and has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of an evolving infection, indicated by leukocytosis with bandemia and hypotension. Sepsis can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and potentially death.
2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to influenza. ARDS can progress to respiratory failure, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and increasing the risk of mortality.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen due to hypoxia and the underlying lung disease. This can lead to right ventricular strain and potentially right ventricular failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if invasive procedures are required.
5. Distended Abdom"

   #Respiratory failure:
   ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Extubated [**4-12**] and tolerating shovel mask.
   Respiratory status is stable, but unable to further wean oxygen.  HD
   catheter removed yesterday so no CVVH overnight.  Patient has been
   afebrile (99.9).
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given evolving leukocytosis with
   bands, concerning for evolving sepsis.    Will cont antibiotics

   - Continue to follow cultures, all bcx NGTD
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
   # ID/Leukocytosis with bandemia:
   WBC significantly increased yesterday, slightly decreased today, but
   still with bandemia.  Patient has been afebrile and clinically stable
   although has developed hypotension during CVVH, unable to wean
   pressors.
   - HD line pulled yesterday. Initial plan to pull RIJ, though patient
   will not likely tolerated procedure of resiting.
    -Cipro added for double pseudomonal coverage
   - Pancultured yesterday, will follow results
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH. Though concern for evolving
   infection.  TTE read pending, but history of RV dysfunction on prior
   ECHO.
   - MAP goal > 60, still on neo, will attempt to wean as tolerated. Now
   off CVVH.
   - Sepsis vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2nd TTE on [**4-7**].
   - Repeat ECHO yesterday, awaiting read
   #EKG changes
   - ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, with moderate improvement
   w/ rate control.
   - Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation
   of SBP).
   - PO metop dc
d given hypotension and pressors.  Heart rate still
   controlled, amio if returns to RVR
   - Cont trend EKGs
   - HR control / BP control
   - Follow ECHO as above to evaluate RV for prognosis as well as to guide
   management with CVVH and pressors
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Improved, though likely a result of infection/acute phase reactant.
   - Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line in place.  However,
   did improve as reduced heparin products.  Overall doubt HIT still.
   Nonetheless, will hold on heparin gtts for bridge for PE treatment
   (starting coumadin though).
   - Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis/DIC, liver
   disease with sequestration, drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   - Will continue to hold all heparin products except for heparinized
   central lines
   - f/u HIT antibody.
   - Continue to trend
   #Distended abdomen
   - Abdomen continues to be distended but stable.
   - Unclear cause.  C diff negative x3.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   - Cont follow clinically.
   #ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   - On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site removed
   yesterday.
   - Patient with volume overload today, though he is anuric, and no HD
   today given line was pulled.
    - Continue to follow with renal
    #ESLD
   - C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
   - LFTs trending down; check QOD. Maintain MAPs>60
   #Afib with RVR:
   - Metoprolol dc
d in the setting of hypotension and pressors.
   - If patient has repeat RVR, can load with amiodarone as beta blockade
   will lead to further reduction in SBP.
   #H/o PE
   - patients INR supratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic,
   near goal [**2-9**].
   - Coumadin 5mg daily, no heparin as above.  Will continue current dose
   as will likely increase over next several days, especially with
   addition of Cipro
   - Home dose 4mg QOD 5 mg QOD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), polycystic kidney disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and influenza. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been experiencing evolving leukocytosis with bands, indicating a possible secondary bacterial infection. He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and unable to wean off pressors. His abdominal distension is unexplained, and he has a history of shock liver with improving liver function tests. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and is being managed with rate control medications. He also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is on Coumadin for anticoagulation. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's evolving leukocytosis with bands, along with the presence of a secondary bacterial infection, puts him at risk for developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and pulmonary hypertension continue to impact his respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
    67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   s/p oseltamivir  5 d course (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime (day1 = [**4-6**]->
   [**4-12**]), zosyn (day 1=[**4-12**]), vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing by level), now
   on cipro as well (day 1=[**4-15**]) and pulmonary HTN, with continued
   respiratory failure and new evolving infection.  Patient is now DNR/DNI
   with plan for comfort measures later today.
   #Respiratory failure:
   ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD.  Respiratory status is stable, but unable to
   further wean oxygen.  HD catheter removed, no further CVVH so will
   continue to reaccumulate fluid.
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given evolving leukocytosis with
   bands, concerning for evolving sepsis.    Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro with
   little improvement.  As below, will dc antibiotics today.
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
    # ID/Leukocytosis with bandemia:
   WBC still increased with bandemia.  Had been on broad coverage
   antibiotics with no obvious source of infection. HD cath pulled, IJ
   still in place over concern that patient would not tolerate resiting.
   - Patient is currently comfortable and desiring to go home. Plan to
   transition to CMO today. Will dc antibiotics as he is no longer on HD
   and will not likely contribute to his overall level of comfort (and
   provides significant volume).
   - Will follow cultures
   - Wean pressors if able as below, though this is not likely.
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH c/b evolving infection and
   cardiac dysfunction.  TTE showing severe RV dysfunction as below.
   - MAP goal > 60, still on neo, unable to wean. Patient desires to
   return home, but unable to tolerate pressor wean.
   - Now off CVVH with overall volume overload.
   #EKG changes: Stable, no further changes.
   - Had ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, with moderate
   improvement w/ rate control.
   - Dc
d lopressor given hypotension and pressors.  Heart rate still
   controlled.
   - TTE showing severe and unchanged RV dysfunction which is very poor
   prognostic sign.
   - No further treatment as plan for comfort care per patient and family
   #Thrombocytopenia: Stable
   - Improved, though likely a result of infection/acute phase reactant.
   - HIT ab still pending, though unlikely HIT.
   #Distended abdomen: Stable. Following clinically, though patient denies
   pain.
   #ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   - Patient is anuric. HD cath removed given concern for evolving
   infection. No further HD patient on current goals of care.
   #ESLD
   - Stable. C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving. Maintaining MAPs>60 on
   pressors for now.
   #Afib with RVR:
   - Metoprolol dc
d in the setting of hypotension and pressors.
   - Has been rate controlled, no further intervention given clinical
   status and goal of comfort care
   #H/o PE
   - patients INR supratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic,
   near goal [**2-9**].
   -Given transition to comfort measures, will dc coumadin
   # Dispo: Will discontinue all non-necessary medications as above unless
   contributing to his overall comfort level. Will discuss possibility of
   returning home (on pressors) with palliative care today. Continued
   discussions with palliative care and family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). He has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza and pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including oseltamivir, cefepime, zosyn, and cipro, with little improvement. He is now DNR/DNI and on comfort measures. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure, evolving infection, and severe right ventricular dysfunction. There are several potential medical complications that can arise, including sepsis, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, distended abdomen, ESRD, ESLD, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and history of pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis with bandemia, indicating an evolving infection. Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is no obvious source of infection identified. This suggests a possible secondary bacterial infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension despite being on pressors. This may be secondary to fluid shifts from continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and evolving infection, as well as cardiac dysfunction. Maint"

   Assessment and Plan
    67M h/o ESLD/ESRD [**2-8**] polycystic kidney disease, ARDS [**2-8**] influenza,
   s/p oseltamivir  5 d course (day1 = [**4-6**]), cefepime (day1 = [**4-6**]->
   [**4-12**]), zosyn (day 1=[**4-12**]), vancomycin (day1 = [**4-6**], dosing by level), now
   on cipro as well (day 1=[**4-15**]) and pulmonary HTN, with continued
   respiratory failure and new evolving infection.
   #Respiratory failure:
   ARDS [**2-8**] influenza with ?secondary bacterial infection, pulmonary HTN
   [**2-8**] emphysema/COPD. Extubated [**4-12**] and tolerating shovel mask.
   Respiratory status is stable, but unable to further wean oxygen.  HD
   catheter removed yesterday so no CVVH overnight.  Patient has been
   afebrile (99.9).
   - Influenza A: s/p 5 days Oseltamivir 75mg
   - ?Secondary bacterial infection: Given evolving leukocytosis with
   bands, concerning for evolving sepsis.    Will cont antibiotics
   (vanc/zosyn) and Cipro added yesterday for double pseudomonal coverage.
   - Continue to follow cultures, all bcx NGTD
   - Supportive care: Nebs, suction, chest PT
    # ID/Leukocytosis with bandemia:
   WBC significantly increased yesterday, slightly decreased today, but
   still with bandemia.  Patient has been afebrile and clinically stable
   although has developed hypotension during CVVH, unable to wean
   pressors.
   - HD line pulled yesterday. Initial plan to pull RIJ, though patient
   will not likely tolerated procedure of resiting.
   --Cipro added for double pseudomonal coverage
   - Pancultured yesterday, will follow results
   #Hypotension
   Likely secondary to fluid shifts from CVVH. Though concern for evolving
   infection.  TTE read pending, but history of RV dysfunction on prior
   ECHO.
   - MAP goal > 60, still on neo, will attempt to wean as tolerated. Now
   off CVVH.
   - Sepsis vs cardiogenic- RV dilated on 2nd TTE on [**4-7**].
   - Repeat ECHO yesterday, awaiting read
   #EKG changes
   - ST depressions on anterior / lateral leads, with moderate improvement
   w/ rate control.
   - Will cont optimize medical regimen, w/ goal HR 80s (given limitation
   of SBP).
   - PO metop dc
d given hypotension and pressors.  Heart rate still
   controlled, amio if returns to RVR
   - Cont trend EKGs
   - HR control / BP control
   - Follow ECHO as above to evaluate RV for prognosis as well as to guide
   management with CVVH and pressors
   #Thrombocytopenia
   - Improved, though likely a result of infection/acute phase reactant.
   - Doubt heparin since still has heparin coated line in place.  However,
   did improve as reduced heparin products.  Overall doubt HIT still.
   Nonetheless, will hold on heparin gtts for bridge for PE treatment
   (starting coumadin though).
   - Many potential causes including acute illness, sepsis/DIC, liver
   disease with sequestration, drug effect (vanco? Ppi?)
   - Will continue to hold all heparin products except for heparinized
   central lines
   - f/u HIT antibody.
   - Continue to trend
   #Distended abdomen
   - Abdomen continues to be distended but stable.
   - Unclear cause.  C diff negative x3.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] have mucus production in pouch w/ dilation.  Rectal tube no
   improvement.  Surgery reports cannot correct surgically now.
   - Cont follow clinically.
   #ESRD: s/p bilateral nephrectomy
   - On outpatient HD.  Temporary HD catheter at femoral site removed
   yesterday.
   - Patient with volume overload today, though he is anuric, and no HD
   today given line was pulled.
    - Continue to follow with renal
   #ESLD
   - C/b shock liver.  LFTs improving.  Cont to trend.
   - LFTs trending down; check QOD. Maintain MAPs>60
   #Afib with RVR:
   - Metoprolol dc
d in the setting of hypotension and pressors.
   - If patient has repeat RVR, can load with amiodarone as beta blockade
   will lead to further reduction in SBP.
   #H/o PE
   - patients INR supratherapeutic on admission, now subtherapateutic,
   near goal [**2-9**].
   - Coumadin 5mg daily, no heparin as above.  Will continue current dose
   as will likely increase over next several days, especially with
   addition of Cipro
   - Home dose 4mg QOD 5 mg QOD.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and pressor support.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 44/98 mmHg to 141/135 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool delivery device. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient has been making progress in terms of respiratory support, but still requires supplemental oxygen. The physical examination shows poor air movement and upper airway congestion. The abdomen is distended and non-compressible on the right side. Extremities show pneumoboots.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with bands, elevated lactate levels, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and liver enzyme abnormalities. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including oseltamivir, cefepime, zosyn, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.
