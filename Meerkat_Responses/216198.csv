   had conjunctivitits which could indicate a viral or bacterial infection
   in past couple of weeks. Lives at home but does attend a day care 3
   times a week so should cover for health care associated PNA. Patient
   required intubation for tachypnea, increased work of breathing with
   accessory muscle use and AMS (increased aggitation and subsequent
   somnolence.) CHF is also possible but appeared clinically dry with h/o
   RV hypokinesis but no left heart failure. PE is of course on
   differential but clinical picture much more c/w COPD flare, no
   significant risks for PE and no signs of right heart strain on EKG.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD who was admitted with respiratory distress and AMS. He required intubation due to increased work of breathing and tachypnea. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a ventilation strategy of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. His vital signs include a heart rate of 45 bpm, blood pressure of 105/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and hospital-acquired infection prevention. He also received aspirin for primary prevention of ACS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this complication, such as elevating the head of the bed, performing frequent hand hygiene, and ensuring proper secretion management.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility due to mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or pharmacological prophylaxis, should be considered.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, which may be due to factors such as sepsis or the use of propofol. Close monitoring"

","The patient's medical history includes acute respiratory failure and hypotension. They were admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and were intubated. Propofol was initially used for sedation, but had to be stopped due to hypotension. The patient then received versed/fentanyl, resulting in bradycardia. Propofol was restarted, and the bradycardia persisted even after stopping propofol again. The patient is currently on propofol and is still bradycardic but following commands.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 45 bpm (with a range of 40-94 bpm), blood pressure of 105/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (with a range of 18-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, glucose of 159 mg/dL, sodium of 116 mEq/L, potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, chloride of 27 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 42.2%, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 24 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T of <0.01 ng/mL, and lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has a total fluid intake of 7,488 mL and output of 2,038 mL, with a urine output of 280 mL and blood product transfusion of 280 mL. The patient's arterial line was placed on November 4th at 04:00 PM.

The patient's EKGs were concerning, but cardiac consultation did not reveal any concerning changes. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) was cycled due to diffuse twigs after intubation, but subsequent cycles were negative.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. They received vancomycin on November 4th at 03:15 PM and cefepime on November 5th at 04:12 AM. The patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, who was admitted for respiratory distress. He required intubation due to increased work of breathing and AMS. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 45 bpm, blood pressure of 105/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 500 mL, RR set at 18, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 258 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and a troponin-T level of <0.01. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage with vancomycin and cefepime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining proper hand hygiene, ensuring appropriate positioning, and regular suctioning of subglottic secretions.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as early ambulation and subcutaneous heparin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, who was admitted with respiratory distress and suspected COPD exacerbation. The patient required intubation due to tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and altered mental status. There are concerns about possible healthcare-associated pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a plan to wean to pressure support ventilation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has been decreasing, indicating a possible kidney problem. Further evaluation of urine electrolytes is needed.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, ranging from 40 to 45 beats per minute. This can be a result of sedative medications or underlying cardiac conditions. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram should be checked.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable but there was a drop after intubation with succinylcholine. Propofol, a sedative medication, may also contribute to hypotension. Infection versus sepsis should be ruled out, and broad antibiotic coverage should continue.
4. EKG changes: The patient's EKG shows V3-V4 with 1 mm elevation, but without any signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Aspir"

   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 4221**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5651**], whose notes reflect my
   input.  BP stabilized after volume repletion, though UOP remained low.
   PIPs down a bit. Bradycardia (sinus) persisted but improves with
   stimulation.
   On exam now:
   Sedated.
   Diffuse expiratory wheezes less than yesterday.
   Distant heart.
   Protuberant but soft abdomen.
   No calf edema or cords

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of severe COPD and schizophrenia. He presented to the ICU with an acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, low urine output, and bradycardia. The patient was intubated upon arrival to the floor and continues to have twinning anterior leads with bradycardia. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/56 mmHg to 123/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient has been receiving various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, nicotine patch, colace, methylprednisolone, ppi, azithromycin, albuterol/atropine, and others.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 41%, platelet count of 258 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 127 mg/dL to 159 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels below 0."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD and is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress thought to be due to a COPD exacerbation. He has been receiving high-dose pulse steroids, ventricular assist with a plan to wean to pressure support ventilation (PSV), and coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and azithromycin. The patient's sputum culture has been sent for analysis, and he is scheduled to follow up with blood cultures and sputum culture results.

The patient's urine output has been low, with a FeNa of 0.11% indicating pre-renal causes, and he is being given boluses to achieve a urine output goal of 25 cc/hour. His heart rate remains in the 40s, which may be due to sedation or a vagal response to intubation. His blood pressure has improved to the 100-110s.

An EKG showed changes in leads V3-V4 with 1 mm elevation, but no changes suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Aspirin has already been given, and further evaluation for possible myocardial infarction (ROMI) is pending.

There is a question regarding whether the patient has schizophrenia or mental retardation, as he is on disability for mental health. The decision to start zyprexa at 7.5 mg has been deferred, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and hypotension, not in shock. The patient has been sedated with propofol and is on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/70 to 138/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 66 kg at admission to 73.4 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an input of 4,332 mL and output of 600 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,732 mL since 12 AM. Urine output has improved to 25 cc/hr. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous lines, as well as antibiotics and other medications.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Other lab values such as creatinine, troponin T, and lactate are within normal ranges.

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.31, which indicates respiratory acidosis. The patient's compliance is 37.5 cmH2O/mL, plateau pressure is 23 cmH2"

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
   mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened (?#). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-9-18**],
   suboptimal images on current study, but overall findings are similar
   with normal left ventricular size and systolic function. Hypertrophied
   moderately dilated right ventricle with mildly depressed systolic
   function.

   There is mild hyperinflation consistent with COPD. Increased
   bronchovascular
   markings in the mid and upper left lung unchanged back to [**2159**] is a
   combination of scarring, atelectasis, and emphysema. No acute
   consolidation,

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD who was admitted with respiratory distress. He is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving high-dose pulse steroids for a suspected COPD exacerbation. His current medications include albuterol and ipratropium nebs q2 hours standing, as well as aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate in the 40s, blood pressure in the 100-110s, and oxygen saturation at 100%. His recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, a decreased hematocrit of 41%, and a slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. The troponin-T levels are below the detection limit, indicating no evidence of acute coronary syndrome.

The patient's trans-thoracic echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular size and systolic function, but with a hypertrophied moderately dilated right ventricle and mildly depressed systolic function. There are also findings consistent with COPD, including hyperinflation and increased bronchovascular markings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, daily wake-up"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving high-dose pulse steroids, mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics (Vanc/azithro) for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. He also has oliguria with a urine output of 20-25 cc/hour and is being bolused for low urine output. The patient's heart rate remains in the 40s, which may be due to sedation or a vagal response to intubation. There are no known history of coronary artery disease, but there are EKG changes showing V3-V4 with 1mm elevation, possibly due to poor baseline or lead placement. Aspirin has been given in the emergency department. The patient's mental health history is unclear, as it could be schizophrenia or mental retardation, but he is on disability for mental health. Zyprexa has been deferred for now, and arrangements need to be made for a guardian responsible for healthcare decisions. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/61 mmHg to 135/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/61-135/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has increased from 66 kg at admission to 73.4 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,310 mL (653 mL PO, 3,059 mL IVF) and output of 720 mL urine, resulting in a positive balance of 3,590 mL.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including propofol infusion, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin). Allergies are not reported. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted respiratory distress.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, anxious-appearing patient with poor dentition. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal PMI and S1/S2. Respiratory examination demonstrates diminished breath sounds bilaterally, rhonchi, and the use of accessory muscles. Neurologic examination reveals the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and oriented to person, place"

   64 y.o. M with COPD, admitted with respiratory distress, secondary to
   COPD exacerbation.
   # COPD exacerbation:
   -continue high dose pulse steroids x 3 days (last day today)
   - wean sedation, attempt PS trial and may need to increase PEEP
   -cover for HAP with Vanc x 8 days / azithromycin x 5 days
   -f/u BCx
   -f/u sputum Cx
   -cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs q4 standing
   -resume home spiriva and advair when tolerating PO
   -follow serial ABGs after PS
   # Oliguria: FeNa 0.11%, likely significantly pre-renal, UOP approx 15
   cc / hour
   - bolus for UOP goal of 15-20 cc / hour
   # Bradycardia: continued HR in 40s, believe it may be due to sedation
   vs. vagal response to intubation, BPs improved to 100-110s
   - monitor
   # Schizophrenia vs MR: unclear given notes, on disability for mental

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted for respiratory distress due to a COPD exacerbation.
- He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has received high-dose pulse steroids for his COPD exacerbation and coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and azithromycin.
- There are concerns about the patient's oliguria, with a urine output of approximately 15 cc/hour, and a FeNa of 0.11%, indicating pre-renal azotemia.
- Bradycardia is also present, with a heart rate in the 40s, which may be due to sedation or a vagal response to intubation.
- The patient's mental health history is unclear, with notes indicating schizophrenia or mental retardation, and he is on disability for mental health.
- Nutrition is being provided through tube feeds, and the patient's glycemic control is being monitored.
- The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, and prophylaxis is being provided for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria: The patient's low urine output (<15 cc/hour) indicates possible acute kidney injury (AKI)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted with respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/63 to 147/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various medications including propofol, famotidine, heparin sodium, and antibiotics (cefipime and vancomycin). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress.

The physical examination shows that the patient is well-nourished but anxious, with pupils dilated. The cardiovascular examination reveals normal pulse and blood pressure, while the respiratory examination indicates diminished breath sounds bilaterally with rhonchi. The abdominal examination is unremarkable, and the neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, high potassium, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, the respiratory distress is attributed to a COPD exacerbation, now compounded by volume overload. The plan includes continuing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted with respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, and a small hepatic lesion seen on CT chest. His urine output has improved, but he remains oliguric. He has bradycardia, which may be due to sedation or a vagal response to intubation. The patient's mental health status is unclear, as it is uncertain whether he has schizophrenia or mental retardation. He is on disability for mental health.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation, he is at an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Oliguria and pre-renal azotemia indicate a potential risk for AKI.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Hepatic Lesion: Further evaluation is needed to determine the nature and significance of the small hepatic lesion seen on CT chest.
6. Infection: The presence of ascites and pleural effusions increases the risk of infection, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and was found to have ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, and a small hepatic lesion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 241 K/uL and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 149-202 mg/dL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including propofol, famotidine, heparin, and lansoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or odor, is crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with COPD admitted for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 42 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/56 mmHg to 72/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of schizophrenia or mental retardation, and there is uncertainty regarding the exact diagnosis. The patient has multiple medical conditions including emphysema, bilateral pleural effusion, stable lung nodules, ascites, and a hypodensity in the right liver lobe. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's imaging studies show evidence of emphysema, pleural effusion, liver hypodensity, and a cystic lesion in the left kidney. Microbiology testing reveals the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress secondary to COPD exacerbation can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory failure.
2. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates an excess of fluid intake compared to output, which may contribute to volume overload. This can result in pulmonary ed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with COPD, admitted for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU and is receiving various medications and treatments. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 40s, blood pressure ranging from 104-110 mmHg, respiratory rate at 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been diuresed with Lasix but still has fluid overload. He is also experiencing oliguria with a urine output of 1.5 L/day. The patient's liver function tests show abnormalities, including hypodensity in the right liver lobe. There are also pulmonary nodules present on chest CT. The patient has a history of schizophrenia or mental retardation, and his sister has agreed to become his healthcare proxy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. This can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Volume Overload: Despite diuresis with Lasix, the patient still has fluid overload. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and cardiac complications.
3. Oliguria: The patient's low urine output indicates potential kidney dysfunction. It is important to monitor renal function closely and address any underlying causes.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving various medications including vancomycin, prednisone, albuterol, and ipratropium nebs. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 50s and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient has a positive Gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The respiratory culture indicates sparse growth of commensal respiratory flora. Imaging shows an endotracheal tube in standard placement and a nasogastric tube passing below the diaphragm. There is bilateral infrahilar opacification concerning for pneumonia. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the overnight apnea. The patient has a history of schizophrenia or mental retardation, and his liver shows hypodensity, which may require further evaluation. The patient is currently being managed with ICU care, including glycemic control, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP precautions. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of bilateral infrahilar opacification on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. This can be confirmed through additional diagnostic tests such as sputum culture or bronchoscopy.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, as evidenced by the presence of bilateral infrahilar opacification on chest X-ray. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/61 to 137/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 4 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including propofol infusion, famotidine, furosemide, heparin sodium, and vancomycin. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and potassium levels, while other parameters such as creatinine and glucose are within normal limits. The patient's respiratory viral screen and culture were negative for any viral infections.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The presence of bilateral infrahilar opacification on chest X-ray suggests pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially require more aggressive treatment such as broad-spectrum antibiotics or even mechanical ventilation.

2. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating that they have received less fluid than they have excreted. However, the presence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD who was admitted for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated with medications such as vancomycin, prednisone, albuterol, and ipratropium nebulizers. The patient has shown improvement in his respiratory status but has developed some potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids and diuretics, which may have contributed to volume overload. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, edema, and elevated blood pressure.

2. Overventilation: The patient experienced an episode of apnea overnight, which may be due to overventilation. Overventilation can lead to hypoventilation, resulting in a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 50s, which is below the normal range. Bradycardia can be caused by medications such as beta-blockers or other factors. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rate closely.

4. Schizophrenia vs MR: The patient's mental health history is unclear, with a possibility of schizophrenia or mental retardation. Further evaluation and assessment are needed to determine the appropriate management.

5. Pulmonary Nodules: The patient has pulmonary nodules seen on Chest CT. These nodules"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He has been receiving various treatments including prednisone, vancomycin, albuterol, and ipratropium nebs. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing some complications such as volume overload and bradycardia. Further assessments and plans are outlined in the note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of -1.289 mL, indicating potential volume overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema, hypertension, and heart failure.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 50s, which is below the normal range. Bradycardia can be caused by various factors, including medications or underlying heart conditions.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial admission was for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. This can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia if not adequately managed.
4. Schizophrenia vs MR: The patient's mental health condition is unclear, with the possibility of schizophrenia or mental retardation. Proper evaluation and management are necessary.
5. Pulmonary Nodules: The patient has pulmonary nodules seen on chest CT, which require further evaluation and monitoring.
6. Liver Hypodensity: The patient has liver hypodensity, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving propofol for sedation, famotidine, and heparin prophylaxis. His vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate in the 50s, respiratory rate around 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1.29 liters since midnight. Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, slightly elevated hematocrit and platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal pulmonary nodules and liver hypodensity. The patient's mental health status is unclear due to conflicting notes, but he is on disability for mental health. The plan includes continuing prednisone with taper, vancomycin, albuterol, and ipratropium nebs, attempting a pressure support trial with repeat ABG, monitoring culture data, and managing fluid balance and electrolytes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and COPD exacerbation put him at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Fluid overload: The negative fluid balance and edema assessment suggest a possible volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with COPD who was admitted for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been experiencing several medical issues and complications, including:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to a COPD exacerbation, which has now been complicated by volume overload. Overnight, the patient had an episode of apnea likely due to overventilation.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been in the 50s, but it is stable without any active issues.

3. Schizophrenia vs MR: The patient's mental health condition is unclear due to the limited information available, and he is on disability for mental health. The plan is to continue with the current antipsychotic medication regimen.

4. Pulmonary Nodules: The patient has pulmonary nodules seen on a chest CT scan. It is recommended to perform follow-up CT scans in 2-8 years to assess the stability of the nodules.

5. Liver Hypodensity: There is an area of liver hypodensity that is not fully characterized. It may be necessary to consider an outpatient liver ultrasound (US) for further evaluation.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing prednisone at a dose of 40 mg per day with taper, continuing vancomycin for another 8 days, administering albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers every"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress secondary to COPD exacerbation. He has shown improvement but still requires respiratory support. The patient has been extubated and is tolerating aggressive nebulizers and chest physiotherapy well. Captopril has been started for blood pressure and afterload reduction. The patient has diuresed a total of -3L overnight and has been restarted on home inhalers. The patient's sister and social worker met with him, and he has been determined to have capacity without the need for a guardian.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has a balance of -3,004 mL, indicating possible fluid overload. This could lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
2. Overventilation: The patient experienced an episode of apnea likely due to overventilation. This highlights the importance of careful monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings.
3. Elevated PTT: The patient has an elevated PTT, which may be related to heparin therapy. Further investigation is needed to ensure this is solely due to the heparin effect, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent or manage any potential bleeding complications.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 50s, which is below the normal range. However, it is stable, and no active issues have been identified. Close monitoring should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He has been extubated and is currently on aggressive nebulizers and chest physiotherapy. The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a reading of 135/67 mmHg. His heart rate is within normal limits at 67 beats per minute, and his oxygen saturation is at 95%. The patient's weight has increased from 66 kg at admission to 75.3 kg. He has received captopril for blood pressure and afterload reduction, and autodiuresis has been noted. The patient has been restarted on his home inhalers. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, and although he has been extubated, there is still a risk of further respiratory complications.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly low at 67 beats per minute, which could potentially lead to bradycardia.

3. Hypotension: While the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, there is still a risk of hypotension, especially if there are any changes in fluid balance or medication.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, who was admitted with respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He was intubated but is now extubated and doing well with aggressive nebulizers and chest physiotherapy. He has been started on captopril for blood pressure and afterload reduction. The patient autodiuresed -3 liters at midnight and his home inhalers were restarted. The patient's sister met with a social worker, and it was determined that he does not need a guardian and has capacity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's history of COPD and recent exacerbation puts him at risk for further respiratory complications. Close monitoring of his oxygenation and respiratory status should be continued.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient has completed a course of vancomycin, he is still at risk for developing VAP due to his prolonged ICU stay and intubation history. Monitoring for new consolidation on chest X-rays and obtaining appropriate cultures is important.
3. Elevated PTT: The patient has an elevated PTT, which may indicate a coagulation disorder. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or clotting is necessary, and the cause of the elevated PTT should be investigated further.
4. Bradycardia: The patient had bradycardia, but it has resolved. Continued monitoring of his heart rate is essential to ensure that it"

He is currently extubated and doing well, although he is using accessory muscles to breathe. He has completed a course of vancomycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He is taking various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 127/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. 

Physical examination findings include well-nourished general appearance, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, wheezing breath sounds in the chest, soft non-tender abdomen, no lower extremity edema, and unassessed skin and neurologic status. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.9-11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, platelet count of 266 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6-0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 112-99 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

Plan:
1. Continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3 days with plans to taper to 20mg on [**11-16**].
2. Continue albuterol q4 hr and ipratropirum nebs q6 hours and prn.
3. Continue Advair.
4. Bipap if increased work of breathing.
5. Follow-up culture data-NGTD.
6. Goal at least 1 liter negative fluid balance.
7. Out of bed today.
8. Elevated PTT: monitor likely [**3-10**] heparin.
9. Schizophrenia vs MR: unclear given notes, on disability for mental health.
   - Cont zyprexa 7.5mg per home regimen.
   - Sister is HCP but patient has capacity.
10. Pulmonary nodules: Seen on Chest CT. Would do [**2-8**] year follow CT to assess stability.
11. Liver hypodensity: Not fully characterized; may consider outpatient liver U/S.
12. Nutrition: Regular diet.
13. Glycemic control:

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for arterial line stoppage. The patient has been on bipap for most of the day and is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/48 mmHg to 179/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has shown sinus bradycardia and a weight gain of 10 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 820 mL, with outputs including 600 mL via PO, 220 mL via IVF, and 2,730 mL total output with 520 mL being urine output. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41. Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses and not assessed skin, neurologic, or respiratory status. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on bipap and has a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, indicating possible respiratory distress or failure.
2. Hypotension: Blood pressure readings are variable, ranging from 126/48 mmHg to 179/"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted with respiratory distress due to a COPD exacerbation. He has been extubated and is using accessory muscles to breathe. The patient completed a course of vancomycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is now on several medications including solumedrol, albuterol, ipratropium nebs, bipap overnight, and a sliding scale insulin while on steroids. The patient also has hypertension and an elevated PTT, which is being monitored. Additionally, the patient has schizophrenia versus mental retardation (MR), unclear given the notes, and is on disability for mental health. The patient's sister is a healthcare professional, but the patient has capacity. The patient has pulmonary nodules seen on chest CT and will undergo follow-up CT in 2-8 years to assess stability. Lastly, the patient has liver hypodensity, which may require an outpatient liver ultrasound (US). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's respiratory distress is secondary to a COPD exacerbation. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to further respiratory failure and potential need for reintubation.
2. VAP: Although the patient completed a course of vancomycin, there is still a risk of VAP recurrence due to his continued use of mechanical ventilation support.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted for respiratory distress due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been extubated and is doing well but using accessory muscles to breathe. He completed an 8-day course of vancomycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's current medications include solumedrol (125 mg q6 hours), albuterol (q4 hr), ipratropirum nebs (q6 hours), prn, continue advair, bipap if increased work of breathing (WOB), and f/u culture data from nasogastric tube (NGTD). 

The patient has hypertension and the dose of captopril has been increased to 25 mg three times a day. An elevated PTT is noted and will be monitored while on heparin. 

The patient's mental health status is unclear between schizophrenia and mental retardation, but he is on disability for mental health and his sister is a healthcare provider. His current medication regimen includes zyprexa 7.5 mg per home regimen.

Pulmonary nodules seen on chest CT will be followed up with a 2-8 year CT scan to assess stability. Liver hypodensity may require an outpatient liver ultrasound (US).

In the ICU, the patient's nutritional needs are being met, glycemic control is being maintained, and appropriate lines have been placed. Prophyl"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, prior intubations, hospitalization, schizophrenia, and other issues. He is currently in the ICU for a presumptive COPD flare and was previously on ventilator support, now extubated since [**2160-11-11**]. The patient remains in the ICU with tenuous pulmonary status characterized by poor air movement, hypoxia, and significant wheezing.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 62 bpm (58-87 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 120/64 mmHg to 163/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (20-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), solumedrol 125 q6, and other ICU medications such as nicotine patch, albuterol nebs, atrovent, and captopril.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data shows the patient's weight at 70.6 kg (admission weight: 66 kg), total fluid intake of 600 mL, intake by mouth of 600 mL, total output of 2565 mL (including 580 mL blood products), urine output of 2565 mL (including 580 mL blood products), and negative fluid balance of 1965 mL (-580 mL).

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool device, with an oxygen saturation of 96% and ABG results not provided in the note.

During the physical examination, the patient is alert, with no murmurs, murmurs, or gallops on cardiovascular examination, diffuse expiratory wheezes, very poor air movement bilaterally on pulmonary examination, soft abdomen, no focal deficits on neurologic examination, and no complaints or findings on extremity examination.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, platelet count of 232 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 25 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, chloride of 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 41 mEq/L, glucose of 99 mg/dL, and magnesium of 1.7 mEq/L.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prior intubations, hospitalizations, schizophrenia, and other issues. He was admitted with a presumptive COPD flare requiring ventilator support. The patient is now extubated but remains in the ICU in a tenuous pulmonary status characterized by poor air movement, hypoxia, and significant wheezing.

24-hour events include restarting IV solumedrol and increasing captopril. The patient has no known drug allergies. His current medications include heparin sodium, solumedrol, nicotine patch, albuterol nebs, atrovent, and captopril.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 62 bpm (58-87 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 120/64 mmHg to 163/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (20-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes, very poor air movement bilaterally, alert general appearance, regular rhythm without murmurs, soft abdomen, no extremity complaints or issues, and no focal neurological deficits.

Lab results show a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g"

   BiPAO. He has been on a Prednisone taper, going from Solumedrol to
   Prednisone 60mg to 30mg of Prednisone yesterday. Given we have limited
   therapeutic options, we will again burst him with IV steroids. He needs
   to work with PT to assess his functional status. He may need to be
   d/c
ed to pulmonary rehab directly rather than go to the floor first.
   Up, out of bed today. He will need an out-patient CT in ~1 year to f/u
   his pulmonary nodules. His RV is dysfunctional and he has some degree
   of pulmonary hypertension (~40mm Hg in [**9-13**]), but that would not
   explain his obstructive symptoms of poor air movement, tachypnea and
   wheezing.

   Propofol. Goal 1L negative today. His weight is still ~9kg up from
   admission. Follow
lytes and replete as needed. Continue Captopril at
   12.5mg TID, will increase to 25mg today given his BPs continue to be

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of COPD, prior intubations, hospitalizations, schizophrenia, and other issues. He was admitted with a presumptive COPD flare and required ventilator support. The patient is now extubated but remains in the ICU with tenuous pulmonary status characterized by poor air movement, hypoxia, and significant wheezing. He has been in the ICU for 3-10 days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tenuous pulmonary status indicates ongoing respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential need for re-intubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating hypotension. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or fluid loss. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management is necessary to prevent hypotensive shock.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is below the normal range, indicating bradycardia. It is important to assess the underlying cause and ensure adequate cardiac function.
4. Infection: The patient's history of COPD flare-up and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and underlying risk factors may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, hypotension, and bradycardia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 120/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has increased from 66 kg at admission to 70.6 kg currently.

The patient has received infusions of heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, TCO2, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which can be a life-threatening condition if not properly managed. This could potentially worsen if the patient's oxygenation or ventilation parameters deteriorate.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may indicate poor perfusion and inadequate blood flow to vital organs. If not promptly addressed, it could lead to organ damage or failure.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. He has been extubated and is doing well but using accessory muscles to breathe. The patient completed a course of Vancomycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on several medications including solumedrol, albuterol, ipratropirum nebs, bipap overnight, and others.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate within normal limits, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation at 93%. His weight has increased from admission.

The physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, attentive neurologic status, and soft non-tender abdomen. The patient's labs indicate some abnormalities such as elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab results appear relatively stable.

The patient has several pending cultures and tests including sputum gram stain and culture, respiratory viral screen and culture, blood culture, and urine Legionella antigen.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of the patient's respiratory distress due to COPD exacerbation, monitoring of medication effects, titration of antihypertensive medication, and evaluation of prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The patient also has a history of schizophrenia or mental retardation, pulmonary nodules, and liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress secondary to a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been extubated and is doing well, but using accessory muscles to breathe, particularly after eating quickly. He completed a course of Vancomycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and will now be transitioned to oral prednisone for steroid treatment. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 135/70 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's use of accessory muscles to breathe, especially after eating quickly, indicates ongoing respiratory distress. This could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially necessitate re-intubation.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is within the elevated range. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medication may be necessary.
3. Elevated PTT: The patient has an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a potential bleeding risk. Monitoring and adjusting heparin dosage will be required.
4. Schizophrenia vs MR: The patient's mental health status is unclear due to inconsistent notes."

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and bradycardia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 135/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's condition has been stable over the past few days, with improvements in vital signs and laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which may require ongoing respiratory support and monitoring.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is on the lower end of normal, indicating bradycardia. Monitoring and management of heart rate is important to prevent any potential complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure is necessary to ensure adequate perfusion and prevent complications such as shock.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, prior intubations, hospitalizations, schizophrenia, and other issues. He was admitted with a presumptive COPD flare requiring ventilator support and has since been successfully extubated. The patient remains in the ICU with tenuous pulmonary status, characterized by poor air movement, hypoxia, and significant wheezing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have very poor air movement despite being extubated and receiving solumedrol for increased work of breathing. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the current treatment plan does not improve his respiratory status.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient shows signs of resolving pulmonary edema without diuresis. However, if the edema worsens or does not improve, it may lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count likely secondary to steroid use. Monitoring for signs of infection is crucial to prevent or manage potential infections.
4. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia requires ongoing management with Zyprexa. Monitoring for any exacerbation of symptoms is important.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis for DVT should be continued to prevent the development of blood clots.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding, and"

He was admitted with a presumptive COPD flare requiring ventilator support. The patient has been extubated but remains in the ICU with tenuous pulmonary status. He is experiencing poor air movement, hypoxia, and significant wheezing. The patient's allergies, review of systems, and vital signs are noted. The flow sheet data shows fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information. The patient's labs and radiology results are also provided.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several assessments including respiratory failure (not ARDS), pulmonary edema, and schizophrenia. The respiratory failure assessment indicates that the patient is still experiencing very poor air movement despite being extubated and receiving solumedrol. Nebulizers will continue to be used, and consideration will be given to changing to prednisone if there is improvement. The pulmonary edema appears to be resolving without diuresis. The schizophrenia assessment includes continuing Zyprexa and following clinically. Other plans involve ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and disposition."

","The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of COPD, prior intubations and hospitalizations, schizophrenia, and other issues. He is currently in the ICU for a presumptive COPD flare requiring ventilator support. The patient was successfully extubated on [**11-11**] and was initially on BiPAP post-extubation, with solumedrol restarted on [**11-14**] due to increased work of breathing. He continues to have very poor air movement, but shows slight improvement in accessory muscle use. The patient will receive an additional two days of IV steroids and will be transitioned to oral prednisone at a dose of 60mg daily. He is currently on BIPAP at night.

The patient has a diagnosis of respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), pulmonary edema, and schizophrenia. The respiratory failure is described as being due to a COPD flare. The pulmonary edema seems to be resolving without the need for diuretics.

There are some potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided. These include the possibility of infection, as indicated by leukocytosis which may be secondary to the steroids being administered. Monitoring for signs of infection will be important in this case.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with heparin, stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor"
