   # stridor: unclear [**Name2 (NI) 3360**].  Radiology taken including CTs and he has

   would expect less acute onset unless there was hemorrhage (no anemia).
   The fact that his breath sounds are clear with the ET tube in place
   suggests that there might be an upper airway source.  This might be
   assessed with bronchoscopy.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, stroke, hypertension, and ethanol abuse who presented with stridor and was intubated. He has undergone several tests including a trans thoracic echo, ultrasound, and CT scans. His vital signs are stable, but he has mild hypothermia, bradycardia, and low blood pressure. He is on mechanical ventilation with supplemental oxygen. His blood work shows elevated BNP levels, but his ejection fraction is normal. There are no signs of infection or anemia. The patient has a history of smoking, which raises concerns for an obstructing mass causing the stridor. Further assessments such as bronchoscopy and imaging studies are needed to determine the cause.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: The patient's history of smoking and acute onset of stridor raise concerns for a possible obstructing mass in the upper airway. This could lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for airway intervention.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken, such as subcutaneous heparin.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay may predispose him to stress ulcer formation. Prophylactic H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors should be considered.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation or vasopressor support may be needed.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's mild hypothermia should be addressed promptly to prevent further complications. Warm blankets and controlled warming measures should be utilized.
7. Ethanol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of ethanol abuse, monitoring for signs of withdrawal and providing appropriate management with benzodiazepines if necessary is important.
8. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function. Ongoing monitoring and appropriate management are required.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based solely on the provided progress note. Additional information and clinical judgment may be necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, stroke, and hypertension. He presented with stridor and was intubated. The patient has been suctioning blood from the endotracheal tube, and a CT scan of the neck and head did not show a clear etiology for the stridor.

The patient is currently doing well on assisted control ventilation (AC) and is being monitored closely. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was performed today, and the plan is to extubate the patient tomorrow with anesthesia present in case of re-intubation. The patient will also be recultured for an infectious etiology and considered for a bronchoscopy if extubation is unsuccessful.

The patient has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which indicates possible heart failure despite normal ejection fraction on echocardiogram. Lasix was given, but the patient remained hypotensive with low urine output. Hydration will be provided today with 250 ml normal saline.

The patient also has elevated blood glucose levels, which are being managed conservatively without the use of insulin at this time. The patient's history of hypertension will be addressed once the underlying cause is determined, and medications such as diovan will be held for now due to the possibility of needing procedures.

Other issues noted in the progress note include a history of stroke, COPD exacerbation, alcohol abuse, and antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, stroke, hypertension, and possible ethanol abuse. He presented with stridor and was intubated. The CT scan did not show a clear etiology for the stridor. The patient has been receiving steroids for cord edema and has a cuff leak. His vital signs are stable, and he is currently on CPAP/PSV with a planned extubation today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper airway edema: The patient's initial presentation of stridor suggests upper airway edema, which could lead to respiratory distress if not managed properly.
2. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, and his current condition may worsen due to the respiratory distress and potential lung infections.
3. Infectious etiology: The presence of GNR bacteria in the sputum suggests a possible respiratory infection, which could progress to pneumonia if not treated appropriately.
4. Hypotension and low urine output: The patient's low blood pressure and reduced urine output indicate potential hypoperfusion and acute kidney injury, which may require further investigation and management.
5. Stroke: The patient's history of stroke raises concerns about neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure or new ischemic events.
6. Ethanol abuse: Although there is no current evidence of withdrawal, the patient's history of ethanol abuse may increase the risk of delir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, stroke, hypertension, and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with stridor and subsequently intubated. The CT scan of the neck and head did not show a clear etiology for the stridor. The patient has been suctioning blood from the endotracheal tube. His current vital signs are stable, but he has a history of atrial fibrillation. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from 161/78 mmHg to 187/94 mmHg. The patient is expected to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial today and may be extubated depending on anesthesia availability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper suctioning and hygiene measures should be implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be continued to prevent clot formation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he experienced hypotension after receiving Lasix. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is crucial to prevent further episodes of hypotension.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, stroke, hypertension, and ethanol abuse. He was admitted with stridor and intubated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 161/78 mmHg (187/61-170/107 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 55. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, overweight/obese status, normal cardiovascular examination, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility.
2. Ventilator-associated events: The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated lung injury.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's low urine output and elevated blood pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, stroke, hypertension, who presented with stridor and was intubated. He is currently extubated and showing encouraging ABGs. The patient has a pre-renal picture based on urine electrolytes, and he received a bolus of fluids. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/96 mmHg to 123/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 386 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%. His ABG results are within normal limits, indicating adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and obesity. He has cervical lymphadenopathy, cardiovascular system examination shows regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops, respiratory system examination shows clear to bi-basal crepitations with some wheezing, and neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. However, the patient has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, but his left ventricular ejection fraction is normal. He also has elevated blood glucose levels, which are not significantly abnormal.

Plan:

1. SBT today, plan to extubate possibly today depending on anesthesia availability.
2. Follow-up cultures for infectious etiology.
3. Consider bronchoscopy if extubation is unsuccessful.
4. Elevated BNP: Normal ejection fraction by echo. Does not look overloaded, but has some pleural effusions. Got lasix X 1 yesterday but is hypotensive with low urine output.
   - Given rising creatinine, will not attempt diuresis today.
5. Elevated Creatinine: 
   - Check urine lytes, no diuretics today.
   - Continue to monitor.
   - Hold ACE and ARBs.
6. Elevated Blood Glucose: By finger stick, BG was 150. OK by chem 7. No history of diabetes.
   - Conservative sugar screening initiative.
7. HTN: Pt currently normotensive.
   - On diovan at home, holding due to elevated creatinine.
8. Hx of stroke: Restart ASA and Aggrenox today.
9. COPD: Not currently wheezing.
   - Nebulizers as needed.
10. EtOH abuse: Has no evidence of withdrawal.
    - CIWA.
11. PPx: Sc heparin, bowel reg, h2 blocker.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, stroke, hypertension, and possible ethanol abuse. He presented with stridor and was intubated but is now extubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 147/96 mmHg, heart rate of 62 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is receiving several medications including heparin, ASA, Aggrenox, and steroids, which are being tapered due to high doses given previously. The patient's recent lab results show elevated BNP, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. There is no evidence of infection in the urine or sputum. The patient has been placed on maintenance IV fluids and is scheduled for tube feeds due to inadequate mental status for taking oral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pre-renal azotemia: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests possible pre-renal azotemia, which could be due to dehydration or decreased renal perfusion.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose level indicates hyperglycemia, which may require further investigation and management, especially considering the absence of a known history of diabetes.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the higher side, indicating potential hypertension. However, the presence of hypotension during diuresis suggests the need for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He was admitted with respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient was intubated due to stridor and received steroids as primary treatment. He has successfully been extubated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 168/68 to 185/109 mmHg, heart rate of 64 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's weight is currently 72.1 kg.

Physical examination findings include normal head, ears, nose, and throat; distant S2 heart sound; diminished breath sounds; symmetric chest expansion; resonant percussion note; soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds; trace edema in both lower extremities; and muscle wasting. Neurological examination reveals an attentive patient who is oriented to person, place, and time, with normal upper extremity reflexes and left lower extremity reflexes. There are surgical changes noted in the left pupil, and the right pupil appears normal.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and altered electrolyte levels. Microbiology tests indicate the presence of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, stroke, hypertension, who presented with stridor and was intubated. The patient is currently doing well post-extubation. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including elevated BNP with normal ejection fraction, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient also has a history of stroke and is on aspirin and Aggrenox. The patient has been diagnosed with COPD and is receiving nebs as needed. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse but does not show any signs of withdrawal. The patient has undergone bowel regularization and is on a heparin lock. The patient's mental status is not adequate for taking oral medications, so they will be placed on tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stridor: The patient presented with stridor, which can indicate airway obstruction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, as the CT scan of the neck and head did not show a clear etiology.
2. Infection: The patient has cultures pending for an infectious etiology, which suggests a concern for infection.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but is currently normotensive. The patient is on Diovan at home and low-dose losartan due to elevated creatinine.
4. Elevated BNP: The patient has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels, indicating possible heart failure."

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, stroke, hypertension who presented with stridor and was intubated. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107-193 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and creatinine levels. The blood glucose level is slightly elevated at 115 mg/dL. Other labs such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range. Sputum culture reveals the presence of gram-negative rods and oropharyngeal flora.

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions. The first one is related to stridor, where the cause is unclear, and no fluid collections were seen on CT scan. The patient was started on high-dose steroids due to concern for upper airway edema/swelling, but no evidence thereof on extubation.

The second condition is elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) with normal ejection fraction by echo. The patient does not look overloaded but has some pleural effusions. Lasix was given once, but then the patient became hypotensive with low urine output, so diuresis was"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with known history of chronic obstructive lung disease now
   admit with respiratory failure and concern for upper airway obstruction
   but now able to tolerate extubation without evidence of upper airway
   compromise.  HE has had some significant issues with tolerance of PO
   intake and risk is elevated for aspiration event and one does wonder if
   the initial insult of stridor may well have been laryngeal irritation
   with reflux as lesion not seen upon extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He had evidence of aspiration and some agitation, but was able to tolerate extubation without upper airway compromise. The patient has delirium and confusion, oliguria/anuria, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including diazepam, heparin sodium, and hydralazine. He has been on tube feeds and will continue with glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications that require close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The evidence of aspiration increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
3. Delirium and Confusion: The patient's delirium and confusion could worsen due to alcohol withdrawal, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying medical conditions.
