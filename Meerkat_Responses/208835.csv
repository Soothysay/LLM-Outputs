   Assesment: 68 year old male with history mets NSCLC with extensive
   lymphadenopathy in the abdomen presenting with acute exacerbation of
   abdominal pain in the last 24 hours
   .
   # Abdominal pain
   Given the findings on CT scan and physical exam the most likely
   etiology is secondary to malignant infiltration of the abdominal cavity
   as evidenced by extensive increase in lymphadenopathy throughout the
   abdomen. There is no evidence of perforation or SBO which would be high
   on the differential. There is concern for infectious involvement of the
   necrotic areas seen within the lymph nodes, cannot rule out TB although
   he has no risk factors other than immunosuppression from his lung
   cancer.
   - pain control with dilaudid
   - continue levo/flagyl
   - f/u blood cx
   - will need biospy of lymp nodes to ensure this is not a new primary
   malignancy such as a lymphoma and not metastatic lung cancer

   # RLL pneumonia
   Seen incidentally on CT scan, postobstrucitive given the location in
   relation to the tumor.
   - stop levofloxacin and monitor given afebrile with no cough and chest
   radiograph unchanged from prior

   # Atrial fibrillation
   Has been difficult to control and know this is exacerbated by the fact
   he is infected and in significant amount of pain, he also has not taken
   his medications for the past 48 hours.
   - rate control with Toprol XL 100mg PO bid, home doses
   - pain control

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive lymphadenopathy in the abdomen. He presented with acute exacerbation of abdominal pain in the last 24 hours. The patient has tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and is difficult to control. He has not taken his medications for the past 48 hours. The patient also has pneumonia in the right lower lobe, which is post-obstructive due to the known hilar mass. There are multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes with necrotic centers, concerning for metastatic disease or lymphoma, but infection, particularly tuberculosis, cannot be excluded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain: The most likely etiology is secondary to malignant infiltration of the abdominal cavity. There is concern for infectious involvement of the necrotic areas seen within the lymph nodes, and tuberculosis cannot be ruled out.
2. RLL pneumonia: This is seen incidentally on the CT scan and is post-obstructive given its location in relation to the tumor. Monitoring and stopping levofloxacin may be necessary as the patient is afebrile with no cough and chest radiograph unchanged from prior.
3. Atrial fibrillation: It has been difficult to control and is exacerbated by significant pain, non-adherence to medication, and possible infection.
4. Acidosis- AG: This is likely due"

   admitted with abdominal pain in the setting of progression of
   lymphadenopathy.  He has had evaluation of his CT scan which does
   appear less likely to be a new acute pneumonia.  Abdominal pain is
   suggestive of worsening of underlying disease and pain control will be
   at issues over the immediate course.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and chronic atrial fibrillation. He presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The initial impression is the progression of known disease. 

The patient's 24-hour events include being admitted overnight, seen by surgery with no need for the operating room, a CT scan showing worsening lower abdominal pain (LAD) and possible infected lymph node, poor rate control in the emergency department, and no good response to fluids.

The patient's allergies include Chantix (Varenicline Tartrate) with stomach cramps. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) and Pantoprazole (Protonix), as well as prophylactic Heparin Sodium.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting in the gastrointestinal system. His cardiovascular system is unchanged, but he does have worsening LAD on the CT scan.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 121 bpm with a range of 115-152 bpm, blood pressure of 121/57 mmHg with a range of 111/54-135/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute with a range"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and chronic atrial fibrillation. He presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The initial impression suggests the progression of known disease. The patient has undergone a CT scan, which shows worsening localized abdominal disease and possible infected lymph node. The possibility of pneumonia seems less likely upon reviewing the CT scan. The patient's abdominal pain and nausea or vomiting are likely due to the involvement of the localized abdominal disease, although the acute onset of symptoms is unclear. It is believed that these symptoms are consistent with the progression of the disease.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 121 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 121/57 mmHg to 135/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been given various medications such as hydromorphone, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal pain with nausea or vomiting: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea or vomiting are attributed to the worsening localized abdominal disease. It is important to provide better pain"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old male with history mets NSCLC with extensive lymphadenopathy
   in the abdomen presenting with acute exacerbation of abdominal pain in
   the last 24 hours
   # Abdominal pain
   Given the findings on CT scan and physical exam the most likely
   etiology is secondary to malignant infiltration of the abdominal cavity
   as evidenced by extensive increase in lymphadenopathy throughout the
   abdomen. There is no evidence of perforation or SBO which would be high
   on the differential. Onc feels that his acute abdominal pain and n/v is
   consistent with the acute progression of his cancer.
   - pain control with dilaudid switched to hydrocodone due to nausea and
   itching
   - continue fentanyl patch 25mcg per onc
   - f/u blood cx
 but low concern for infection at this point.
   - follow up with onc re: need for biospy of lymp nodes to ensure
   metastatic vs second primary
   # RLL infiltrate: initially concern re: PNA but given patient is s/p
   XRT to lungs and changes are seen on [**12-3**] CT scan.  There is a low
   likelihood of pna given no fevers, sob, cough or increased wbc
   -no need for abx currently

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive lymphadenopathy in the abdomen. He is currently admitted to the ICU for an acute exacerbation of abdominal pain. 

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been diagnosed with NSCLC and extensive lymphadenopathy in the abdomen.
- He is presenting with acute abdominal pain, which is likely secondary to malignant infiltration of the abdominal cavity.
- Pain control measures have been implemented, including switching from dilaudid to hydrocodone due to nausea and itching.
- Further follow-up with oncology is needed to determine if a biopsy of the lymph nodes is required to differentiate between metastasis and a second primary.
- There is also an infiltration in the right lower lobe of the lung, initially concerning for pneumonia but now considered low likelihood due to the patient's lack of symptoms and increased white blood cell count.
- Antibiotics are not currently necessary for the lung infiltration.
- The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, likely due to the new secundum atrial septal defect (ASD). Rate control measures have been initiated with Toprol XL 200mg PO bid.
- The patient's elevated INR of 6.2 is being addressed by holding anticoagulation and administering Vitamin K.
- Consultation with cardiology is required to assess the need for digoxin and potential treatment or procedure for the ASD.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive lymphadenopathy in the abdomen. He is currently in the ICU for an acute exacerbation of abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and has been difficult to control.

The patient's imaging results show a suboptimal echocardiogram with small pericardial effusion, normal global biventricular systolic function, small secundum atrial septal defect versus stretched patent foramen ovale, and borderline pulmonary hypertension. The prior study from [**2194-4-2**] reveals a new atrial septal defect and reduced severity of tricuspid regurgitation. The rhythm now appears to be atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 55%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4880 cells/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 488,000 cells/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive lymphadenopathy in the abdomen. He is currently admitted to the ICU with an acute exacerbation of abdominal pain. The most likely etiology is secondary to malignant infiltration of the abdominal cavity. There is no evidence of perforation or small bowel obstruction.

Potential medical complications:
1. Abdominal pain - The patient's acute abdominal pain and nausea are consistent with the acute progression of his cancer. Pain control measures such as dilaudid have been initiated, but the patient experiences nausea as a side effect. Consideration for pretreatment per oncology recommendation is being made. Fentanyl patch has been added per oncology recommendation.
2. Right lower lobe infiltrate - There is concern for post-obstructive pneumonia or atelectasis due to the worsening right lower lobe consolidation. However, given the patient's previous radiation therapy to the lungs and the absence of fever, shortness of breath, cough, or increased white blood cell count, there is a low likelihood of pneumonia. Antibiotics are not currently needed, and follow-up cultures are pending.
3. Atrial fibrillation - The patient's atrial fibrillation has been difficult to control, and it is exacerbated by the significant pain and lack of medication adherence over the past 48 hours. Toprol XL has been increased to 150 mg PO bid, and further rate control measures will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive lymphadenopathy in the abdomen. He presented with acute exacerbation of abdominal pain in the last 24 hours. The patient has several medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, elevated INR, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Abdominal pain: The patient's acute abdominal pain is likely due to malignant infiltration of the abdominal cavity as evidenced by extensive increase in lymphadenopathy throughout the abdomen. There is no evidence of perforation or small bowel obstruction (SBO) which would be high on the differential.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely the presentation of a new atrial septal defect (ASD); may be exacerbated by pain. Rate control with Toprol XL 200mg PO bid has been initiated. Pain control measures, repeat TTE assessment for pericardial effusion, and consultation with cardiology are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old male with history mets NSCLC with extensive lymphadenopathy
   in the abdomen presenting with acute exacerbation of abdominal pain in
   the last 24 hours
   # Abdominal pain
   Given the findings on CT scan and physical exam the most likely
   etiology is secondary to malignant infiltration of the abdominal cavity
   as evidenced by extensive increase in lymphadenopathy throughout the
   abdomen. There is no evidence of perforation or SBO which would be high
   on the differential. Onc feels that his acute abdominal pain and n/v is
   consistent with the acute progression of his cancer.
   - pain well controlled with hydrocodone (dilaudid caused nausea &
   itching)
   - continue fentanyl patch 25mcg per onc
   - f/u blood cx
 but low concern for infection at this point.
   - follow up with onc re: need for biospy of lymp nodes to ensure
   metastatic vs second primary
   # RLL infiltrate: initially concern re: PNA but given patient is s/p
   XRT to lungs and changes are seen on [**12-3**] CT scan.  There is a low
   likelihood of pna given no fevers, sob, cough or increased wbc
   -no need for abx currently
   -fup cx.
   # Atrial fibrillation: likely the presentation of new ASD (secundum);
   may be exacerbated by pain; TSH wnl
   - rate control with Toprol XL 200mg PO bid
   - pain control (fentanyl patch and hydrocodone po)
   - prn lopressor if needed
   - holding coumadin overnight for high INR but with Vit K, INR down to
   1.7 today.  Unclear if Onc would like to do LN bx
 will continue to
   hold and follow up with onc re: restarting anticoagulation.
   # Elevated INR 1.7 from 6.2 yesterday:  holding coumadin (high INR
   likely due to antibiotic interaction with coumadin inc levels)
   - will hold anticoagulation
   # NSCLC
   - defer tx to ONCOLOGY team
   # FEN:  continue full liquid diet; advance diet as tolerated to
   regular; (supplement with Ensure shakes)
   Replete K & Mg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic abdominal pain, and advanced non-small cell lung cancer. He is currently admitted to the ICU for rate control of atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, and nutritional support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 95-120 bpm, blood pressure between 98-137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. He is intubated but not on mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, normal creatinine, and altered liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation despite medication adjustments. This can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events if not properly managed.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 1.7 and a history of significant bleeding. There is a risk of further bleeding complications if appropriate measures are not taken to stabilize the coagulation profile.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness if not corrected promptly.
4. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium levels are low, which can contribute to muscle cramps,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (A-fib). 

The patient's history includes chronic abdominal pain, which has improved with lactulose treatment. They have received vitamin K for an elevated INR of 6.9, showing a good response. The patient has allergies to Chantix and Dilaudid.

The patient's current medications include beta-blockers for rate control of A-fib, as well as other ICU medications and regular medications mentioned in the note.

The patient's review of systems reveals fatigue, no fever, weight loss, tachycardia, and no chest pain. They have a history of chronic abdominal pain but no other significant respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, or neurologic complaints.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, normal-sized pupils, and normal breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows no murmurs, and peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, purposeful movement, and normal tone.

Laboratory results indicate anemia (Hct 24.0%), elevated WBC count (487 K/uL), slightly low platelet count (487 K/uL), and various electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypernatremia"
