   80F with DM, HTN, dementia, diverticulosis/GIB, intially admitted to
   SICU with abdominal abscess thought to be [**3-6**] perforated diverticulum,
   now s/p I&D with post-op course c/b respiratory failure/intubation [**3-6**]
   CHF vs. aspiration PNA. [**Hospital 14204**] transferred to the CCU with tachy-brady
   syndrome, awaiting PPM placement on Monday.
   .
   # Tachy-Brady Syndrome: The patient has had labile heart rates while on
   the medicine floor. Pt with episodes of tachycardia (sinus tach vs.
   a-tach recently, for which she has been on metoprolol). However,
   recently, she has also been experiencing pauses on tele. This morning,
   her beta blocker had been on hold for ~18 hours, when she developed
   longer pauses on telemetry, the longest of which was 4.5 seconds. After
   a family meeting, it was decided that the patient would be full code
   and would undergo PPM placement. She is being transferred to the CCU
   for monitoring until her PPM is placed.
   - PM placement on Monday
   - appreciate EP recs
   - pacer pads on patient
   - atropine at bedside
   - continue telemetry
   - monitor for signs of hypoperfusion (hypotension, decreased UOP) if pt
   develops bradycardia
   - holding metoprolol
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt is s/p extubation on [**4-20**]. Her respiratory
   failure was thought to be [**3-6**] CHF versus aspiration PNA. Of note, no
   mention of PNA on recent CXR and pt has had no positive blood cx (no
   sputum cx sent). She does has bilateral pleural effusions noted on
   chest x-ray. Respiratory status improved, pt sat'ing 100% on RA at this
   time. Pt with peripheral edema on exam.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - continue ipratropium nebs
   - continue lasix 40 mg IV daily
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - stricts I/O's
   - agree with primary team to hold off on tapping pleural effusions at
   this time
   .
   # Abdominal Abscess: S/p drainage. On vanc/zosyn. Recent CT scan
   showing resolution of fluid collections, with only a small amount of
   free fluid in the pelvis. Colocutaneous fistula draining feculant fluid
   on lower abdomen; however, pt's nutritional status to poor to fix this
   at this point.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - continue to monitor fever curve
   - continue to monitor abdominal exam
   .
   # Diffuse Edema: Likely related to poor nutritional status, with
   albumin of 1.8.
   - continue tube feeds
   - appreciate nutrition recs
   - continue lasix, as above
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt with dementia. Not clear what her baseline
   is, however. Currently, she is somnolent but responds to verbal
   stimuli.
   - restart aricept 5 mg
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - touch base with family re: baseline mental status
   - reorientation, maintain sleep/wake cycle
   .
   # HTN/CHF: Normotensive on exam. Peripheral edema present; but seems
   that it may be more related to poor nutritional state.
   - restarting valsartan 80 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, aspirin 81 mg
   - continue to monitor blood pressure and fluid status
   .
   # DM: On ISS. Continue to monitor blood glucose.
   .
   # Elevated Alk Phos: Improving. ?related to recent intraabdominal
   infection. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Anemia: H/o GIB. Hct has been stable. Continue to trend. Restart PPI.

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dementia, diverticulosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, and an abdominal abscess. She was initially admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for an abdominal abscess thought to be a perforated diverticulum, and then underwent incision and drainage. Postoperatively, she developed respiratory failure and required intubation. She was transferred to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU) with a diagnosis of tachy-brady syndrome, which is characterized by episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia. The patient has had labile heart rates while on the medicine floor and has been on metoprolol, but recently she has also been experiencing pauses on telemetry. After a family meeting, it was decided that the patient would be full code and would undergo permanent pacemaker (PPM) placement. She is being transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for monitoring until her PPM is placed.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, abdominal abscess, diffuse edema, altered mental status, hypertension and congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and anemia. She is currently on various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, heparin sodium, atropine, metoprolol, ipratropium nebulizers, lasix, and valsartan.

The plan is to continue vanc/zosyn, monitor respiratory status, continue ipratropium nebs, continue lasix 40 mg IV daily, monitor for signs of hypoperfusion if bradycardia develops, hold metoprolol, continue telemetry, and monitor for any changes in the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dementia, diverticulosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, and an initial admission to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for an abdominal abscess thought to be a perforated diverticulum. The patient underwent incision and drainage but developed respiratory failure and required intubation. She was later transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) with tachy-brady syndrome, awaiting pacemaker placement.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Tachy-Brady Syndrome: The patient has labile heart rates with episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia. She is being monitored for signs of hypoperfusion and has been placed on pacer pads.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was extubated on [**4-20**] after her respiratory failure was attributed to either congestive heart failure (CHF) or aspiration pneumonia (PNA). Her respiratory status has improved, but she still has bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Abdominal Abscess: The patient underwent drainage and is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. A recent CT scan shows resolution of fluid collections, but there is still a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The patient also has a colocutaneous fistula draining feculent fluid.

The patient's current situation is as follows:

1. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure (CHF) or aspiration pneumonia (PNA). However, recent chest X-ray shows improving bilateral pleural effusions, and there have been no positive blood cultures or sputum cultures. The patient is currently extubated and breathing spontaneously.

2. The patient is experiencing tachy-brady syndrome, characterized by labile heart rates including episodes of sinus tachycardia and atrial tachycardia. She has had pauses on telemetry, which led to the decision to place a permanent pacemaker (PPM). However, due to the patient's poor functional status and potential unsuitability for PPM placement, further evaluation is needed. The patient's heart rate is currently in the 120s without pauses.

3. The patient has diffuse edema likely related to poor nutritional status and low albumin levels. She also has a history of GIB, and her nutritional status is poor.

   Assessment and Plan
   80F with DM, HTN, dementia, diverticulosis/GIB, intially admitted to
   SICU with abdominal abscess thought to be [**3-6**] perforated diverticulum,
   now s/p I&D with post-op course c/b respiratory failure/intubation [**3-6**]
   CHF vs. aspiration PNA. [**Hospital 14204**] transferred to the CCU with tachy-brady
   syndrome, awaiting PPM placement on Monday.
   .
   # Tachy-Brady Syndrome: The patient had labile heart rates while on the
   medicine floor. Pt with episodes of tachycardia (sinus tach vs. a-tach
   recently, for which she has been on metoprolol). However, recently, she
   has also been experiencing pauses on tele. Her beta blocker had been on
   hold for ~18 hours, when she developed longer pauses on telemetry, the
   longest of which was 4.5 seconds. After a family meeting, it was
   decided that the patient would be full code and would undergo PPM
   placement. She was transferred to the CCU for monitoring. However, on
   further assessment, the patient
s functional status was noted to be
   quite poor, and she may not be suitable for PM placement.  Overnight
   her heart rate has been tachycardi in 120s with no pauses.
   - need to hold another family meeting to further address goals of care,
   but complicated picture involving HCP and guardianship and so
   requesting social work for help in figuring this out
   - Will attempt to have family meeting this week to discuss option of PM
   placement
   - pacer pads on patient
   - atropine at bedside
   - continue telemetry
   - monitor for signs of hypoperfusion (hypotension, decreased UOP) if pt
   develops bradycardia
   - holding metoprolol as would prefer her to be tachycardic (currently
   assymptomatic from this) instead of bradycardic
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt is s/p extubation on [**4-20**]. Her respiratory
   failure was thought to be [**3-6**] CHF versus aspiration PNA. Of note, no
   mention of PNA on recent CXR and pt has had no positive blood cx (no
   sputum cx sent). She does has bilateral pleural effusions noted on
   chest x-ray which appear to be improvong. Respiratory status improved,
   pt sat'ing 100% on RA at this time. Pt with peripheral edema on exam.
   - continue vanc/zosyn x 21 day course (currently day #3)
   - continue ipratropium nebs
   - continue lasix 40 mg IV daily
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - stricts I/O's
   - agree with primary team to hold off on tapping pleural effusions at
   this time
   .
   # Abdominal Abscess: S/p drainage. On vanc/zosyn. Recent CT scan
   showing resolution of fluid collections, with only a small amount of
   free fluid in the pelvis. Colocutaneous fistula draining feculant fluid
   on lower abdomen; however, pt's nutritional status to poor to fix this
   at this point.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - continue to monitor fever curve
   - continue to monitor abdominal exam
   .
   # Diffuse Edema: Likely related to poor nutritional status, with
   albumin of 1.8.
   - continue tube feeds
   - appreciate nutrition recs
   - continue lasix, as above
   - PM lytes
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Pt with dementia. Not clear what her baseline
   is, however. Currently, she is somnolent but responds to verbal
   stimuli.
   - Holding aricept for concern of causing bradycardia
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - touch base with family re: baseline mental status
   - reorientation, maintain sleep/wake cycle
   .
   # HTN: Normotensive on exam.
   - conmtinue valsartan 80 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, aspirin 81 mg
   - continue to monitor blood pressure and fluid status
   .
   # DM: On ISS. Continue to monitor blood glucose.

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), dementia, diverticulosis with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), initially admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) with an abdominal abscess thought to be a perforated diverticulum, now status post incision and drainage (I&D). She developed post-operative respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient also has tachy-brady syndrome, with episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia, and is awaiting pacemaker placement. She has diffuse edema likely related to poor nutritional status, an altered mental status, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to either congestive heart failure (CHF) or aspiration pneumonia (PNA). Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is essential. It is important to ensure strict input/output monitoring and continue with appropriate antibiotics, bronchodilators, and diuretics as per the treatment plan.

2. Tachy-brady Syndrome: The patient has episodes of both tachycardia and bradycardia, which are causing labile heart rates."
