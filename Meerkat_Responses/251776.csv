   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M found down, with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute
   renal failure and profound acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - Obtain ABG
   - Decrease FIO2
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK [**Numeric Identifier 5119**] and found down.  Not reportedly on
   statin or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely
   etiology, being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Given 1L D5W with 150 mEq HCO3 now
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   .
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - EEG to r/o occult seizure
   - Consider Neuro consult
   - Final read head CT
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Increased Osm gap to 17, but not
   greater than 25.  Likely related to alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic
   acidosis and the presence of alcohol can alter the assay.
   - Renal
   .
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.
   - Agressive IVF as above
   - Bicarbonate as above
   - Renal consult
   - UA, lytes
   - Urine pH
   .
   #  Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia,
   alcohol intoxication or viral etiology.
   - Trend
   - IVF as above
   - Consider further work-up with viral etiology should it worsen
   - RUQ u/s
   .
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be due to infection (PNA, biliary), aspiration
   pneumonitis or seizures. Blood cultures pending, UA at OSH negative.
   Given Levofloxacin / Zosyn in ED, which is correct empiric therapy for
   CAP requiring ICU admission.
   - Continue Levo 250mg IV (renally dosed)
   - Zosyn IV
   - Follow-up blood cultures / UCx
   - CXR in AM
   - RUQ u/s with doppler
   - EEG

   # Coffee ground emesis: Concern for this upon admission to OSH.  Guaiac
   negative here.
   - Serial Hct
   - CVL
   - T&C
   - Transfuse < 30
   .
   # Central Arterial line: Left subclavian line in artery.  Vascular
   consulted, to leave in place and pull in OR once more clinically
   stable.
   - Per vascular, leave in place

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male who was found down and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and profound acidosis. He also has respiratory failure, transaminitis, leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and possible coffee ground emesis.

The patient is on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen lines, and has an arterial line in his left subclavian artery. He is receiving various medications including midazolam, insulin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofoxacin. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/53 to 142/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. His blood glucose level is also elevated at 288 mg/dL. The patient's ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis with compensation and metabolic acidosis.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to pneumonia or other infections, further deterioration of renal function, development of liver failure, and potential cardiovascular complications due to electrolyte imbalances and the presence of an arterial line."

","The patient is a 67-year-old male found down with a history of alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and profound acidosis. The patient has several medical complications that require attention.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to obtunded mental status and concern for pneumonia on chest X-ray. An arterial blood gas (ABG) should be obtained, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) should be decreased.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and was found down. This condition is likely resolved since the patient is now clinically stable. Monitoring of serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine should be done.

3. Alcohol-Related Metabolic Abnormalities (AMS): The patient's initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3, indicating altered mental status. Previous episodes of AMS occurred after seizures and subtherapeutic phenytoin administration. The patient may still be at risk for non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Versed should be continued for sedation, and the possibility of delirium tremens (DTs) should be treated. An electroencephalogram (EEG) should be performed to rule out occult seizure. A neurology consultation may be necessary.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has multifactorial metabolic acidosis related to acute renal failure with ure"

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree with
   the assessment and plan as above with the following
   emphasis/modifications:
   67 year old male history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who
   presents after being found down for unknown period of time.  Had GCS of
   3 and was intubated and brought to outside hospital.   HCT/neck CT
   negative and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**].
   Overnight, has been hypotensive on levophed and also in rhabdo, ARF
   receiving bicarb drip and volume resuscitation.  Also, note a
   subclavian line was placed by outside hospital into his subclavian
   artery.
   Labs as noted above and CXR with ETT in good position and no
   significant infiltrates.
   PE 98  120  BP 112/70 RR  18   Sat 98%
   Lactate 3.7
   Urine output now about 80cc/hour
   Still requiring levophed
   1)  Shock: probable sepsis but other etiologies possible and will
   obtain ECHO to help further discern.  Assuming septic shock, it is
   unclear of the source but could include abdominal, pneumonia
   2) Respiratory Failure
   3) Acidosis
   4) Rhabdomyolysis
   5) Acute Renal Failure
   6) Alcohol Abuse
   7) Malpositioned line in subclavian artery
   Plan:
   1) Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/levo)
   2) CT scan to rule out abd source
   3) Place RIJ when feasible (need to rule repeat neck CT to rule
   fracture since no outside images available and then will place line)
   4) Vascular surgery for issue of malpositioned line
   5) Volume resuscitation for shock and rhabdo
 follow perfusion
   endpoints
   6) Thiamine
   Addendum: during the day, patient blood cultures grew gram negative
   bacteria futher emphasizing the need for abd ct scan to evaluate for
   source.  Given persistent hemodynamic instability and confirmed gram
   negatives, we will give a dose of gentamycin believing the benefit of
   using this [**Doctor Last Name **] for this life-threatening gram
 septic shock
   outweighs the nephrotoxic risk.
   Critical Care Time: 40 minutes
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2187-1-24**] 17:27 ------
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who was found down with empty alcohol bottles around him. He presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 and was intubated. Initial laboratory results showed an elevated blood alcohol level of 403 mg/dL and metabolic acidosis. A head CT scan and cervical spine imaging were negative, and a subclavian line was placed. The patient has been hypotensive and developed rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. He required vasopressor support with levophed and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include shock (probable septic shock), respiratory failure, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, alcohol abuse, and a malpositioned line in the subclavian artery. 

The plan includes obtaining an abdominal CT scan to rule out the source of sepsis, placing a right internal jugular (RIJ) line when feasible, consulting vascular surgery for the issue of the malpositioned line, volume resuscitation for shock and rhabdomyolysis, and following perfusion endpoints. Additionally, thiamine supplementation is recommended due to the patient's history of alcohol abuse."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shock, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF). He has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with multiple medical complications. 

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable with a temperature of 102.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 139/65mmHg to 83/51mmHg, heart rate between 76-132 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

Initial lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with high levels of potassium and low levels of magnesium and calcium. Liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver injury. 

The patient's chest X-ray reveals air-fluid levels in the sinuses, which suggests acute-on-chronic sinusitis. A CT scan of the torso shows colitis and sigmoid colon consolidation, indicating possible gastrointestinal involvement. The CT scan of the cervical spine is negative for fractures. 

The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Gentamicin, Piperacillin, and Metronidazole. He is also receiving fluids, sedatives, and other supportive care measures.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M found down, with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute
   renal failure and profound acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - GPC in sputum, on vanco
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK [**Numeric Identifier 5119**] and found down.  Not reportedly on
   statin or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely
   etiology, being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Aggressive hydration
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   - CK trending down
   .
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - EEG to r/o occult seizure
   - Consider Neuro consult
   - Final read head CT: no acute findings on final read
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Increased Osm gap to 17, but not
   greater than 25.  Likely related to alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic
   acidosis and the presence of alcohol can alter the assay.
   -          Good UPO with hydration
   -
   .
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.
   - Agressive IVF as above
   - Bicarbonate as above
   - Renal consult
   - UA, lytes
   - Urine pH
   .
   #  Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia,
   alcohol intoxication or viral etiology.
   - Trend
   - IVF as above
   - Consider further work-up with viral etiology should it worsen
   - RUQ u/s
   .
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be due to infection (PNA, biliary), aspiration
   pneumonitis or seizures. Blood cultures pending, UA at OSH negative.
   Given Levofloxacin / Zosyn in ED, which is correct empiric therapy for
   CAP requiring ICU admission.
   - Continue Levo 250mg IV (renally dosed)
   - Zosyn IV
   - Follow-up blood cultures / UCx
   - CXR in AM
   - RUQ u/s with doppler
   - EEG
   .
   # Elevated
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis: Concern for this upon admission to OSH.  Guaiac
   negative here.
   - Serial Hct
   - CVL
   - T&C
   - Transfuse < 30
   .
   # Central Arterial line: Left subclavian line in artery.  Vascular
   consulted, to leave in place and pull in OR once more clinically
   stable.
   - Per vascular, leave in place

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male found down with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and profound acidosis. He has respiratory failure secondary to obtunded mental status and concern for pneumonia on chest x-ray. The patient also has elevated CK levels indicative of rhabdomyolysis, which is likely due to being found down. He is being aggressively hydrated and monitored for serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine. There is a concern for alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and occult infection. The patient's metabolic acidosis is multifactorial, related to ARF with uremia, lactic acidosis, and alcoholic ketoacidosis. He has acute renal failure with a likely multifactorial etiology. The patient's transaminitis could be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia, alcohol intoxication, or viral etiology. Leukocytosis could be due to infection, aspiration pneumonitis, or seizures. The patient has coffee ground emesis with a negative guaiac test. A central arterial line has been placed in the left subclavian artery, and it will be left in place until the patient is more clinically stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to obtunded mental status and concern for pneumonia on chest x-ray. Weaning off the ventilator as tolerated should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M found down, with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute
   renal failure and profound acidosis
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis.  Initially thought due to infection (PNA,
   biliary), aspiration pneumonitis or seizures. Blood cultures pending,
   UA at OSH negative.  Given Levofloxacin / Zosyn in ED, which is correct
   empiric therapy for CAP requiring ICU admission.  Continued  on Levo
   250mg IV (renally dosed) & Zosyn IV.
   - Blood cx: GNR, GPC
   - Sputum cx: GPC
   - Levaquin d/c'd
   - Follow-up blood cultures / UCx
   - CXR in AM
   - Confirm final read CT abdomen, ?biliary tract involvement
   - Current antibiotics include: Vancomycin, Zosyn, Gentamicin,
   Metronidazole
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - GPC in sputum, on vanco
   - Wean vent as tolerated, will hold until pulling of subclavian A-line
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK [**Numeric Identifier 5119**] and found down.  Not reportedly on
   statin or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely
   etiology, being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Aggressive hydration with NS/LR
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   - CK trending down
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - Final read head CT: no acute findings on final read
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Increased Osm gap to 17, but not
   greater than 25.  Likely related to alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic
   acidosis and the presence of alcohol can alter the assay.  Anion gap
   has closed.
   - Good UPO with hydration
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.
   - Agressive IVF as above
   - Bicarbonate as above
   - Renal consult appreciated
   #  Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia,
   alcohol intoxication or viral etiology.  But AST elevated most
   prominently so could all be [**12-18**] muscle breakdown from rhabdomyolysis.
   - IVF as above
   - Consider further work-up with viral etiology should it worsen
   # Coffee ground emesis: Concern for this upon admission to OSH.  Guaiac
   negative here.
   - Serial Hct
   - CVL
   - T&C
   # Central Arterial line: Left subclavian line in artery.  Vascular
   consulted, to leave in place and pull in OR once more clinically
   stable.
   - Per vascular, plan to pull today
   # Pancolitis: Seen on CT scan.  Likely [**12-18**] C.diff for other enteric
   pathogen.  No known exposure to antibiotics.
   - Flagyl / Zosyn
   - Add on po Vanco
   FEN: Euvolemic / electrolyte abnormalities as above, hypernatremia
   today will increase free water / NPO

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 67-year-old male found down with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and profound acidosis. He was initially thought to have sepsis due to infection (pneumonia, biliary), aspiration pneumonitis, or seizures. Blood cultures are pending, and urinalysis at OSH was negative. Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated in the emergency department, which included Levofloxacin and Zosyn, and this is considered correct for community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU admission. The patient continues on Levo 250mg IV (renally dosed) and Zosyn IV.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with the possibility of pneumonia on chest X-ray. There is also a concern for respiratory failure secondary to obtunded mental status. The plan includes weaning off the ventilator as tolerated, holding until pulling the subclavian arterial line, and continuing with GPC in sputum while on vancomycin.

Rhabdomyolysis is present, with elevated CK levels, likely due to being found down. No other medication that would worsen this condition is reported. Aggressive hydration with normal saline/lactated Ringer's is recommended, along with monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine. The CK levels are trending down.

The patient has altered mental status with a previous history of seizures and had subtherapeutic phenytoin. No seizure"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They were admitted to the ICU for airway protection and have been intubated initially. The patient has suspected severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, possibly caused by C. diff pancolitis. They are currently on antibiotics including zosyn, flagyl, and IV vancomycin, with gentamicin being added. The patient also has acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's suspected severe sepsis with organ dysfunction requires immediate attention. It is important to identify the causative bug and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection and will need ongoing monitoring and management of their respiratory status.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's good urine output suggests that their rhabdomyolysis is being managed appropriately with crystalloid infusion.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels were initially well controlled with insulin, but they were later switched to dextrose 50% when off insulin.
5. Ethanol Intoxication: The patient is at risk for delirium tremens on midazolam (versed) and should be monitored for this. CIWA scale can be used to assess withdrawal symptoms.

   24 Hour Events:
   Head CT read was an old finding. [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was appropriate. Given
   vanco/zosyn/gent, flagyl. Switched to NS. Good uop. Trop went from 0.06
   to 0.19, CK coming down. CT torso showed diffuse colitis. Surgery was
   called to evaluate him, and felt no urgent intervention needed at this
   time. Given vit K. Going to cath lab today for SCL removal from artery.
   Switched to neo for tachycardia. RIJ placed and groin line pulled.
   On/off small amount of neo this am. CVsat initially 43% up to 64% with

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M found down, with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute
   renal failure and profound acidosis
   # Sepsis: Source likely intra-abd (colitis on scan) vs PNA.
   - Blood cx: GNR, GPC
   - Sputum cx: GPC
   - Follow-up blood cultures / UCx
   - CXR in AM
   - Confirm final read CT abdomen, ?biliary tract involvement
   - Current antibiotics include: Vancomycin, Zosyn, Gentamicin,
   Metronidazole
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - GPC in sputum, on vanco
   - Wean vent as tolerated, possible extubation today
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK and found down.  Not reportedly on statin
   or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely etiology,
   being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Aggressive hydration with NS/LR
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   - CK trending down
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - Final read head CT: no acute findings on final read
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Gap closed.  Likely related to
   alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis and the presence of alcohol can
   alter the assay.
   - Good UPO with hydration
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   # Hx Sz disorder: Restarted anti-sz meds now that off versed.
   - Sz meds
   - Monitor for sz activity
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.  Creat improving.
   - IVf
   - Bicarbonate s/p cath lab intervention
   - Renal consult appreciated
   #  Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia,
   alcohol intoxication or viral etiology.  But AST elevated most
   prominently so could all be [**12-18**] muscle breakdown from rhabdomyolysis.
   - Consider further work-up with viral etiology should it worsen
   # Coffee ground emesis: Concern for this upon admission to OSH.  Guaiac
   negative here.
   - Serial Hct
   # Central Arterial line: Left subclavian line in artery, now removed by
   vasc.
   - Follow groin access site
   - Vascular following
   # Pancolitis: Seen on CT scan.  Likely [**12-18**] C.diff for other enteric
   pathogen.  No known exposure to antibiotics.
   - Flagyl / Zosyn
   - Add on po Vanco

   - Confirm final read CT abdomen, ?biliary tract involvement
   - Current antibiotics include: Vancomycin, Zosyn, Gentamicin,
   Metronidazole
   - can check a gent level, if low, can redose once more and await
   speciation.
   - call micro for speciation
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - GPC in sputum, on vanco
   - Wean vent as tolerated, possible extubation today
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK and found down.  Not reportedly on statin
   or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely etiology,
   being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Aggressive hydration with NS/LR
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   - CK trending down
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - Final read head CT: no acute findings on final read
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Gap closed.  Likely related to
   alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis and the presence of alcohol can
   alter the assay.
   - Good UPO with hydration
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   # Hx Sz disorder: Restarted anti-sz meds now that off versed.
   - Sz meds
   - Monitor for sz activity
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.  Creat improving.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is septic shock, rhabdo, and renal failure. The patient is a 67-year-old male found down with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and profound acidosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a suspected intra-abdominal source of infection (colitis on scan) or pneumonia (PNA). Blood cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started. 
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to obtunded mental status and concern for pneumonia. Weaning off the ventilator may be attempted as tolerated.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated CK levels and was found down. Aggressive hydration is being administered, and serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine are being monitored.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for alcohol withdrawal due to recent alcohol use. Sedation with midazolam (Versed) is being provided, and seizure precautions are in place.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has multifactorial metabolic acidosis related to acute renal failure, lactic acidosis, and alcoholic ketoacidosis. Good urine output with hydration is being maintained.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, alcohol abuse, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, gentamicin, vancomycin, metronidazole), sedatives (midazolam), pain relief (fentanyl), and antacids (pantoprazole).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a possible source of infection, including GBS pneumonia, colitis, and GNR bacteremia. Monitoring gentamicin levels is necessary, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued. Further identification of the specific GNR bacterium is required.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has improved, with a clear lung examination and good oxygenation. Extubation may be considered once the patient's neurological status stabilizes.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis was initially improving but requires continued monitoring of urine output.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient should be monitored for signs of ethanol withdrawal, and valium can be administered as needed.
5. Seizure Disorder: The patient's seizure disorder should be managed with continued administration of depakote.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree with
   the assessment and plan as above with the following
   emphasis/modifications:
   67 year old male history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who
   presents after being found down for unknown period of time.  Had GCS of
   3 and was intubated and brought to outside hospital.   HCT/neck CT
   negative and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**].
   Yesterday, found to have both gram negatives and gram positives in
   blood.  Was hypotensive and on pressors but now resuscitated and
   improved with good urine output and lactate cleared.  However, mental
   status this morning slightly depressed as just coming off versed today.
   PE T 36.1  P 94  BP 112/70 RR  18   Sat 98%
   Lactate 1.4
   - CT scan with colitis, enlarged gluteal muscle
   Urine output 30-50 cc/hour
   1) Septic Shock
 polymicrobial (gram negatives, gram positives in
   blood
staph coag negative)
 source likely translocation from gut as
   patient has diffuse colitis and staph may be from line although will
   discuss with surgery if could be from gluteal muscles
   2) Colitis
 surgery following
   3) Respiratory Failure
   4) Acidosis
   5) Rhabdomyolysis
   6) Acute Renal Failure
   7) Alcohol Abuse
   8) Malpositioned line in subclavian artery
   Plan:
   1) Continue Zosyn/vancomycin/flagyl
   2) Surgery following for colitis and gluteal muscle swelling (?
   Myositis)
   3) Remove right subclavian malpositioned line in cath lab per vascular
   4) Will plan extubation when mental status improves
 likely secondary
   to sedation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who presents after being found down for an unknown period of time. The patient has been critically ill and has experienced several medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient has a possible source of GBS pneumonia, colitis, and GNR bacteremia, leading to sepsis. Antibiotics have been started, and further investigation is needed to identify the specific pathogen.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had acute respiratory failure but has shown improvement. The plan is to hold Versed and consider extubation once the patient's mental status improves.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient was initially improving but now requires close monitoring of urine output and continued administration of IV fluids.

4. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient should be monitored for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and Valium can be administered as needed.

5. Seizure Disorder: The patient is currently on Depakote to manage seizure disorder.

6. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are plateauing, and the cause may be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis. Monitoring urine output and checking gentamicin levels are recommended.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, and DIC labs, clarification of recent heparin use"
