   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient with apparent hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.
   - Restart vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to optimize
   respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG.
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial presentation.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers.
   - TTE as above
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - Surface echocardiogram today.
   - Hold off on lasix pending determination of etiology to hypotension
   (cardiogenic versus distributive versus mixed).
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - Consider right heart cath to determine filling pressures and PCWP.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.
   - Telemetry
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.
   - Calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicarb, and kayexalate.
   - Repeat ECG.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos.
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis.
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - Increase minute ventilation as above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed today
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient with possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Consider restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 50%,PEEP 18 -> will
   wean PEEP incrementally as able
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.
   - Telemetry, sinus tach;
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.8, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos.
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - Increase minute ventilation as above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the hospital with hypotension and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's condition has been complex and challenging, with multiple medical complications. These include cardiogenic shock, mixed respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, transaminitis, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and pulmonary edema suggest possible cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis and left ventricular dysfunction.
2. Mixed respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be due to excessive volume overload, worsened mitral regurgitation, or aspiration event.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has significant TnT elevation, ECG changes, and left main or proximal LAD ischemia. This indicates potential coronary artery disease requiring revascularization.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and abnormal urinalysis suggest acute renal failure, which may be due to end organ damage in the setting of shock or contrast-induced nephropathy.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which could be secondary to recent blood transfusions or rhabdomyolysis.
6. Transaminitis:"

   4. Abnormal perfusion of the kidneys bilaterally likely relates to the
   phase of enhancement and repeated contrast administration.
   5. Diverticulosis. No evidence for diverticulitis
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed today
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient with possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Consider restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 50%,PEEP 18 -> will
   wean PEEP incrementally as able
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.
   - Telemetry, sinus tach;
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.8, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos.
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - Increase minute ventilation as above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring intermittent use of levophed to maintain blood pressure. There is uncertainty regarding the exact cause of hypotension, with possible etiologies including cardiogenic shock, distributive shock due to sepsis/SIRS physiology, or medications. A bedside echo showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, but with an unknown baseline. A repeat TTE showed a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%, with infero-septal, inferior, and infero-lateral akinesis. There is also mild dilation of the right ventricle with global hypokinesis. Moderate aortic stenosis was noted, with a valve area of 1.0-1.2 cm2, and mild aortic regurgitation.

The patient has been treated with aggressive diuresis using lasix, goal-directed fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic therapy for suspected aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis. The patient's mixed respiratory failure has improved with ventilation strategies and weaning of FiO2 and PEEP. Coronary angiography revealed significant lesions in the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery (LAD), and circumflex artery (LCx). No revascularization was performed due to the patient's"

The patient is a 67-inch, 91 kg male admitted to the ICU with hypotension. The patient's history is not obtainable as he is sedated. Allergies are not reported. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 106/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, and blood cultures have been sent.

The patient underwent an echocardiogram showing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% with regional wall motion abnormalities indicative of coronary artery disease (CAD) and moderate aortic stenosis. A cardiac catheterization revealed critical lesions in the left main coronary artery (LMCA), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and circumflex artery (LCx), with the RCA being a large ectatic vessel with multiple lesions. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was deemed not appropriate due to the patient's pulmonary status.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning given signs of end
   organ perfusion including elevated creatinine, LFTs, and cardiac
   biomarkers.  Potential etiologies include cardiogenic shock or
   distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology, anaphylaxis in setting
   of receiving blood products, or medications.  Bedside echo by
   cardiology fellow in ED did not show decreased LVEF but with moderate
   to severe MR with unknown baseline, which if new could be the etiology
   to patient's symptoms.  In addition, volume rescucitation in setting of
   suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs and 3L IVF could also have
   caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and
   pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.  SIRS/sepsis could be
   in the setting of aspiration event during emergent intubation or
   TRALI.
   - Treat as sepsis with EGDT for now. Maintain MAP>65, CVP>12
   (intubated), ScVO2>70, monitor UOP with goal>30 cc/hr. Recheck lactate.
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and pip/tazo pending sputum cultures. Can likely discontinue in 24-48
   hours when infectious process ruled out.
   - Obtain blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top.
   - Formal TTE in AM to assess for valvular disease, LVEF, and wall
   motion abnormalities.
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient with apparent hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.
   - Restart vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to optimize
   respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG.
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial presentation.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers.
   - TTE as above
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - Surface echocardiogram today.
   - Hold off on lasix pending determination of etiology to hypotension
   (cardiogenic versus distributive versus mixed).
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - Consider right heart cath to determine filling pressures and PCWP.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.
   - Telemetry
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.
   - Calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicarb, and kayexalate.
   - Repeat ECG.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos.
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis.
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - Increase minute ventilation as above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the CCU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient has been hypotensive since arrival, requiring intermittent levophed. There are concerns about end organ perfusion, including elevated creatinine, LFTs, and cardiac biomarkers. The patient may have experienced aspiration pneumonia or TRALI. He is being treated as sepsis with EGDT and also for possible heart failure. The patient's respiratory failure is due to mixed causes, including hypoxia and hypercarbia. There are concerns about coronary artery disease, specifically left main or proximal LAD ischemia. The patient's BNP level indicates decompensated heart failure. He has hyperkalemia, transaminitis, acute renal failure, and acidosis. There are also concerns about leukocytosis and a possible ruptured AAA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and pulmonary edema suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which could be caused by severe heart dysfunction or valvular disease.
2. Sepsis/SIRS: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers indicate an infectious process. This could be due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or another source of infection.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and bilateral"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed today
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient with possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Consider restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 50%,PEEP 18 -> will
   wean PEEP incrementally as able
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.
   - Telemetry, sinus tach;
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.8, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos.
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - Increase minute ventilation as above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","The patient's chief complaint is hypotension. The patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation/sinus tachycardia, which spontaneously converted at times. Cardioversion was attempted with 250 joules but was unsuccessful. The patient was on Lasix and levophed, but these have been discontinued. The patient has been sedated and unable to obtain any information from them.

The vital signs show a temperature of 38.6 C (101.4 F), a heart rate of 98 bpm with a range of 95-149 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/69 mmHg to 75/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 26 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and compliance of 66.7 cmH2O/mL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 398, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 27, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 199, base excess of -7, and lactate of 2.2 mmol/L.

The physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal pupils, normocephalic head, normal cardiovascular examination with no murmurs, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion note, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, no lower extremity edema, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.3 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 160 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T of 9.06 ng/mL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 908 IU/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

Imaging shows diffuse airspace disease that has improved but with small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.

The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and septic shock. The patient is receiving ICU care with arterial and multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and measures to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows -> done
   - goal Is/Os even today, ensure UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**3-31**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed today -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient with possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Consider restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 50%, PEEP 10 -> will
   wean PEEP incrementally as able
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will
   stop cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Now has evidence of
   a.flutter.
   - Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion yesterday, will attempt again today on 12
   lead
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern today with 9
   point drop in Hct.  Will repeat Hct, consider repeat CT abdomen
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   - CT CAP non-contrast, transfuse 2 units PRBCs today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.8, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos.
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved, pt has primary metabolic alkalosis
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - decrease minute ventilation as able
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital due to persistent hypotension and difficulty in ventilation.

Upon admission, the patient was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s, and required intermittent administration of levophed. The etiology of hypotension is unclear, but potential causes include cardiogenic shock, distributive shock, or volume overload due to recent dynamic changes or unstable abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

The patient also presented with mixed respiratory failure, characterized by hypoxia and hypercarbia. This was initially attributed to excessive volume overload and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR), but may also be related to a transfusion reaction or aspiration event. The patient's oxygenation and ventilation have improved with aggressive diuresis.

Cardiac biomarkers showed significant elevation, suggesting myocardial injury. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated dynamic changes concerning for left main or proximal left anterior descending (LAD) ischemia. However, subsequent ECGs showed largely resolved ST-segment elevation with persistent STD anterolaterally and a new leftward axis. A left heart catheterization was performed, revealing multi-vessel coronary artery disease, and the patient may require revascularization in the future.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable with episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter, requiring multiple interventions. He has required intermittent levophed for hypotension, and his respiratory status has improved with aggressive diuresis. The patient's cardiac biomarkers indicate possible myocardial injury, and he is being evaluated for potential coronary revascularization. Other issues include acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, transaminitis, and leukocytosis. The patient's prognosis is critical due to multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of moderate to severe aortic stenosis, acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF, and myocardial injury suggests the possibility of cardiogenic shock.
2. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA): The patient's hypotension and recent dynamic changes in his medical condition raise concerns for a possible ruptured AAA.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and urea nitrogen indicate renal dysfunction. It is crucial to monitor his renal function closely.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to consumptive coagulopathy or he"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows -> done
   - goal Is/Os even today, ensure UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**3-31**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed today -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient with possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Consider restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 50%, PEEP 10 -> will
   wean PEEP incrementally as able
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will
   stop cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   - consider repeat TTE today
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Now has evidence of
   a.flutter.
   - Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion yesterday, will attempt again today on 12
   lead
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern today with 9
   point drop in Hct.  Will repeat Hct, consider repeat CT abdomen
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   - CT CAP non-contrast, transfuse 2 units PRBCs today
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.8, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos.
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved, pt has primary metabolic alkalosis
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - decrease minute ventilation
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. He presented with hypotension in the emergency department and required intermittent levophed support. The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology, or unstable abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). There is a possibility of volume overload leading to pulmonary edema and decreased cardiac output.

The patient also has mixed respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia. His oxygenation and ventilation have improved with aggressive diuresis. He is currently on assist control ventilation with a goal to wean FiO2 and PEEP.

There are concerns regarding the patient's coronary arteries, as he has significant TnT elevation and dynamic changes on ECG. Left heart cath results showed mild to moderate coronary artery disease. The patient may require revascularization in the future.

The patient appears to have decompensated heart failure with elevated BNP levels and pulmonary edema. TTE and right heart cath are planned to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function.

The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction but has evidence of atrial flutter. Telemetry is being monitored, and DC cardioversion will be attempted again today.

The patient does not currently appear to have a ruptured AAA, but there are concerns about"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning given signs of end
   organ perfusion including elevated creatinine, LFTs, and cardiac
   biomarkers.  Potential etiologies include cardiogenic shock or
   distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology, anaphylaxis in setting
   of receiving blood products, or medications.  Bedside echo by
   cardiology fellow in ED did not show decreased LVEF but with moderate
   to severe MR with unknown baseline, which if new could be the etiology
   to patient's symptoms.  In addition, volume rescucitation in setting of
   suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs and 3L IVF could also have
   caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and
   pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.  SIRS/sepsis could be
   in the setting of aspiration event during emergent intubation or
   TRALI.
   - Treat as sepsis with EGDT for now. Maintain MAP>65, CVP>12
   (intubated), ScVO2>70, monitor UOP with goal>30 cc/hr. Recheck lactate.
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   vanco, cefipime, flagyl pending sputum cultures. Can likely discontinue
   in 24-48 hours when infectious process ruled out.
   - Obtain blood cultures and sputum cultures
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top.
   - Formal TTE in AM to assess for valvular disease, LVEF, and wall
   motion abnormalities.
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient with apparent hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.
   - Restart vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to optimize
   respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG.
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial presentation.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers.
   - TTE as above
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - Surface echocardiogram today.
   - Hold off on lasix pending determination of etiology to hypotension
   (cardiogenic versus distributive versus mixed).
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - Consider right heart cath to determine filling pressures and PCWP.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.
   - Telemetry
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.
   - Calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicarb, and kayexalate.
   - Repeat ECG.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos.
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis.
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - Increase minute ventilation as above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and septic shock. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.1 F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/73 mmHg to 135/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. Blood cultures were obtained on 10/18/2108 at 03:45 AM, 04:06 AM, 07:39 AM, 07:54 AM, 12:20 PM, 03:12 PM, and 07:26 PM. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells and diuresis with 40 IV Lasix. Imaging studies, including a CT torso, have been performed and show no evidence of bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma if the ventilator settings are not adjusted properly."

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension. The patient has a history of intermittent dyspnea on exertion for 2-3 weeks prior to admission. Vital signs show a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 133/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on FiO2 of 0.4, and temperature of 37.9°C. The patient is sedated and unable to assess neurological status. 

Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals a stable infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm without evidence of leak or rupture, no intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hematoma to explain the drop in hematocrit, stranding of subcutaneous tissues in the right groin consistent with recent cardiac catheterization, improved aeration of dependent lungs with moderate persistent atelectasis or consolidation, small bilateral pleural effusions, calcified pleura consistent with prior asbestos exposure, and diverticulosis without diverticulitis. 

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), aortic aneurysm without rupture, and septic shock. The patient is receiving amiodarone infusion, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient's condition is unstable, and there are potential medical complications such as worsening respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows -> done
   - pt was net (-) 500 cc on [**2108-10-18**], now (-) 1.5 liters this morning.
   Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-1**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures cultures -> still pending
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Considered restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will
   stop cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Now has evidence of
   a.flutter.
   - Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO after gtt finished
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern today with 9
   point drop in Hct.  Will repeat Hct, CT abdomen showed no changes in
   AAA, no RP bleed, no obvious source of blood loss
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   - CT CAP non-contrast, transfuse 2 units PRBCs yesterday -> good
   response, Hct now 36

   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 113
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.5, also encouraging

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including unstable abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, transaminitis, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to require aggressive diuresis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Further diagnostic tests and interventions are planned to manage his complex medical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ruptured AAA: The patient has an unstable AAA, which could potentially rupture and lead to life-threatening internal bleeding.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and signs of heart failure suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock due to the AMI.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which can be caused by various factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.
4. Infection: The leukocytosis and low-grade fever may indicate an infectious process, potentially leading to pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows -> done
   - pt was net (-) 500 cc on [**2108-10-18**], now (-) 1.5 liters this morning.
   Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-1**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures cultures -> still pending
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Considered restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will
   stop cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Now has evidence of
   a.flutter.
   - Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO after gtt finished
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern today with 9
   point drop in Hct.  Will repeat Hct, CT abdomen showed no changes in
   AAA, no RP bleed, no obvious source of blood loss
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   - CT CAP non-contrast, transfuse 2 units PRBCs yesterday -> good
   response, Hct now 36
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 113
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.5, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.

   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved, pt has primary metabolic alkalosis
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - decrease minute ventilation as able
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   Leukocytosis has resolved, low grade temp cont, will check B/C, urine

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's hypotension has been persistent and has required intermittent administration of levophed. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear, but it is concerning for unstable abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), possible recent dynamic changes, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.

The patient's respiratory failure is mixed in nature, initially presenting as hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. This could be due to excessive volume overload during volume resuscitation, worsened mitral regurgitation (MR), or a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation and ventilation after aggressive diuresis.

The patient also has significant TnT elevation, indicating myocardial injury. ECG changes initially suggested left main or proximal left anterior descending (LAD) ischemia, but have largely resolved. The left heart catheterization showed no significant coronary artery disease. The possibility of revascularization in the future will be considered if the patient improves clinically.

The patient has signs of decompensated heart failure, as evidenced by pulmonary edema, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 2769, and elevated filling pressures and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows -> done
   - pt was net (-) 500 cc on [**2108-10-18**], now (-) 1.5 liters this morning.
   Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-1**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures cultures -> still pending
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Considered restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will
   stop cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Now has evidence of
   a.flutter.
   - Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO after gtt finished
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern today with 9
   point drop in Hct.  Will repeat Hct, CT abdomen showed no changes in
   AAA, no RP bleed, no obvious source of blood loss
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   - CT CAP non-contrast, transfuse 2 units PRBCs yesterday -> good
   response, Hct now 36
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 113
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.5, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved, pt has primary metabolic alkalosis
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - decrease minute ventilation as able
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   Leukocytosis has resolved, low grade temp cont, will check B/C, urine
   cx today
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient was initially hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 80s, and required intermittent levophed support. The etiology of hypotension is unclear, but potential causes include cardiogenic shock, distributive shock, or unstable abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). 

The patient also presented with mixed respiratory failure, initially showing hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Oxygenation and ventilation have improved with aggressive diuresis and volume-cycled assist control ventilation. 

There is a concern for coronary artery disease, indicated by elevated troponin T levels and dynamic changes on electrocardiogram (ECG), suggesting possible left main or proximal left anterior descending artery ischemia. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.4. There is also evidence of hyperkalemia, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's current condition includes sinus rhythm with intermittent atrial flutter, pulmonary edema, and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration. 

Further assessments and plans include aggressive diuresis to manage volume overload, continued respiratory support, close monitoring of cardiac biomarkers, and consultation with vascular surgery regarding the AAA."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows -> done
   - pt was net (-) 500 cc on [**2108-10-18**], now (-) 1.5 liters this morning.
   Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-1**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures cultures -> still pending
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Considered restarting vecuronium with adequate sedation in order to
   optimize respiratory mechanics
   - Continue volume-cycled assist control with goal to increase minute
   ventilation to blow off CO2 and wean FiO2 and PEEP.  If patient remains
   difficult to oxygenate may require continued paralytics and APRV.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, BB given hypotension and concern
   for ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will
   stop cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Now has evidence of
   a.flutter.
   - Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO after gtt finished
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern today with 9
   point drop in Hct.  Will repeat Hct, CT abdomen showed no changes in
   AAA, no RP bleed, no obvious source of blood loss
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   - CT CAP non-contrast, transfuse 2 units PRBCs yesterday -> good
   response, Hct now 36
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 113
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Uncertain etiology at this time, although patient with
   normal serum potassium level at OSH. This may be in setting of 5 units
   PRBC transfusion. Patient did not receive succinylcholine for RSI.
   Alternatively, this could be rhabdomyolysis given elevated
   transaminases and ARF in setting of statin therapy, although this
   appears less likely. ECG with concerning changes including peaked T
   waves V1-3 and borderline prolonged PR interval.  Now resolved, pt
   requiring K+ in setting of significant UOP
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.5, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved, pt has primary metabolic alkalosis
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - decrease minute ventilation as able
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   Leukocytosis has resolved, low grade temp cont, will check B/C, urine
   cx today
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, mixed respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial flutter, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, transaminitis, acute renal failure, metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, and potential infectious processes.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and evidence of myocardial ischemia may indicate cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and possible infection could suggest the development of sepsis, a severe infection that can lead to organ dysfunction.

3. Ruptured AAA: The patient's unstable AAA and recent drop in hemoglobin levels raise concerns for a possible rupture of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is a life-threatening emergency.

4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and acute renal failure indicate a potential risk for further deterioration in kidney function, which may require dialysis or other interventions.

5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory failure and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
   # Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at
   transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to
   70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermitent levophed for
   first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning for
   unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies
   include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS
   physiology or medications.  In addition, volume rescucitation in
   setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs and 3L IVF likely
   has caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and
   pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.  SIRS/sepsis could be
   in the setting of aspiration event during emergent intubation or
   TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved, but need tight bp control given risk
   for AAA rupture.  - Initially aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg /
   hr.  Total LOS neg 5L
   - Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Patient has tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when
   repositioning - will use labetolol or nitro drip for goal MAP 70s
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - will attempt to wean down sedation today; may require nitro drip to
   control BP
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-31**]
   - f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**Last Name (LF) 10314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] culture daily if continues to spike
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will stop
   cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   - Now on labetalol drip, titrate to MAP in 70s.  Will consider using
   nitro drip if needed.
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   plan for monday
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or
   ACS.  Leukocytosis has resolved, low grade temp cont, will check B/C,
   urine cx today
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE showed EF 35%, infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis
   (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
   - continue diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter.
   - Cont Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO
 patient as been in sinus for 24 hours
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 113
 122
   - heme/onc consulted, recs appreciated
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.5, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the ICU with newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also had positive cardiac enzymes, ECG changes, and catheterization showing 3-vessel disease.

The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, with episodes of hypotension in the 70s/50s, requiring intermittent levophed for the first several days. This may be due to unstable AAA, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications. The patient has received 5 units of packed red blood cells and 3 liters of intravenous fluids, which may have caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure. The patient's hypotension is now resolved, but tight blood pressure control is necessary due to the risk of AAA rupture.

The patient initially had possible hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which improved after aggressive diuresis. The patient was difficult to ventilate in the emergency department, requiring vecuronium, and remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and breathstacking when not paralyzed. The patient's oxygenation and ventilation have improved markedly in the setting of aggressive diuresis.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are concerning"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old overweight/obese male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), aortic aneurysm without rupture, and septic shock. The patient has been febrile intermittently since admission, with temperatures ranging from 101.5 to 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics were initiated. The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped, possibly due to blood loss, dilution, and fluid shifts. The patient is receiving multiple medications including labetalol, fentanyl, midazolam, and others. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and pneumonia is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment for signs of DVT is important.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and the use of certain medications may increase the risk of stress ulcers. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding is essential.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Goal net (-) [**2-29**]
   liters today as BP, MAP, levophed allows -> done
   - pt was net (-) 500 cc on [**2108-10-18**], now (-) 1.5 liters this morning.
   Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-31**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures cultures -> still pending
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - will attempt to wean down sedation today; may require nitro drip to
   control BP
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, mixed respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, decompensated heart failure, rhythm disturbances, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, transaminitis, acute renal failure, metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent low blood pressure requires close monitoring and management to ensure adequate perfusion of vital organs.
2. Mixed Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has improved with aggressive diuresis but needs ongoing monitoring.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient shows evidence of myocardial ischemia and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating possible coronary artery disease. Further evaluation and consideration of revascularization may be necessary.
4. Decompensated Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure symptoms, such as pulmonary edema and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, suggest decompensated heart failure. Continued diuresis and optimization of cardiac function are essential.
5. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has experienced sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
   # Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at
   transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to
   70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermitent levophed for
   first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning for
   unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies
   include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS
   physiology or medications.  In addition, volume rescucitation in
   setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs and 3L IVF likely
   has caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and
   pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.  SIRS/sepsis could be
   in the setting of aspiration event during emergent intubation or
   TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved, but need tight bp control given risk
   for AAA rupture.  - Initially aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg /
   hr.  Total LOS neg 5L
   - Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Patient has tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when
   repositioning - will use labetolol or nitro drip for goal MAP 70s
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - will attempt to wean down sedation today; may require nitro drip to
   control BP
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-31**]
   - f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**Last Name (LF) 10314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] culture daily if continues to spike
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will stop
   cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   - Now on labetalol drip, titrate to MAP in 70s.  Will consider using
   nitro drip if needed.
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved with patient on
   Labetalol drip to maintain MAP in 70s.
   - Initially aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Total LOS neg
   5L
   - Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-31**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures cultures -> still pending
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - will attempt to wean down sedation today; may require nitro drip to
   control BP
   - treating empirically for aspiration pna (day [**5-31**] abx today)
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will
   stop cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   - Now on labetalol drip, titrate to MAP in 70s
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE showed EF 35%, infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis
   (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter.
   - Cont Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO
 patient as been in sinus for 24 hours
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   plan for monday
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 113
 122
   - heme/onc consulted, recs appreciated
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.5, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved, pt has primary metabolic alkalosis
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - decrease minute ventilation as able
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   Leukocytosis has resolved, low grade temp cont, will check B/C, urine
   cx today
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and vasopressors. The patient also had elevated cardiac enzymes and ECG changes, indicating possible myocardial infarction (MI). A cardiac catheterization showed triple vessel disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, requiring intermittent use of levophed. The cause is unclear but may be due to unstable AAA, cardiogenic shock, or sepsis/SIRS physiology. The patient has responded to a labetalol drip to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 70s.
- Mixed respiratory failure: The patient initially had hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has improved with aggressive diuresis.
- Coronaries: The patient had significant TnT elevation with myocardial band (MB) of 208, and dynamic changes on the ECG were initially concerning for left main or proximal LAD ischemia. The recent ECG showed persistent STD anterolaterally with a new LAD from leftward axis on initial presentation. A left heart catheterization confirmed triple vessel disease.
- Pump: The patient is concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH admitted to the CCU
   for hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at transfer,
   and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to 70s/50s
   post-emergent intubation, and has required intermitent levophed since
   transfer.  Unclear etiology, although concerning for unstable AAA,
   possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or
   medications.  Bedside echo by cardiology fellow in ED did not show
   decreased LVEF but with moderate to severe MR with unknown baseline,
   which if new could be the etiology to patient's symptoms.  Repeat TTE
   showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved with patient on
   Labetalol drip to maintain MAP in 70s.
   - Initially aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr.  Total LOS neg
   5L
   - Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Maintain MAP>60, CVP>12 (intubated)
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-31**]
   -  f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures cultures -> still pending
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   - attempt to wean levophed -> done
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - will attempt to wean down sedation today; may require nitro drip to
   control BP
   - treating empirically for aspiration pna (day [**5-31**] abx today)
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Cycle cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will
   stop cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   - Now on labetalol drip, titrate to MAP in 70s
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE noted above.
   - aggressive diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath -> increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter.
   - Cont Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO
 patient as been in sinus for 24 hours
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention
   plan for monday
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 113
 122
   - heme/onc consulted, recs appreciated
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.5, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.
   .
   # Acidosis: Patient with mixed non-gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis. Now resolved, pt has primary metabolic alkalosis
   - Trend pH, electrolyes, ABG
   - decrease minute ventilation as able
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although worsening
   leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or ACS.
   Leukocytosis has resolved, low grade temp cont, will check B/C, urine
   cx today
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the CCU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's hypotension has been persistent, with blood pressures in the 80s and 50s. He has required intermittent use of levophed for blood pressure support. The etiology of his hypotension is unclear, but potential causes include cardiogenic shock, distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology, or medications. The patient also has mixed respiratory failure, initially presenting with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. His oxygenation and ventilation have improved with aggressive diuresis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to unstable abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), possible recent dynamic changes. Other potential etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications. Bedside echo did not show decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) but revealed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) with an unknown baseline. Repeat TTE showed worse LVEF on lower dose levophed. The patient is on labetalol drip to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 70s.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix 20 mg/hr, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1 liter.

","The patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also had positive cardiac enzymes (CE), ECG changes, and a catheterization showing 3-vessel disease.

The patient's blood pressure control has been a concern, with hypotension ranging from the 80s to the 50s. This has required intermittent use of levophed for the first several days. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear, but potential causes include cardiogenic shock, distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology, or medications. Volume resuscitation with 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 3 liters of intravenous fluids likely contributed to volume overload, leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.

The patient has been treated for possible aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime, both of which are renally dosed. The patient's fever is still unresolved, and blood cultures have been obtained. The patient's oxygenation and ventilation have improved markedly with aggressive diuresis.

The patient's coronary artery disease is evident with significant TnT elevation and ECG changes, concerning initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath show0ing
   3VD.
   .
   # Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at
   transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to
   70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermitent levophed for
   first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning for
   unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies
   include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS
   physiology or medications.  In addition, volume rescucitation in
   setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs and 3L IVF likely
   has caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and
   pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.  SIRS/sepsis could be
   in the setting of aspiration event during emergent intubation or
   TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved, but need tight bp control given risk
   for AAA rupture.  - Initially aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg /
   hr.  Total LOS neg 5L
   - Goal today (-) one liter, UOP > 50 cc/hr
   - Patient has tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when
   repositioning - will use labetolol or nitro drip for goal MAP 70s
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Recheck ABG with vent changes, currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - will attempt to wean down sedation today; may require nitro drip to
   control BP
   - Treat for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vanco
   and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**5-31**]
   - f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**Last Name (LF) 10314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] culture daily if continues to spike
   - Discussed with blood bank fellow, will fill out transfusion reaction
   form and send pink top -> will repeat type and cross
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the hospital with newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. The patient's current conditions include fever of unknown origin (FUO), acute respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and aortic aneurysm without rupture.

The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, requiring intermittent levophed and tight BP control due to the risk of AAA rupture. He also has mixed respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercarbia, which improved after aggressive diuresis. The patient's oxygenation and ventilation have improved, but he still requires FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5.

There are concerns about the patient's coronary arteries, as he had significant TnT elevation with MB of 208 (CK 1099), and ECG changes showing dynamic changes, concerning initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia. The left heart cath results showed triple vessel disease.

Regarding the AAA, it does not appear to be ruptured, but there is a concern for an impending rupture. The CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no retroperitoneal bleed, or obvious source of blood loss. The patient received two units of blood with appropriate rise and Hct now stable."

 AORTIC ANEURYSM, ABDOMINAL WITHOUT RUPTURE (AAA)
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
   # Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at
   transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to
   70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermitent levophed for
   first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning for
   unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies
   include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS
   physiology or medications.  In addition, volume rescucitation in
   setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs and 3L IVF likely
   has caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and
   pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.  SIRS/sepsis could be
   in the setting of aspiration event during emergent intubation or
   TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved, but need tight bp control given risk
   for AAA rupture.  - Initially aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg /
   hr.  Total LOS neg 5L
   - Goal today <1L UOP 25-50 cc/hr
   - Patient has tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when
   repositioning - will use labetolol or nitro drip for goal MAP 70s
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - will attempt to wean down sedation today; may require nitro drip to
   control BP
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   vanco and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day
   course, today day [**7-1**]
   - Will order mini BAL today
   - f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**Last Name (LF) 10314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] culture daily if continues to spike
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or
   ACS.  Leukocytosis is stable, temp cont, will f/u blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also consider drug rxn given stable WBC
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Will d/c A-line, Central Line today for removal of possible fever
   source
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Will send VZV cx for hand vesicle
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Pt w/ Na of 149 today
   -          likely from overdiuresis
   -          Will order urine lytes to workup etiology
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will stop
   cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   - Now on labetalol drip, titrate to MAP in 70s.  Will consider using
   nitro drip if needed.
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention.
   Previous plan had been for surgery Monday, but now they may defer to
   avoid placing aortic graft when Pt is febrile
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE showed EF 35%, infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis
   (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
   - continue diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter.
   - Cont Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO
 patient as been in sinus for 24 hours
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 138
   - heme/onc consulted, recs appreciated
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.3, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also had elevated cardiac enzymes, ECG changes, and a catheterization showing triple vessel disease (3VD).

The patient's blood pressure control has been challenging, with hypotension in the 70s/50s. He required intermittent levophed for the first several days. The etiology of hypotension is unclear but may be due to unstable AAA, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 3 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF), which likely caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.

The patient is also experiencing mixed respiratory failure, initially presenting as hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. This may be secondary to excessive volume overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), or aspiration event. The patient's oxygenation and ventilation have improved with aggressive diuresis.

The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which could be due to an infectious process, chemical pneumonitis, or acute coronary syndrome (ACS)."

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
   # Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at
   transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to
   70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermitent levophed for
   first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning for
   unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies
   include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS
   physiology or medications.  In addition, volume rescucitation in
   setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs and 3L IVF likely
   has caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and
   pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.  SIRS/sepsis could be
   in the setting of aspiration event during emergent intubation or
   TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved, but need tight bp control given risk
   for AAA rupture.  - Initially aggressive diuresis with lasix 20 mg /
   hr.  Total LOS neg 5L
   - Goal today <1L UOP 25-50 cc/hr
   - Patient has tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when
   repositioning - will use labetolol or nitro drip for goal MAP 70s
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - currently FiO2 40%, PEEP 5
   - will attempt to wean down sedation today; may require nitro drip to
   control BP
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   vanco and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day
   course, today day [**7-1**]
   - Will order mini BAL today
   - f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**Last Name (LF) 10314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] culture daily if continues to spike
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or
   ACS.  Leukocytosis is stable, temp cont, will f/u blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also consider drug rxn given stable WBC
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Will d/c A-line, Central Line today for removal of possible fever
   source
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Will send VZV cx for hand vesicle
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Pt w/ Na of 149 today
   -          likely from overdiuresis
   -          Will order urine lytes to workup etiology
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will stop
   cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   - Now on labetalol drip, titrate to MAP in 70s.  Will consider using
   nitro drip if needed.
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention.
   Previous plan had been for surgery Monday, but now they may defer to
   avoid placing aortic graft when Pt is febrile
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE showed EF 35%, infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis
   (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
   - continue diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter.
   - Cont Telemetry
   - failed DC cardioversion
   - start amio in interim, 150 mg bolus, 1 mg/min for 6 hours, 0.6 mg/min
   for 18 hours -> pt cont in a.flutter/a.fib, in NSR at times
   - will cont amio PO
 patient as been in sinus for 24 hours
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 138
   - heme/onc consulted, recs appreciated
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.3, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also had positive cardiac enzymes, ECG changes, and catheterization showing triple vessel disease.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) - The patient has had a persistent fever throughout the day, despite being on antibiotics. Blood cultures have been taken, and further investigation is needed to determine the source of the infection.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient initially had hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. His oxygenation and ventilation have improved with aggressive diuresis but still requires FiO2 40% and PEEP 5.
3. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - The patient had significant TnT elevation and dynamic ECG changes, indicating possible left main or proximal LAD ischemia. The left heart cath results showed significant stenosis in multiple vessels, but his cardiac biomarkers are now trending down, suggesting improvement.
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) - The patient's AAA does not appear to be ruptured based on the CT abdomen and stable Hct. However, it is concerning for potential rupture, especially with the hypotension"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Critically ill due to aortic abdominal aneurysm, acute on chronic
   systolic and diastolic CHF, blood loss anemia, sepsis.
   Date/time of visit 9/28/9 at 1030.

   on:[**2108-10-22**] 16:50 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also had positive cardiac enzyme (CE) levels, ECG changes, and a cardiac catheterization showing triple vessel disease (3VD).

The patient's blood pressure control has been challenging, with hypotension ranging from the 70s/50s to the 80s. He required intermittent levophed for the first several days. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear but may be related to an unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications. Additionally, volume resuscitation in the setting of suspected ruptured AAA with transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 3 liters of intravenous fluids likely caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.

The patient's respiratory status has stabilized, and he is now ready for extubation today. His mixed respiratory failure initially included hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may have been secondary to excessive volume overload and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR) due to transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or an aspiration event. The patient was difficult to ventilate in the emergency department (ED) and remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and breath stacking when not paralyzed. His oxygenation and ventilation have improved markedly with aggressive diuresis.

The patient is also being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with vancomycin (Vanc). Blood cultures are pending, and tight blood pressure control is necessary due to the risk of AAA rupture. The patient has a tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when repositioned and is currently on labetalol drip with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 70s. He will transition to oral labetalol today.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be concerning for an infectious process, although worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis. The patient has a vesicle on his hand and urticarial rash on his back, which may be a possible drug reaction. Skin scrapings and direct antigen tests for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are pending.

The patient's sodium levels are resolving, likely due to over-diuresis. His coronary artery disease is significant, with TnT elevation to 2.68 and peak CK 2350. The ECG initially showed dynamic changes, but most recent ECGs show largely resolved ST elevation (STE) anterolaterally with new left anterior descending artery (LAD) from leftward axis on initial presentation. Possible revascularization in the future may be considered if the patient improves clinically.

The patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm does not currently appear to be ruptured. The CT abdomen showed no changes in the AAA, no retroperitoneal bleed, or obvious source of blood loss. The patient received 2 units of blood with appropriate rise and Hct now stable. Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding the timing of intervention is recommended. The previous plan had been for surgery on Monday, but it may be deferred to avoid placing an aortic graft when the patient is febrile.

The patient's heart failure is concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension and pulmonary edema with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 2769 even with acute renal failure (ARF). The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, inferoakinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The right heart catheterization showed increased filling"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermitent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved and patient
   hypertensive, in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.
   Patient has tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when
   repositioning
 currently on labetolol drip with goal MAP 70s but ok to
   be slightly lower, ready to transition to PO labetelol.  Initially
   underwent aggressive diuresis initially with lasix 20 mg / hr with
   total LOS neg 5L.  Respiratory status stable, ready for extubation
   today.
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 this morning
   - Goal today even I/O, redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Initiate Labetelol po today at 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Discontinue Labetelol drip 1-2 hours following initiation of po
   Labetelol
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair in setting of
   fevers
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis, ready for extubation
   today.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, BAL showing no growth, all other
   cultures [**Last Name (Titles) 10314**].
   - Extubation today
   - Tight BP control with po Labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc. Likely 7 day course, today day [**7-1**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**Last Name (LF) 10314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] culture daily if continues to spike
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis.
   Leukocytosis is stable, temp cont, will f/u blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also
   consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A line pulled and re-placed,
   central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Vanc trough today for dosing
   - Continue Vanc [**Hospital1 **] as above
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Will send VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx for hand vesicle
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolving, Na 146 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Continue ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Now on Labetelol drip, transition to po Labetalol and d/c drip, goal
   MAP in 70s but ok if slightly below.
   .
 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention.
   Previous plan had been for surgery Monday, but now they may defer to
   avoid placing aortic graft when pt is febrile
   - Trend Hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
  Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.   TTE showed EF 35%,
   infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2).  Right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and
   PCWP 25
   - Continue diuresis as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent emergent intubation and required intermittent use of vasopressor (Levophed) for blood pressure support. The patient also received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 3 liters of intravenous fluid, which likely resulted in volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema due to decompensated heart failure. The patient's respiratory status has improved with aggressive diuresis and is now ready for extubation. The patient is also being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and sepsis/SIRS physiology with vancomycin. There is concern for an infectious process, drug reaction, and possible rupture of the AAA. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and tight blood pressure control is necessary to prevent AAA rupture. The patient's coronary arteries are affected with significant elevation in troponin T, dynamic changes on ECG, and possible revascularization in the future. The patient's renal function is improving, and he is receiving nutrition support. The patient's platelet count is low, and heparin has been held. The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm with 1:1 con"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
   # Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH, at
   transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive to
   70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermitent levophed for
   first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning for
   unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential etiologies
   include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS
   physiology or medications.  In addition, volume rescucitation in
   setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs and 3L IVF likely
   has caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and
   pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.  SIRS/sepsis could be
   in the setting of aspiration event during emergent intubation or
   TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved and patient hypertensive, in need of
   tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.  Patient has tendency to
   become agitated and hypertensive when repositioning
 currently on
   labetolol drip with goal MAP 70s, ready to transition to PO labetelol.
   Initially underwent aggressive diuresis initially with lasix 20 mg / hr
   with total LOS neg 5L.  Respiratory status stable, ready for extubation
   today.
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 this morning
   - Goal today even I/O, redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Initiate Labetelol po today at 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Discontinue Labetelol drip 1-2 hours following initiation of po
   Labetelol
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair in setting of
   fevers
   .
   # Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentaynl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis.
   - Extubation today
   - Tight BP control with po Labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc and cefepime (both renally dosed) and flagyl. Likely 7 day course,
   today day [**7-1**]
   - Will order mini BAL today
   - f/u pending sputum cultures -> commensal organisms only
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**Last Name (LF) 10314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] culture daily if continues to spike
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis or
   ACS.  Leukocytosis is stable, temp cont, will f/u blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also consider drug rxn given stable WBC
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Vanc trough today for dosing
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above.
   - Will d/c A-line, Central Line today for removal of possible fever
   source
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Will send VZV cx for hand vesicle
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Pt w/ Na of 149 today
   -          likely from overdiuresis
   -          Will order urine lytes to workup etiology
   .
   # Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB of
   208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning initially
   for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and V1.  Most
   recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Left heart cath results as above.  Possible
   revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - cardiac biomarkers -> peak CK 2350, now trending down, will stop
   cycle
   - pt becomes hypertensive with agitation, and in setting of known AS,
   LV appears to be able to handle increased wall tension, an encouraging
   sign
   - Now on labetalol drip, titrate to MAP in 70s.  Will consider using
   nitro drip if needed.
   .
   # AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention.
   Previous plan had been for surgery Monday, but now they may defer to
   avoid placing aortic graft when Pt is febrile
   - Trend hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
   # Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.
   - TTE showed EF 35%, infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis
   (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
   - continue diuresis as above
   - Check ScVO2, CVP.
   - right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and PCWP 25
   .
   # Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter, failed DC cardioversion.
   - Cont Telemetry
   - Re-initiate Amiodarone 400mg daily
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam
   -  will monitor, hold heparin for now
   -  plts stable at 138
   - heme/onc consulted, recs appreciated
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Resolving.  Toxicology screen negative.
   - Trend LFTs -> cont to be elevated, stable
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology witih unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes -> creatinine stable 1.4 on admission,
   now 1.3, also encouraging
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Obtain baseline labs from PCP.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermittent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI. Hypotension now resolved and patient hypertensive,
   in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.  Patient has
   tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when repositioning
 was
   on labetolol drip previously, but now on labetalol PO. Goal: SBP<120,
   MAP 70s but ok to be slightly lower. Initially underwent aggressive
   diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr with total LOS neg 5L. Was extubated
   yesterday, respiratory status stable. Yesterday
s goal was even I/O;
   was net approximately 700 negative.
   - Goal today negative 1L , redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Increase labetalol to 200mg po tid
   - Goal SBP <120, even use Nitro PRN if needed to meet this goal
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentanyl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis; extubated successfully
   yesterday.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, BAL showing no growth.
   - Tight BP control with po labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc. Likely 7 day course, today day [**7-31**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> NGTD except for [**10-20**]: coag negative staph
   - will culture daily if continues to spike
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis.
   Leukocytosis is stable/slightly up, afebrile 24 hours now, will f/u
   blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A-line
   pulled and re-placed, central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration
   PNA.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Vanc trough yesterday signified no change to vancomycin dosing;
   continue Vanc [**Hospital1 **] as above (today day [**7-31**])
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Follow-up VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx from hand vesicle
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolving, Na 143 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Decrease atorvastatin to 40 mg (as patient on amiodarone, want to
   decrease risk of rhabdomyolysis)
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Now on po Labetalol; goal MAP in 70s but ok if slightly below; goal
   SBP <120.
   .
 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.  CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP bleed,
   no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with appropriate
   rise and Hct is now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of
   intervention/surgery
   - Trend Hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - Maintain good BP control
   .
  Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.   TTE showed EF 35%,
   infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2).  Right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and
   PCWP 25
   - Continue diuresis as above
   .
  Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter, failed DC cardioversion.
   - Cont. telemetry
   - Amiodarone 400mg daily
   .
  Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam.   Plts 122 on lab draw but 146 on arterial
   line draw.  Will monitor.  Heme/onc consulted. Platelets trending up
   now.
   - Hold heparin for now
   - Monitor platelets daily (151 today)
   .
  Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.  Continues to resolve.
   .
  Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.  Now resolved with Cr
   0.9 today.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   .
   FEN: Thin liquids, soft solids.  Replete lytes prn.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and vasopressors. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), as indicated by the presence of a 3-vessel disease on the cardiac catheterization.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension that has been difficult to control, requiring intermittent use of levophed and labetalol. He is hypertensive now, and tight blood pressure control is necessary to prevent AAA rupture. The patient is also experiencing mixed respiratory failure, initially presenting with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. His oxygenation and ventilation have improved following aggressive diuresis and extubation.

There are concerns regarding fever and leukocytosis, which could be due to an infectious process or chemical pneumonitis. The patient is being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia, and blood cultures have been obtained. He also has hypernatremia, which is resolving, and a history of significant troponin elevation with peak CK 1099, suggesting myocardial ischemia. The ECG showed dynamic changes, initially concerning for left main or proximal LAD ischemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermittent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved and patient
   hypertensive, in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.
   Patient has tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when
   repositioning
 currently on labetolol drip with goal MAP 70s but ok to
   be slightly lower, ready to transition to PO labetelol.  Initially
   underwent aggressive diuresis initially with lasix 20 mg / hr with
   total LOS neg 5L.  Respiratory status stable, was extubated yesterday.
   Yesterday
s goal was even I/O; was net approximately 700 negative.
   - Goal today even I/O, redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Yesterday, initiated Labetelol po 100mg [**Hospital1 **]; discontinued Labetelol
   drip
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair in setting of
   fevers
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentanyl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis, ready for extubation
   yesterday.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, BAL showing no growth, all
   other cultures NGTD. S/p extubation yesterday.
   - Tight BP control with po Labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc. Likely 7 day course, today day [**7-31**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> NGTD except for [**10-20**]: coag negative staph
   - will culture daily if continues to spike
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis.
   Leukocytosis is stable/slightly up, afebrile 24 hours now, will f/u
   blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A line
   pulled and re-placed, central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration
   PNA.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Vanc trough yesterday signified no change to vancomycin dosing;
   continue Vanc [**Hospital1 **] as above
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Follow-up VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx from hand vesicle
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolving, Na 143 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Continue ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Now on po Labetalol; goal MAP in 70s but ok if slightly below.

 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention.
   Previous plan had been for surgery Monday, but now they may defer to
   avoid placing aortic graft when pt is febrile, now afebrile 24 hours

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and vasopressors. The patient also had positive cardiac enzymes, ECG changes, and a catheterization showing triple vessel disease.

The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, and he has required intermittent levophed for the first few days. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear, but it could be due to unstable AAA, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications. The patient has received volume resuscitation with blood products and IV fluids, which may have caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.

The patient's respiratory status has improved after aggressive diuresis and extubation yesterday. He is now on PO labetalol for blood pressure control and will be transitioned off the labetalol drip.

The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which could be due to an infectious process or chemical pneumonitis. Blood cultures have been obtained, and the patient is on vancomycin for possible aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's sodium levels are resolving after aggressive diuresis, and he is being followed up with for hypernatremia.

The patient has significant troponin elevation with peak CK-MB levels and ECG changes, indicating possible ischemia. Left heart cath results showed significant triple vessel disease, and the patient may require revascularization in the future.

The AAA does not appear to be ruptured, and the CT abdomen showed no changes. The patient's Hct is stable, and he is being maintained on good blood pressure control. Vascular surgery recommendations will be followed for the timing of intervention.

The patient's BNP levels indicate decompensated heart failure, and a TTE showed an ejection fraction of 35%, inferoakinesis, and moderate aortic valve stenosis. Right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and PCWP of 25.

The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction but has been intermittently in atrial fibrillation/flutter and failed DC cardioversion. Telemetry will be continued, and amiodarone will be given daily.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to heparin versus consumptive coagulopathy. The platelets are trending up, so heparin will be held, and platelets will be monitored daily.

The patient's transaminitis is resolving and unclear etiology. Acute renal failure is also resolving, and the patient's creatinine is now at 0.9. Trending creatinine, electrolytes, and repeating urine studies will be done"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermittent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI. Hypotension now resolved and patient hypertensive,
   in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.  Patient has
   tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when repositioning
 was
   on labetolol drip previously, but now on labetalol PO. Goal: SBP<120,
   MAP 70s but ok to be slightly lower. Initially underwent aggressive
   diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr with total LOS neg 5L. Was extubated
   yesterday, respiratory status stable. Yesterday
s goal was even I/O;
   was net approximately 700 negative.
   - Goal today negative 1L , redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Increase labetalol to 200mg po tid
   - Goal SBP <120, even use Nitro PRN if needed to meet this goal
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentanyl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis; extubated successfully
   yesterday.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, BAL showing no growth.
   - Tight BP control with po labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc. Likely 7 day course, today day [**7-31**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> NGTD except for [**10-20**]: coag negative staph
   - will culture daily if continues to spike
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis.
   Leukocytosis is stable/slightly up, afebrile 24 hours now, will f/u
   blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A-line
   pulled and re-placed, central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration
   PNA.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Vanc trough yesterday signified no change to vancomycin dosing;
   continue Vanc [**Hospital1 **] as above (today day [**7-31**])
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Follow-up VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx from hand vesicle
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolving, Na 143 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Decrease atorvastatin to 40 mg (as patient on amiodarone, want to
   decrease risk of rhabdomyolysis)
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Now on po Labetalol; goal MAP in 70s but ok if slightly below; goal
   SBP <120.
   .
 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.  CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP bleed,
   no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with appropriate
   rise and Hct is now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of
   intervention/surgery
   - Trend Hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - Maintain good BP control
   .
  Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.   TTE showed EF 35%,
   infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2).  Right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and
   PCWP 25
   - Continue diuresis as above
   .
  Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter, failed DC cardioversion.
   - Cont. telemetry
   - Amiodarone 400mg daily
   .
  Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam.   Plts 122 on lab draw but 146 on arterial
   line draw.  Will monitor.  Heme/onc consulted. Platelets trending up
   now.
   - Hold heparin for now
   - Monitor platelets daily (151 today)
   .
  Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.  Continues to resolve.
   .
  Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.  Now resolved with Cr
   0.9 today.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   .
   FEN: Thin liquids, soft solids.  Replete lytes prn.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU with newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and vasopressors. The patient also has evidence of acute kidney injury, coronary artery disease, and thrombocytopenia. He is currently being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis. The patient's blood pressure control remains a concern, and there is a need for tight blood pressure control to prevent AAA rupture. The patient's respiratory status has improved since extubation yesterday.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and tight blood pressure control is necessary to prevent AAA rupture.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has improved since extubation.
3. Infection: The patient has signs of fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infectious process, such as aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has significant TnT elevation with peak CK 2350, and his ECG shows dynamic changes. Revascularization may be necessary in the future.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has resolved acute renal failure, but close monitoring of renal function is needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermittent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI.  Hypotension now resolved and patient
   hypertensive, in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.
   Patient has tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when
   repositioning
 currently on labetolol drip with goal MAP 70s but ok to
   be slightly lower, ready to transition to PO labetelol.  Initially
   underwent aggressive diuresis initially with lasix 20 mg / hr with
   total LOS neg 5L.  Respiratory status stable, was extubated yesterday.
   - Goal today even I/O, redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Yesterday, initiated Labetelol po 100mg [**Hospital1 **]; discontinued Labetelol
   drip 1-2 hours following initiation of po Labetelol
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair in setting of
   fevers
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentanyl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis, ready for extubation
   yesterday.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, BAL showing no growth, all
   other cultures [**Last Name (Titles) 10314**]. S/p extubation yesterday.
   - Tight BP control with po Labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc. Likely 7 day course, today day [**7-31**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**Last Name (LF) 10314**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] culture daily if continues to spike
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis.
   Leukocytosis is stable, temp cont, will f/u blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also
   consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A line pulled and re-placed,
   central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Vanc trough today for dosing
   - Continue Vanc [**Hospital1 **] as above
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Will send VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx for hand vesicle
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolving, Na 143 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Continue ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Now on Labetelol drip, transition to po Labetalol and d/c drip, goal
   MAP in 70s but ok if slightly below.
   .
 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.   CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP
   bleed, no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with
   appropriate rise and Hct now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of intervention.
   Previous plan had been for surgery Monday, but now they may defer to
   avoid placing aortic graft when pt is febrile
   - Trend Hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - maintain good BP control
   .
  Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.   TTE showed EF 35%,
   infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2).  Right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and
   PCWP 25
   - Continue diuresis as above
   .
  Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter, failed DC cardioversion.
   - Cont Telemetry
   - Re-initiate Amiodarone 400mg daily
   .
  Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam.   Plts 122 on lab draw but 146 on arterial
   line draw.  Will monitor.  Heme/onc consulted.
   -  Hold heparin for now
   - Monitor platelets daily
   .
  Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.  Resolving.
   .
  Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.  Now resolved with Cr
   1.1 today.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   - Repeat UA, urine electrolytes, and urine eos, and repeat urine
   culture
   - Completing NAC and NaHCO3 for CIN prophylaxis.

   tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when repositioning
 was
   on labetolol drip previously, but now on labetalol PO. Goal: SBP<120,
   MAP 70s but ok to be slightly lower. Initially underwent aggressive
   diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr with total LOS neg 5L. Was extubated
   yesterday, respiratory status stable. Yesterday
s goal was -1L I/O; was
   net 1L negative.
   - Goal today negative 0.5-1L , redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Decrease labetalol to 200 [**Hospital1 7**] given hypotensive episode yesterday.
   - Goal SBP <120, even use Nitro PRN if needed to meet this goal
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair

   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible CABG in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Decrease Aspirin to 81 qday
   - Continue Atorvastatin 40 mg (as patient on amiodarone, want to
   decrease risk of rhabdomyolysis)
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Labetalol 200mg [**Hospital1 **] as above; goal MAP in 70s but ok if slightly
   below; goal SBP <120.
   .
 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.  CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP bleed,
   no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with appropriate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. The patient also had a positive cardiac enzyme (CE) level, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and cardiac catheterization showing triple vessel disease (3VD). 

The patient's initial presentation included hypotension in the 80s, and he required intermittent levophed for several days. His blood pressure control has been challenging, with episodes of hypotension and hypertension. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 3 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF), which likely resulted in volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly with aggressive diuresis and extubation. He is currently on labetalol for blood pressure control and Vancomycin for suspected aspiration pneumonia and bacteremia. 

The patient's leukocytosis has improved, and he is now afebrile. His sodium levels have resolved, and his renal function has improved. However, the patient still requires close monitoring due to concerns about his AAA, potential coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermittent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI. Hypotension now resolved and patient hypertensive,
   in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.  Patient has
   tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when repositioning
 was
   on labetolol drip previously, but now on labetalol PO. Goal: SBP<120,
   MAP 70s but ok to be slightly lower. Initially underwent aggressive
   diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr with total LOS neg 5L. Was extubated
   yesterday, respiratory status stable. Yesterday
s goal was even I/O;
   was net approximately 700 negative.
   - Goal today negative 1L-1.5 , redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - decrease labetalol to 200 [**Hospital1 7**] given hypotensive episode yesterday.
   - Goal SBP <120, even use Nitro PRN if needed to meet this goal
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentanyl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis; extubated successfully
   yesterday.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, BAL showing no growth.
   - Tight BP control with po labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc. Likely 7 day course, today day [**7-31**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> NGTD except for [**10-20**]: coag negative staph
   - will culture daily until negative, at that point will start 14 day
   course
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process leukocytosis
   improved, afebrile 48 hours now, will f/u blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also
   consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A-line pulled and re-placed,
   central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, bacteremia,
   therefore pt will require 14 day course from first negative cx. Pt also
   w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for possible
   drug rxn.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Vanc trough yesterday not drawn at appropriate time; continue Vanc
   [**Hospital1 **] as above (today day 7), re-check vanc trough today
   - Follow-up VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx from hand vesicle, culture pending, DFA
   slides misplaced
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolving, Na 143 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible CABG in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Decrease Aspirin to 81 qday
   - Decrease atorvastatin to 40 mg (as patient on amiodarone, want to
   decrease risk of rhabdomyolysis)
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Now on po Labetalol; goal MAP in 70s but ok if slightly below; goal
   SBP <120.
   .
 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.  CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP bleed,
   no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with appropriate
   rise and Hct is now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of
   intervention/surgery
   - Trend Hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - Maintain good BP control
   .
  Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.   TTE showed EF 35%,
   infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2).  Right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and
   PCWP 25
   - Continue diuresis as above
   .
  Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter, failed DC cardioversion, NSR this
   AM.
   - Cont. telemetry
   - Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**], will plan on decreasing to once daily
   .
  Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam.   Plts 122 on lab draw but 146 on arterial
   line draw.  Will monitor.  Heme/onc consulted. Platelets trending up
   now.
   - Hold heparin for now
   - Monitor platelets daily (151 today)
   .
  Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.  Continues to resolve.
   .
  Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.  Now resolved with Cr
   0.9 today.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   .
   FEN: Thin liquids, soft solids.  Replete lytes prn.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermittent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI. Hypotension now resolved and patient hypertensive,
   in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.  Patient has
   tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when repositioning
 was
   on labetolol drip previously, but now on labetalol PO. Goal: SBP<120,
   MAP 70s but ok to be slightly lower. Initially underwent aggressive
   diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr with total LOS neg 5L. Was extubated
   yesterday, respiratory status stable. Yesterday
s goal was even I/O;
   was net approximately 700 negative.
   - Goal today negative 1L , redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Increase labetalol to 200mg po tid
   - Goal SBP <120, even use Nitro PRN if needed to meet this goal
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentanyl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis; extubated successfully
   yesterday.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, BAL showing no growth.
   - Tight BP control with po labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc. Likely 7 day course, today day [**7-31**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> NGTD except for [**10-20**]: coag negative staph
   - will culture daily if continues to spike
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process, although
   worsening leukocytosis could also be caused by chemical pneumonitis.
   Leukocytosis is stable/slightly up, afebrile 24 hours now, will f/u
   blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A-line
   pulled and re-placed, central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration
   PNA.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Vanc trough yesterday signified no change to vancomycin dosing;
   continue Vanc [**Hospital1 **] as above (today day [**7-31**])
   - Pt also w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for
   possible drug rxn.
   - Follow-up VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx from hand vesicle
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolving, Na 143 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible revascularization in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Decrease atorvastatin to 40 mg (as patient on amiodarone, want to
   decrease risk of rhabdomyolysis)
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Now on po Labetalol; goal MAP in 70s but ok if slightly below; goal
   SBP <120.
   .
 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.  CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP bleed,
   no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with appropriate
   rise and Hct is now stable.
   - Follow-up with vascular surgery regarding timing of
   intervention/surgery
   - Trend Hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - Maintain good BP control
   .
  Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.   TTE showed EF 35%,
   infero akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2).  Right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and
   PCWP 25
   - Continue diuresis as above
   .
  Rhythmn: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter, failed DC cardioversion.
   - Cont. telemetry
   - Amiodarone 400mg daily
   .
  Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam.   Plts 122 on lab draw but 146 on arterial
   line draw.  Will monitor.  Heme/onc consulted. Platelets trending up
   now.
   - Hold heparin for now
   - Monitor platelets daily (151 today)
   .
  Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.  Continues to resolve.
   .
  Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.  Now resolved with Cr
   0.9 today.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes
   .
   FEN: Thin liquids, soft solids.  Replete lytes prn.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, respiratory failure, and positive cardiac enzymes. The patient required intubation and pressors. He has a history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypotension that is currently controlled with labetalol.
- Respiratory failure, now resolved after aggressive diuresis and extubation.
- Fever and leukocytosis, possibly due to an infectious process or chemical pneumonitis.
- Hypernatremia, likely due to over-diuresis.
- Coronary artery disease with significant TnT elevation and dynamic changes on ECG, indicating possible left main or proximal LAD ischemia.
- AAA, currently stable without signs of rupture.
- Pump dysfunction with decompensated heart failure, moderate aortic valve stenosis, and increased filling pressures.
- Rhythm disturbances, currently in sinus rhythm but with intermittent A fib/A flutter.
- Thrombocytopenia, possibly due to consumptive coagulopathy or heparin therapy.
- Transaminitis, unclear etiology.
- Acute renal failure, now resolved.
- Impaired physical mobility.
- Fever, of unknown origin.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred to the hospital with newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and vasopressors. The patient also had chest pain, ECG changes, and cardiac catheterization showing triple vessel disease.

The patient was hypotensive upon admission and required intermittent levophed for the first few days. There was concern for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes, and potential etiologies including cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications. The patient received volume resuscitation, which likely caused volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.

The patient underwent aggressive diuresis with lasix and was successfully extubated yesterday. The goal is to maintain tight blood pressure control with a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) <120 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 70s. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and he is now on labetalol orally.

There were concerns about infectious processes, including possible aspiration pneumonia, bacteremia, and fever/leukocytosis. The patient received vancomycin for suspected aspiration pneumonia and bacteremia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermittent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI. Hypotension now resolved and patient hypertensive,
   in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.  Patient has
   tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when repositioning
 was
   on labetolol drip previously, but now on labetalol PO. Goal: SBP<120,
   MAP 70s but ok to be slightly lower. Initially underwent aggressive
   diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr with total LOS neg 5L. Was extubated
   yesterday, respiratory status stable. Yesterday
s goal was -1L I/O; was
   net 1L negative.
   - Goal today negative 0.5-1L , redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Decrease labetalol to 200 [**Hospital1 7**] given hypotensive episode yesterday.
   - Goal SBP <120, even use Nitro PRN if needed to meet this goal
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentanyl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis; extubated successfully
   [**10-22**].  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA and bacteremia, BAL showing no
   growth but positive cultures 9/26 and [**10-21**].
   - Tight BP control with po labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc 14 day course given bacteremia, today day [**9-7**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**10-20**] and [**10-21**]: coag negative staph
   - Will culture daily until negative, on a 14 day course for Staph
   bacteremia
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process leukocytosis
   improved, afebrile 48 hours now, will f/u blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also
   consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A-line pulled and re-placed,
   central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, bacteremia,
   therefore pt will require 14 day course from first negative cx. Pt also
   w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for possible
   drug rxn.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Culture daily until negative as above
   - Vanc trough yesterday not drawn at appropriate time; continue Vanc
   [**Hospital1 **] as above (today day 7), re-check vanc trough today
   - Follow-up VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx from hand vesicle, culture pending, DFA
   slides misplaced
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolved, Na 143 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an outside hospital to our facility with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. He also has coronary artery disease (CAD) with positive cardiac enzymes and changes on catheterization showing triple vessel disease (3VD). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive at times, which could be due to cardiogenic shock, distributive shock from sepsis/SIRS physiology, or volume overload leading to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
2. Mixed Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly secondary to excessive volume overload and worsened mitral regurgitation. Aggressive diuresis has improved oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Infection/Sepsis: The patient has been treated for possible aspiration pneumonia, bacteremia, and chemical pneumonitis with a 14-day course of vancomycin. Blood cultures have shown no growth but positive cultures for coag-negative staphylococci. There is a concern for a possible drug reaction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch, 84.4 kg male who was admitted to the ICU for aortic aneurysm, acute coronary syndrome, respiratory failure, impaired physical mobility, delirium, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, and septic shock. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on multiple medications including Haldol, labetalol, amiodarone, heparin, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 110/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of hallucinations. Physical examination reveals a harsh systolic ejection murmur and minimal crackles at the bases. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient has been on a 14-day course of vancomycin with daily blood cultures until negative to determine the end date for vancomycin. The patient is NPO at midnight for an elective vascular procedure tomorrow. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 340 mL. The patient's care includes prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and sepsis. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which can be a life-threatening condition if not properly managed. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is essential.
2. Impaired physical mobility: The patient's impaired physical mobility can lead to complications such as muscle weakness, pressure ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis. Regular repositioning and physical therapy may be necessary.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium should be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications like falls, self-removal of restraints, and worsening confusion.
4. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's fever needs to be investigated to determine the underlying cause. It could indicate an infection or another medical condition.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessment and repositioning are necessary.
6. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock requires close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, and organ function. Prompt treatment of any infection is crucial.
7. Aortic aneurysm: The patient's aortic aneurysm carries the risk of rupture if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring and consideration of surgical intervention may be required.
8. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient's acute coronary syndrome needs to be managed appropriately with medications and possibly invasive procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery.
9. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: The patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm carries the risk of rupture. Regular monitoring and consideration of surgical repair may be necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HTN
   and hyperlipidemia transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] from an OSH with newly
   diagnosed infrarenal AAA, hypotension and respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and pressors.  Also had +CE, ECG changes and cath showing
   3VD.
   .
  Blood pressure control: Patient was hypotensive to SBP 80s at OSH,
   at transfer, and in the [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  He became increasingly hypotensive
   to 70s/50s post-emergent intubation, and required intermittent levophed
   for first several days at [**Hospital1 19**].  Unclear etiology, although concerning
   for unstable AAA, possible recent dynamic changes.  Potential
   etiologies include cardiogenic shock or distributive shock from
   sepsis/SIRS physiology or medications.  In addition, volume
   rescucitation in setting of suspected ruptured AAA with 5 units PRBCs
   and 3L IVF likely has caused volume overload leading to decreased
   cardiac output and pulmonary edema from decompensated heart failure.
   SIRS/sepsis could be in the setting of aspiration event during emergent
   intubation or TRALI. Hypotension now resolved and patient hypertensive,
   in need of tight BP control given risk for AAA rupture.  Patient has
   tendency to become agitated and hypertensive when repositioning
 was
   on labetolol drip previously, but now on labetalol PO. Goal: SBP<120,
   MAP 70s but ok to be slightly lower. Initially underwent aggressive
   diuresis with lasix 20 mg / hr with total LOS neg 5L. Was extubated
   yesterday, respiratory status stable. Yesterday
s goal was -1L I/O; was
   net 1L negative.
   - Goal today negative 0.5-1L , redose Lasix this evening as needed
   - Decrease labetalol to 200 [**Hospital1 7**] given hypotensive episode yesterday.
   - Goal SBP <120, even use Nitro PRN if needed to meet this goal
   - f/u Vascular surgery recs re: CABG and AAA repair
   .
  Mixed respiratory failure: Patient initially had possible hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hypoxia may have been secondary to
   excessive volume overload in setting of volume rescuscitation and
   worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 509**] from transfusion (i.e. TRALI) or aspiration event.
   Patient was difficult to ventilate in ED requiring vecuronium, and
   remained difficult to ventilate with significant auto-PEEP and
   breathstacking when not paralyzed.  Hypercarbia likely caused by
   fentanyl for back pain, although unclear if patient has history of
   obstructive lung disease.  Pt oxygenation and ventilation has improved
   markedly in setting of aggressive diuresis; extubated successfully
   [**10-22**].  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA and bacteremia, BAL showing no
   growth but positive cultures 9/26 and [**10-21**].
   - Tight BP control with po labetelol as above
   - Treating for aspiration pneumonia versus chemical pneumonitis with
   Vanc 14 day course given bacteremia, today day [**9-7**]
   - f/u blood cultures -> [**10-20**] and [**10-21**]: coag negative staph
   - Will culture daily until negative, on a 14 day course for Staph
   bacteremia
   .
  Fever/Leukocytosis: Concerning for infectious process leukocytosis
   improved, afebrile 48 hours now, will f/u blood, urine cx. [**Month (only) 51**] also
   consider drug rxn given stable WBC.  A-line pulled and re-placed,
   central line removed.  On Vanc for ?aspiration PNA, bacteremia,
   therefore pt will require 14 day course from first negative cx. Pt also
   w/ vesicle on hand, urticarial rash on back, concerning for possible
   drug rxn.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC
   - Culture daily until negative as above
   - Vanc trough yesterday not drawn at appropriate time; continue Vanc
   [**Hospital1 **] as above (today day 7), re-check vanc trough today
   - Follow-up VZV, HSV [**1-27**] cx from hand vesicle, culture pending, DFA
   slides misplaced
   .
  Hypernatremia:  Resolved, Na 143 today, likely [**2-27**] over-diuresis.
   .
  Coronaries: Patient with significant TnT elevation to 2.68 with MB
   of 208 (CK 1099). ECG demonstrating dynamic changes, concerning
   initially for left main or proximal LAD ischemia given STE in aVR and
   V1.  Most recent ECG with largely resolved STE, but with persistent STD
   anterolaterally with new LAD from leftward axis on intial
   presentation.  Peak CK 2350.  Left heart cath results as above.
   Possible CABG in future if patient improves clinically.
   - Decrease Aspirin to 81 qday
   - Continue Atorvastatin 40 mg (as patient on amiodarone, want to
   decrease risk of rhabdomyolysis)
   - Hold on plavix, heparin gtt, ACE-I, given hypotension and concern for
   ruptured AAA.
   - Labetalol 200mg [**Hospital1 **] as above; goal MAP in 70s but ok if slightly
   below; goal SBP <120.
   .
 AAA: Currently does not appear to be ruptured.  Concern on [**10-18**] with
   9 point drop in Hct.  CT abdomen showed no changes in AAA, no RP bleed,
   no obvious source of blood loss.  Given 2 units blood with appropriate
   rise and Hct is now stable.
   - EVR today, per vascular surgery
   - Trend Hct, maintain active T+S, crossmatch
   - Maintain good BP control
   .
  Pump: Concerning for decompensated heart failure given hypotension
   and pulmonary edema with BNP 2769 even with ARF.   TTE showed EF 35%,
   inferior akinesis, moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2).  Right heart cath showed increased filling pressures and
   PCWP 25
   - Continue diuresis as above
   .
  Rhythm: Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Has been
   intermittently in A fib/A flutter, failed DC cardioversion, NSR this
   AM.
   - Cont. telemetry
   - Decrease Amiodarone 400mg to once daily (based on day of initiation
   of Amio loading)
   .
  Thrombocytopenia- etiology includes heparin vs. consumptive, no
   evidence of DIC on exam.   Plts 122 on lab draw but 146 on arterial
   line draw.  Will monitor.  Heme/onc consulted, do not believe HIT.
   Platelets trending up now.
   - Restart Heparin SC as low suspicion for HIT
   - Monitor platelets daily
   .
  Transaminitis: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline, although this
   may be secondary to hypotension, acute renal failure, or
   rhabdomyolysis. Toxicology screen negative.  Continues to resolve on
   last check, recheck tomorrow.
   - Recheck LFTs tomorrow to trend resolution of transaminitis
   .
  Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology with unknown baseline. Could
   be end organ damage in setting of shock or contrast induced
   nephropathy, although less likely given timing.  Now resolved with Cr
   1.1 today.
   - Trend creatinine, electrolytes

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10173**] is a 69-year-old gentleman with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He was transferred from an outside hospital with a newly diagnosed infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypotension, and respiratory failure requiring intubation and pressors. He also has coronary artery disease (CAD) with positive cardiac enzyme (CE) elevation, ECG changes, and a cardiac catheterization showing triple vessel disease (3VD).

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Blood pressure control: Stable overnight but still low. Not currently requiring pressors. Tight BP control is needed due to AAA. Continue labetalol at 200 [**Hospital1 7**] with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 120. Use Nitro PRN if needed to meet this goal.
2. Mixed respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation and ventilation have improved significantly with aggressive diuresis, and he was successfully extubated on [**10-22**]. He is being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia and bacteremia with a 14-day course of vancomycin (Vanc). Daily blood cultures will be taken until negative.
3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis have resolved. He will continue on Vanc for aspiration PNA and bacteremia until his blood cultures are negative for at least 14"
