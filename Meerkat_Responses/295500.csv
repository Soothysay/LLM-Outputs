   Disposition:ICU until extubated
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). She was admitted to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypertension, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

- Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The absence of fever, sputum production, or cough suggests that pneumonia is unlikely. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, but a computed tomography angiography (CTA) did not show any PE. The most likely diagnosis is flash pulmonary edema secondary to known diastolic dysfunction. The plan is to reduce afterload with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and titrate up captopril as tolerated. Nitroglycerin infusion will be continued while attempting extubation, and then a trial switch to long-acting nitrates will be made.

- Hypertension: The goal is to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 140. Nitroglycerin infusion will be weaned off, and the patient will be started on ACEIs, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and hydralazine as needed for"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She presented with acute shortness of breath, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypertension, and a UTI. The patient was intubated due to flash pulmonary edema and required invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and intubated.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of low urine output overnight, persistent requirement for nitroglycerin, and increased oral antihypertensives.

The patient has allergies to morphine and Haldol (Haloperidol Lactate). The patient's medications include propofol, nitroglycerin, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 539 mL and total output of 950 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 411 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), lung disease, and hypertension. She was admitted with malignant hypertension, flash pulmonary edema, and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been receiving various treatments including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and antibiotics. She also has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, schizoaffective disorder, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation. There is a potential for continued respiratory failure if weaning trials are unsuccessful.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with multiple antihypertensive medications. It is important to maintain blood pressure control to prevent further complications.
3. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which needs to be properly treated considering her history of antibiotic resistance.
4. CHF: The patient's underlying congestive heart failure may worsen due to the current stress on the heart and inadequate cardiac function.
5. Pulmonary Artery Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary artery hypertension,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), lung disease, and malignant hypertension.
- She was admitted with flash pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation.
- Over the past 24 hours, the patient's intake/output (I/O) has been even, and she received one dose of lasix.
- She failed a weaning trial yesterday due to falling oxygen saturation levels during the trial.
- Antibiotic coverage for a urinary tract infection (UTI) was changed from ciprofloxacin to ceftriaxone.
- The patient's allergies include morphine, Haldol (oral), and Parkinsonian symptoms.
- She received propofol infusion, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (lasix), and lorazepam (Ativan).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/59 to 165/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has received a total of 2,869 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 2,243 mL.
- She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.53, PaCO2 of 31, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 128, and ventilation rate of 7.1 L/min.
- The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.01 ng/mL, and glucose of 112 mg/dL.
- The patient's medical and family history is unchanged from admission, except for the noted review of systems.
- The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments.
- The patient's disposition is currently unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be continued.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers due to the body's stress response. Prophylactic medications like proton pump inhibitors should be considered.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations indicate episodes of hypotension. Monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure are essential.
5. Arrhythm"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), lung disease, and hypertension. She was admitted with malignant hypertension, flash pulmonary edema, and hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. 

Over the past day, the patient's input/output has been even, and she was given one dose of lasix. She failed a weaning trial yesterday due to falling oxygen saturation levels during the trial. The antibiotic coverage for her urinary tract infection (UTI) was changed from ciprofloxacin to ceftriaxone. Isordil was increased, and nitroglycerin was weaned off.

The patient has allergies to morphine and Haldol (Haloperidol Lactate). Her last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 09/27/2119 at 08:00 PM and ceftriaxone on 09/27/2119 at 10:00 PM. She is currently receiving propofol infusion and other ICU medications such as heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and lorazepam (Ativan).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: she has a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 68 beats per minute (bpm), a blood pressure of 133/59 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,869 mL and output of 2,243 mL since 12:00 AM. Her respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her blood gases show a pH of 7.53, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 128 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 64 mEq/L.

On physical examination, the patient is intubated and sedated. Her neck is supple, without significant jugular venous distention (JVD) or carotid bruits. Her pulmonary examination reveals coarse mechanical breath sounds anteriorly and laterally, without crackles or wheezes. Her cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Her abdomen is soft and moderately distended, with hypoactive bowel sounds. Her extremities show no edema,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), restrictive lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The patient presented with acute shortness of breath, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypertension, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The cause of this condition is suspected to be flash pulmonary edema in the setting of known diastolic dysfunction. The plan includes afterload reduction with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and diuresis as tolerated.

2. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 140 mmHg. The treatment plan includes ACEI, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), nitrate, and continuing home beta-blockers (BBs). Florinef is held due to unclear indication for adrenal insufficiency, and further investigation is needed.

3. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection indicated by a positive urine analysis (UA). Antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending. The plan is to continue the current antibiotic therapy for a 7-day course.

4. COPD: There is no evidence of COP"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has been agitated and hypertensive prior to weaning, leading to the decision to hold off extubation. The patient received an additional dose of lasix, resulting in a drop in blood pressure to the 80s. A 500cc bolus was given, but overall, the day was negative. Zyprexa was administered early in the morning today, and the patient is now on hydral and nitro gtt for blood pressure control during extubation to prevent recurrent flash pulmonary edema. A head CT was performed due to AMS and positive Babinski sign bilaterally, but preliminary read was negative.

Allergies include morphine, unknown to Haldol (Oral), and Parkinsonian [**Last Name**]. The last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 09/27/2119 at 08:00 PM and ceftriaxone on 09/28/2119 at 08:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving propofol at 50 mcg/Kg/min, nitroglycerin at 0.7 mcg/Kg/min, and furosemide (Lasix) at 09:00 PM on 09/28/2119. Heparin sodium is being given as prophylaxis starting at 01:00 AM on 09/29/2119. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and more. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. ABG results show pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and HCO3- of 76 mEq/L. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments, which were not assessed. Lab results include elevated leukocyte count (WBC) of 9.3, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 32.2, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 342, increased creatinine (Cr) of 1.3, and other values within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient experienced recurrent flash pulmonary edema, which required intervention with hydralazine and nitroglycerin to control blood pressure during extubation.
2. Agitation and hypertension: The patient exhibited agitation and hypertension prior to weaning, indicating potential complications during the extubation process.
3. Unknown allergies: The patient has unknown allergies to morphine and Haldol (Oral), which may pose challenges in managing pain and sedation.
4. Neurological issues: The patient showed signs of altered mental status (AMS) and bilateral positive Babinski signs, suggesting possible neurological complications.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant negative balance, indicating potential dehydration or ongoing fluid losses.
6. Respiratory distress: The patient requires respiratory support with CMV mode, indicating respiratory distress and the need for continued mechanical ventilation.
7. Potential infection: Elevated leukocyte count (WBC) could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory response.
8. Renal impairment: Decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and increased creatinine"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which may be due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of known diastolic dysfunction. This is already being treated with afterload reduction and diuretics.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it needs to be controlled to maintain a goal systolic blood pressure below 140. The treatment plan includes ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and continuing home blood pressure management.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine analysis and has been treated with antibiotics. There is growth of E. coli, and sensitivities are pending. The plan is to continue the current antibiotic therapy and treat for a 7-day course for complicated UTI.

4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD, but there is no evidence of exacerbation at this time. Treatment includes home albuterol as needed and Advair once extubated.

5. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of diastolic CHF and presents with acute shortness of breath and hypoxic respiratory failure. Treatment includes diuretics, afterload reduction, and blood pressure control.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute onset hypoxic respiratory failure. Given her history of diastolic dysfunction, it is possible that she may experience recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment. It is important to continue afterload reduction with ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and nitrates to maintain blood pressure below 140 mmHg.

3. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli. Sensitivities are pending, and she will be treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics.

4. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, but there is no evidence of exacerbation on examination. She may require home albuterol and inhaled corticosteroids such as fluticasone and vilanterol (Advair) once extubated.

5. CHF: The patient's symptoms are consistent with flash pulmonary edema"

   Given absence of fevers, sputum production or h/o cough, PNA unlikely,
   CXR does not show convincing infiltrate. Pt does have h/o PE, pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension from [**6-22**] ECHO however CTA from same time
   negative for PE, currently pt not hypotensive, not tachycardic. Story
   most consistent with flash pulmonary edema in setting of known
   diastolic dysfunction.
   -afterload reduction with ACEI, titrating up captopril as tolerated,
   now at 37.5 TID, transition to long acting when stable on oral BP
   regimen
   -Off nitro gtt, when BP stable on PO regimen, transition isordil to
   longer acting home nitrate.
   -continue home CCB, amlodipine
   -d/c hydral
   -ABG still with hypoxia, though improved since pt diuresed >1L
   overnight.  Repeat CXR today, continue to diurese as tolerated.
   Re-attempt vent wean today, have decreased Fi02, will try pressure

   cortisol level >50 from [**2115**] will research OMR.
   <I>## UTI:</I>UA +, received levaquin and CTX in ed
   -sent u/a for culture, growing GNRs, not speciated yet.
   -cipro switched to CTX as pt has h/o e. coli resistant to cipro,
   however repeat urine cx showed clearance of bacteria on cipro.  Will
   f/u sensis and plan to treat for 7 day course for complicated UTI,
   currently day [**4-21**]
   <I>## COPD:</I>No evidence one exam for COPD exacerbation. Per [**Name (NI) 4232**] pt
   has primarily restrictive defect and DLCO out of proportion to degree
   of COPD.  ? restrictive lung disease due to RA?  Severe CHF?
   -home albuterol PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), restrictive lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). She was admitted to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath, hypoxic respiratory failure, hypertension, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is currently on propofol sedation and has been given additional doses of lasix for diuresis and hydralazine for blood pressure control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 185/66 mmHg to 80s, respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 32.2, platelet count (Plt) of 342,000/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.3, troponin-T level of 0.01, and glucose level of 112 mg/dL. The urine culture revealed an infection with Escherichia coli, which was presumptively identified.

Radiology findings include an improved chest X-ray (CXR) showing interval improvement in"
