   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT: 60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA who
   presents with dyspnea x3 days, AFib, and new dilated CM with EF
   15-20%.
   PLAN:
   .
   CHF, systolic, new diagnosis:  Stable.  Patient's BPs when she reached
   the CCU was 60-80s systolic.  On exam, patient's lungs are CTAB, 12 cm
   JVD, cool extremities, c/w cardiogenic shock.  Patient's BPs have been
   low, likely compounded with AFib with RVR.
   - Will start Dobutamine gtt with goal SBP > 100
   - Will diurese patient once SBPs are consistently above 90.
   AFib with RVR, new diagnosis:  Patient's rates have been poorly
   controlled, likely exacerbating CHF.  Pt given several doses of dilt
   and metoprolol for control, BP has dropped.  For now, will continue
   with positive inotropic [**Doctor Last Name **].  Demand likely etiology of elevation
   (mild) in trops.
   - Defer rate control, start amio gtt if needed.
   - Start heparin IV gtt
   - Continue ASA 325mg
   .
   Dilated Cardiomyopathy, new diagnosis:  Unclear etiology.  Given that
   patient has clear lungs, but is in heart failure, likely that this is a
   chronic process.  Pt had cath in [**5-14**] that was normal, performed
   because patient had CP during exercise MIBI (normal) and hypotension.
   EF at that time was > 55%.  Differential includes viral, metabolic,
   hemachromatosis, idiopathic.  Echo did not show evidence of amyloid.
   Patient's Fe studies are normal except for elevated ferritin, and TSH
   is WNL.
   - Pending Hepatitis, CMV, EBV serologies; urine/serum tox
   .
   ARF: Cr of 1.4 compared to b/l of 0.8. Likely prerenal.
   - Once SBP < 90, will start lasix gtt and monitor UOP

   .
   UTI: Positive UA.  Started on cipro in ED for ?UTI, asymptomatic.  Urne
   sample contaminated with epithelial cells.
   - recheck UA, Ucx

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient presents with dyspnea for three days, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 106 bpm with a range of 92-115 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 70/43 mmHg to 133/79 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute with a range of 18-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97%.

The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF), systolic, new diagnosis. The patient's lungs are clear to bilaterally augmented breath sounds, and there is jugular venous distention (JVD) of 12 cm. The patient also has cool extremities, indicating possible cardiogenic shock. The patient's blood pressures have been low, likely compounded with AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The plan for the patient includes starting dobutamine to increase systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 100 mmHg, and diuresing the patient once SBPs are consistently above 90 mmHg. The patient has been given several doses of diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control, but the BP has dropped. For now, the patient will continue with positive inotropic support. The demand likely etiology of elevation (mild) in troponin-tropT levels is noted.

The patient has also been diagnosed with AFib with RVR, dilated cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), urinary tract infection (UTI), transaminitis, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including dobutamine, diuretics, heparin, aspirin, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening cardiogenic shock, further deterioration of renal function, development of sepsis due to UTI or other infections, progression of heart failure leading to respiratory compromise, and potential complications related to the patient's diabetes mellitus type 2.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and medication effects. Regular assessments of the patient's cardiac function, renal function, and glycemic control should be performed. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and neurologic function is also crucial."

The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF), systolic, and AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Dilated cardiomyopathy is also suspected but its etiology is unclear. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF) and transaminitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening heart failure.
2. Pulmonary edema as a result of left-sided heart failure.
3. Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or atrial flutter.
4. Hypotension and low cardiac output leading to organ hypoperfusion.
5. Progressive renal dysfunction due to prerenal azotemia.
6. Hepatic dysfunction if the transaminitis is related to liver involvement.
7. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and AFib.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA who presents with
   dyspnea x3 days, AFib, and new dilated CM with EF 15-20%.
   PLAN:
   .
   CHF, systolic, new diagnosis:  Pt currently stable. SBP 90s-120s, on
   lasix drip, Cr and LFTs trending down.
   -Continue carvedilol, lasix
   .
   AFib with RVR, new diagnosis:  HR 113-132 on low dose carvedilol,
   heparin gtt. One run of NSVT
   - Continue carvedilol.
   - Start heparin IV gtt
   - Continue ASA 325mg
   - NPO for TEE, possible cardioversion.
   .
   Dilated Cardiomyopathy, new diagnosis:  Unclear etiology.  Given that
   patient has clear lungs, but is in heart failure, likely that this is a
   chronic process.  Pt had cath in [**5-14**] that was normal, performed
   because patient had CP during exercise MIBI (normal) and hypotension.
   EF at that time was > 55%.  Differential includes viral, metabolic,
   hemachromatosis, idiopathic.  Echo did not show evidence of amyloid.
   Patient's Fe studies are normal except for elevated ferritin, and TSH
   is WNL.
   - FU Hepatitis, CMV, EBV serologies; urine/serum tox
   .
   ARF: Cr trending down to 1.7 compared to b/l of 0.8. Likely prerenal.
   - Continue lasix, carvedilol
   - I/Os
   .
   UTI: Positive UA.  Started on cipro in ED for ?UTI, asymptomatic.  Urne
   sample contaminated with epithelial cells.
   - recheck UA, Ucx
   .
   Transaminitis:  Likely related to hypotension/CHF
   - LFTs trending down
   .
   ## DM2: HbA1C <6% on recent evaluation.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presents with dyspnea for three days, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and new dilated cardiomyopathy (CM) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 117 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 106/75 mmHg to 92/63 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97%, and temperature (T) ranging from 36.7°C to 36.8°C. 

The patient has been started on carvedilol, lasix, and heparin IV gtt. The plan includes continuing carvedilol, lasix, and heparin IV gtt. The patient is also being considered for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and possible cardioversion. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), total bilirubin (T Bili), and troponin-T levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range. 

The assessment and plan include congestive heart failure (CHF), systolic, new diagnosis; atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), new diagnosis; dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), new diagnosis; acute renal failure (ARF); urinary tract infection (UTI); transaminitis; diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2); electrolyte imbalance (FEN/Lytes); and bowel regimen. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to the coronary care unit (CCU). 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, infections (such as urinary tract infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia), electrolyte imbalances, and kidney dysfunction."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident. She presents with dyspnea for three days, atrial fibrillation, and a new diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/75 mmHg to 92/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient has been started on carvedilol for rate control in atrial fibrillation, but experienced a run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and was switched to amiodarone. Heparin sodium infusion is ongoing. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and creatinine levels, with trends towards improvement. 

The patient's plan includes continuing lasix for fluid balance and heart failure management, initiating lisinopril for blood pressure control and cardiac support, and further investigations for the etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with dyspnea for three days, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and new dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. The patient is currently stable with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 90s-120s, on a lasix drip, and her creatinine (Cr) and liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. CHF exacerbation: The patient has a new diagnosis of systolic heart failure, and if not managed properly, there is a risk of further exacerbation leading to worsening symptoms and possible cardiac arrest.

2. AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient's heart rate is in the range of 104-130 beats per minute, which indicates uncontrolled AFib. If not appropriately managed with antiarrhythmic medication, there is a risk of developing atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, increasing the risk of thromboembolic events.

3. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has a new diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15-20%. The etiology is unclear, but further evaluation is needed. If left untreated, this"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA who presents with
   dyspnea x3 days, AFib, and new dilated CM with EF 15-20%.
   PLAN:
   .
   CHF, systolic, new diagnosis:  Pt currently stable.
   -Negative 3.6L in 24hrs, Cr trending down.
   -Lasix drip stopped bc systolic bp in 80s.
   -Start Lasix 80mg iv
   -Lisinopril 5mg po daily
   .
   AFib with RVR, new diagnosis:  HR 104-130s.
   - PO amiodarone-loading
   - restart carvedilol
   - re: coumadin-- review neuro/stroke history, consider dc Plavix before
   starting
   - continue heparin IV gtt
   - Continue ASA 325mg
   .
   Dilated Cardiomyopathy, new diagnosis:  Unclear etiology.  Given that
   patient has clear lungs, but is in heart failure, likely that this is a
   chronic process.  Pt had cath in [**5-14**] that was normal, performed
   because patient had CP during exercise MIBI (normal) and hypotension.
   EF at that time was > 55%.
   - FU EBV, HIV, SPEP/UPEP serologies
   .
   ARF: Cr trending down to 1.5 (baseline 0.8). Likely due to
   hypoperfusion.
   - Lisinopril 5mg po
   - I/Os , Cr
   .
   Transaminitis:  Likely related to hypotension/CHF
   - FU LFTs, trending down as of yesterday
   .
   GI/Loose stool
   -FU CDiff studies
   .
   ## DM2: HbA1C <6% on recent evaluation.
   -Will hold oral meds and initiate ISS.
   -Check fsbg
s, meds
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes: replete lytes prn, IVF prn
