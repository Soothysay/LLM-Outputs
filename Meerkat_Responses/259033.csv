   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo F with afib on coumadin, HTN, PVD, h/o TIA and colon CA,
   presented with 10 days of URI symptoms, found to be hypoxic, also with
   melena, supratherapeutic INR and dropping HCT, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   respiratory distress and GI bleed.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Now stable on NC.   likely viral/atypical URT
   infection with reactive airways.  CXR and smoking history consistent
   with COPD.  Although less likely bacterial PNA, TB is a possibility
   given her history and enlarged mediastinal LAD.
   - send viral DFA panel
   - send sputum for gram stain and culture,
   - 3 sputums for AFB
   - send legionella urinary antigen
   - continue ceftriaxone for empiric CAP coverage pending cultures
   - start azithromycin for atypical empiric CAP coverage pending cultures
   - start tamiflu for empiric influenza coverage pending DFA results
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs Q 6hrs standing and Q2 hours
   PRN
   - start methylprednisolone for presumed COPD exacerbation versus
   reactive airways disease
   - continue supplementary O2 as necessary, titrate to sats > 90%
   - low threshold to repeat ABG for worsening respiratory status or
   change in clinical presentation
   .
   #Acute blood loss anemia [**2-10**] GI bleed:  HCT 35.8 -> 33.7 -> 32.9 ->
   29.4.  Melena concerning for upper GI source in the context of
   supratherapeutic INR.  S/P vitamin K, FFP in the ED, INR now 1.6.
   - GI to EGD in AM if INR 1.5.  Will likely postpone given stable HCT
   and ongoing respiratory distress
   - pantoprazole gtt
   - hold coumadin
   - HCT now stable.  Change Q4 hour HCT checks to twice daily
   - no transfusion for now, will consider transfusion for HCT < 27
   - cross match 2 units pRBCs
   -2 large bore IVs, active type and cross
   -check orthostatics once more comfortable from a respiratory standpoint
   -Volume repletion.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 12.5 in the setting of poor PO intake and warfarin
   administration.  Likely due to poor PO/vitamin K deficiency (though
   more rapid than usual).  No drug interactions could be found with her
   anti-tussive medication.
   -hold coumadin
   -Will give FFP for INR >2 or signs of bleeding
   -Trend Coags
   .
   #Diarrhea: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-10**] cathartic effect of melena or may be infectious.
   No risk factors recently for C. Diff.
   -send C. Diff and stool cultures
   .
   #Altered Mental Status: Likely delerium in the setting of GI bleed,
   poor sleep, poor PO intake. CT head negative and no focal neuro signs.
   - serial neuro exam
   - appropriate reorientation of patient
   - PRN Zyprexa if needed
   .
   #A-fib:  At home, rate controlled on metoprolol 100 mg PO daily.  HR
   <110 here, no hypotension.
   - hold metoprolol for concern for hypotension in setting of GI bleed.
   Also, B-blockade will mask tachycardia if re-bleeds.
   - no rhythm control for now
   - INR now 1.6. Hold coumadin until GI bleed resolves.
   - disucss case with cardiologist about restarting coumadin.
   .
   # Hypertension:  At home, on HCTZ, amlodipine and metoprolol.
   Normotensive in ICU
   - hold home meds for now.
   .
   #Hyperbilirubinemia:  T bili mildly elevated.  Unlikely to represent
   biliary problem without [**Name2 (NI) 8576**] pain, more likely due to bleeding.
   Direct bilirubin mildly elevated
   - will follow
   #Hypokalemia: Possibly [**2-10**] GI losses.

   Disposition:  Pending stability of HCT, s/p EGD, able to tolerate
   CLRS,  improvement in respiratory status
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and colon cancer. The patient presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, hypoxia, and melena, and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). There is a possibility of viral or atypical upper respiratory tract infection, and smoking history consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The chest X-ray and enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy raise suspicion for tuberculosis (TB). Further investigations include sending viral DFA panel, sputum for gram stain and culture, 3 sputums for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and urinary antigen for Legionella.

2. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has had a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 35.8 to 29.4, indicating ongoing blood loss. Melena suggests an upper GI source, and the patient received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse the effects of warfarin. The INR has improved from 12.5 to 1.6. The plan is to perform"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and colon cancer. She presented with symptoms of upper respiratory infection (URI), hypoxia, and melena, which indicated a possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and GI bleed.

The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). It is important to closely monitor her respiratory status and ABG results for any worsening respiratory distress or change in clinical presentation.

2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss due to the GI bleed, leading to a decrease in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 35.8% to 29.4%. Close monitoring of HCT levels is necessary, and transfusion may be required if the HCT falls below 27%. Additionally, the patient's INR was initially elevated at 12.5 but has been reversed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is still slightly elevated at 1.6, indicating a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and colon cancer. She presented with respiratory distress and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and GI bleed. She is currently stable on nasal cannula (NC) with likely viral/atypical upper respiratory tract (URT) infection, reactive airways, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She also has acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed, coagulopathy with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 12.5, diarrhea possibly caused by cathartic effect or infectious etiology, altered mental status likely due to delirium, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further due to underlying COPD, viral infection, or bacterial pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial.
2. GI Bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding from the upper GI source, especially with a history of poor oral intake and supratherapeutic INR. Regular monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and HCT levels is important.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status needs close monitoring due to elevated INR and potential for bleeding complications. Trend coagulation studies should be"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, and melena, leading to admission to the ICU for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current conditions include respiratory distress likely due to a viral or atypical upper respiratory infection, acute blood loss anemia from a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed, coagulopathy related to warfarin administration and poor oral intake, diarrhea possibly caused by cathartic effect or infectious etiology, altered mental status likely due to delirium, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperbilirubinemia, hypokalemia, and fluid-electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of melena and the drop in hemoglobin/hematocrit levels suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further anemia and hypotension.
3. Coagulopathy: The elevated initial INR and the administration of warfarin increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the patient's poor oral intake.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient's altered mental status and diarrhea raise concerns for potential infectious"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo F with afib on coumadin, HTN, PVD, h/o TIA and colon CA,
   presented with 10 days of URI symptoms, found to be hypoxic, also with
   melena, supratherapeutic INR and dropping HCT, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   respiratory distress and GI bleed.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Now stable on NC.   likely viral/atypical URT
   infection with reactive airways.  CXR and smoking history consistent
   with COPD.  Although less likely bacterial PNA, TB is a possibility
   given her history and enlarged mediastinal LAD.
   - send viral DFA panel
   - send sputum for gram stain and culture, if possible
   - 3 sputums for AFB, if possible.  Will touch base with PCP to
   determine if has been ruled out for TB in past
   - send legionella urinary antigen
   - continue ceftriaxone for empiric CAP coverage pending cultures
   - start azithromycin for atypical empiric CAP coverage pending cultures
   - start tamiflu for empiric influenza coverage pending DFA results.
   Presently unable to take POs, so will hold for now.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs Q 6hrs standing and Q2 hours
   PRN
   - start methylprednisolone for presumed COPD exacerbation versus
   reactive airways disease
   - start CPAP now for worsening respiratory status and increased work of
   breathing.  continue supplementary O2 as necessary, titrate to sats >
   90%
   - repeat ABG for worsening respiratory status or change in clinical
   presentation
   .
   #Acute blood loss anemia [**2-10**] GI bleed:  HCT 35.8 -> 33.7 -> 32.9 ->
   29.4.  Melena concerning for upper GI source in the context of
   supratherapeutic INR.  S/P vitamin K, FFP in the ED, INR now 1.6.
   - GI to EGD in AM if INR 1.5.  Will likely postpone given stable HCT
   and ongoing respiratory distress
   - pantoprazole gtt
   - hold coumadin
   - HCT now stable.  Change Q4 hour HCT checks to twice daily
   - no transfusion for now, will consider transfusion for HCT < 27
   - cross match 2 units pRBCs
   -2 large bore IVs, active type and cross
   -check orthostatics once more comfortable from a respiratory standpoint
   -Volume repletion.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR 12.5 in the setting of poor PO intake and warfarin
   administration.  Likely due to poor PO/vitamin K deficiency (though
   more rapid than usual).  No drug interactions could be found with her
   anti-tussive medication.
   -hold coumadin
   -Will give FFP for INR >2 or signs of bleeding
   -Trend Coags
   .
   #Diarrhea: [**Month (only) 11**] be [**2-10**] cathartic effect of melena or may be infectious.
   No risk factors recently for C. Diff.
   -send C. Diff and stool cultures
   .
   #Altered Mental Status: Likely delerium in the setting of GI bleed,
   poor sleep, poor PO intake. CT head negative and no focal neuro signs.
   - serial neuro exam
   - appropriate reorientation of patient
   - PRN Zyprexa if needed
   .
   #A-fib:  At home, rate controlled on metoprolol 100 mg PO daily.  HR
   <110 here, no hypotension.
   - hold metoprolol for concern for hypotension in setting of GI bleed.
   Also, B-blockade will mask tachycardia if re-bleeds.
   - no rhythm control for now
   - INR now 1.6. Hold coumadin until GI bleed resolves.
   - disucss case with cardiologist about restarting coumadin.
   .
   # Hypertension:  At home, on HCTZ, amlodipine and metoprolol.
   Normotensive in ICU
   - hold home meds for now.
   .
   #Hyperbilirubinemia:  T bili mildly elevated.  Unlikely to represent
   biliary problem without [**Name2 (NI) 8576**] pain, more likely due to bleeding.
   Direct bilirubin mildly elevated
   - will follow
   #Hypokalemia: Possibly [**2-10**] GI losses.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. They have a history of COPD and an enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which increases the possibility of a lung infection, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. Appropriate interventions have been initiated, including the administration of antibiotics, antivirals, and bronchodilators. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial.

2. GI bleed: The patient experienced melena, which is indicative of an upper gastrointestinal bleed. This is concerning, especially in the context of a supratherapeutic INR. The patient received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse the effects of warfarin and improve their coagulation status. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and vital signs is essential.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR was elevated at 12.5 due to poor oral intake and warfarin administration. This places them at risk for excessive bleeding. Coumadin has been held, and FFP has been given to correct the coagulopathy. Frequent monitoring of INR levels is necessary.

4. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium, possibly due to factors such as poor sleep, poor oral intake, and the GI bleed. Reorientation and regular neurologic assessments should be conducted."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues. They have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acidosis, coagulopathy, and delirium. The patient's current condition includes wheezing, anxiety, and respiratory distress. They are also experiencing volume depletion, as evidenced by dry oral mucosa and orthostatic pulse changes. The patient's laboratory results show low hemoglobin levels, elevated white blood cell count, abnormal liver function tests, and imbalances in electrolytes. The patient is currently on various medications, including bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics. They have a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status and are currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening work of breathing suggest a high risk of respiratory failure. Immediate intervention, such as intubation and mechanical ventilation, may be necessary.
2. Infection: The presence of pneumonia and ongoing antibiotic use indicates a risk of infection. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance is essential.
3. Bleeding: Despite correction of coagulopathy, the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding raises concerns about potential bleeding complications, especially if anticoagulation therapy is required.
4. Acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels remain low, indicating ongoing acidosis. Proper management of acid-base balance is crucial to prevent"

   # Respiratory distress: Increased wob on face mask with appropriate O2
   sats.   Likely viral/atypical URT infection with reactive airways.  CXR
   and smoking history consistent with COPD.  Although less likely
   bacterial PNA, TB is a possibility given her history and enlarged
   mediastinal LAD.
   - send viral DFA panel

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, previous transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, and melena. She was admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress likely due to a viral or atypical infection with reactive airways, acute blood loss anemia from a presumed upper gastrointestinal bleed, coagulopathy with an elevated INR, altered mental status, and electrolyte imbalances. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with various medications including antibiotics, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleed could worsen, leading to continued blood loss, hemodynamic instability, and potential need for transfusion.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and supratherapeutic coagulation status increase the risk of bleeding, especially if the patient undergoes invasive procedures or experiences additional gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to her age and current condition increases the risk of developing secondary infections, including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, or bloodstream infections.

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms and was found to be hypoxic, also with melena and a supratherapeutic INR. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise due to her current condition and medical history. Some potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and required intubation. She has been placed on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to the use of positive pressure ventilation.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, as indicated by melena and a low hemoglobin concentration. There is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the underlying cause of the initial bleed is not addressed.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR due to Coumadin administration and poor oral intake. This increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if the patient undergoes invasive procedures or if there is further gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Diarrhea: The patient has experienced diarrhea, which may be due to the cathartic effect of the gastrointestinal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, and melena. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, acute blood loss anemia, coagulopathy, diarrhea, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory status due to underlying COPD and potential complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary hypertension.
2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin levels due to gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. Further bleeding or inadequate oxygenation may worsen the condition.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated INR due to poor oral intake and warfarin administration. This increases the risk of bleeding, especially if the patient requires invasive procedures or if there is ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which may be due to the cathartic effect of melena or an infectious cause. Monitoring for signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances is crucial"

   ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   =================
   Patient has made substantial improvement over the past 12 hours.
   Oxygenation much improved as is CXR; both suggest that we have
   recruited alveoli. Patient was suctioned for considerable secretions;
   these may have contributed to her wheezing and airway resistance. Would
   quickly wean prednisone. If she continues to do well, would reduce PEEP
   to 10 (placed on FIO2 of 0.4 during rounds). I am less convinced that
   she has ARDS now. Will reduce sedation and as she awakens, will switch
   to PSV.
   Continue present antibiotics. DFA negative for influenza.
   Hct down a few points. No bowel movements. Not at transfusion
   threshold. No coffee grounds in gastric aspirate. Continue to monitor.
   BUN/Creat ratio elevated and urine output is low. I think she may be
   somewhat volume depleted. Would bolus with crystalloid today to see if
   urine output responds.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, COPD, pneumonia, GI bleed, and anemia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has shown substantial improvement over the past 12 hours. Oxygenation has improved, and there are signs of recruited alveoli on chest X-ray. The patient was suctioned for secretions, which may have contributed to wheezing and airway resistance. It is planned to quickly wean prednisone, reduce PEEP to 10, and switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV) as the patient awakens. The patient is currently sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be a result of respiratory failure and pneumonia.
2. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, possibly due to the critical condition and invasive procedures.
3. Wheezing: The patient is experiencing wheezing, which could be caused by bronchospasm or airway resistance.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GI Bleed/GIB): The patient has a history of GI bleed, and it is important to monitor for any signs of ongoing bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be a result of chronic blood loss or acute blood loss from the GI bleed.
6. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to COP"

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, melena, and a supratherapeutic INR. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's respiratory status improved with pressure support ventilation and she is now on assist-control ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. She has a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score of -1, indicating minimal sedation.

The patient's blood pressure is stable, but her heart rate is in the low 100s and increased to the 120s with agitation. She has a history of hypertension and is currently on hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, and metoprolol. Her home medications are being held in the ICU.

Her hemoglobin concentration has been decreasing due to acute blood loss from a gastrointestinal bleed. She received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma in the emergency department to correct her supratherapeutic INR, which is now stable at 1.3.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer.
- The patient presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, and melena. She was admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient is currently in the ICU and is being managed for several conditions including respiratory distress, acute blood loss anemia, neurologic symptoms, coagulopathy, diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.
- The patient's respiratory distress is improving, but there are still barriers to extubation such as pulmonary edema and atelectasis. The decision to extubate the patient will depend on her diuresis and overall clinical picture.
- The patient's acute blood loss anemia is being managed with close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and administration of vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to correct the coagulopathy.
- The patient experienced myoclonic movements and temporary fixed lateral gaze, which were likely side effects of fentanyl. The sedation regimen has been adjusted to minimize these effects.
- The patient's coagulopathy is stable with an INR of 1.3.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being managed with low-dose metoprolol.
- The patient's hypertension is well-controlled in the ICU, and"

","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is respiratory failure, COPD, pneumonia, anemia, and GI bleed. The patient is currently intubated and on positive pressure ventilation support. The vital signs show a stable heart rate and blood pressure, but the patient has a positive fluid balance of 2.4 liters from yesterday.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume of 0, spontaneous tidal volume of 366-525 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 38, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 263.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, hypoxemia, anxiety, wheezing, gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, and possible volume overload. The patient is expected to be diuresed of 1-1.5 liters negative and assessed for extubation at that time. The wheezing has resolved, and the patient's hemoglobin level is stable without evidence of active bleeding. The"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient had URI symptoms and was found to be hypoxic with melena. She also had a supratherapeutic INR and dropping HCT.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate in the range of 104-129 bpm with intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 150/65mmHg to 170/87mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 58.3 kg.

The patient is currently receiving tube feeds, which were held since 4am. She is NPO pending speech and swallow evaluation. The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative 2 L since yesterday.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is being managed with pressure support ventilation (PSV/SBT) and weaning off sedation. The plan is to extubate the patient today.

2. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient had melena in the emergency department, suggesting an upper gastrointestinal bleed. She received vitamin K and fresh frozen"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and a history of transient ischemic attack and colon cancer. The patient presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, and melena, and was admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), a heart rate of 104 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 150/65 mmHg to 170/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight is 58.3 kg, and height is 62 inches.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with pressure support mode set at 5 cmH2O, spontaneous breaths allowed, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 29, and tidal volume (Vt) of 530 mL during spontaneous breaths.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 26.0%, platelet count of 279 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 27 mmHg, glucose level of 151 mg/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3.

The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement in pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and atelectasis. The assessment and plan include respiratory distress, acute blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding, leukocytosis, coagulopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate a potential risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to high pressures during ventilation.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's melena and supratherapeutic INR suggest a risk for ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and coagulation parameters is necessary to identify any signs of re-bleeding.

3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammation. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results should be monitored to determine the cause of leukocytosis and to guide appropriate treatment.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates a bleeding tendency"

   a couple of hours and continued to do well on PS 8/5.  Now on PS 5/5.
   SBT successful x 1 hr with one period of apnea attributed to mucous
   plug.  Possible barriers to extubation include: pulmonary edema,
   atelectasis on lower PEEP
   - try to extubate today.  Decision by 5 pm depending on diuresis and
   overall clinical picture
   - f/u sputum culture and 2 remaining sputum AFB
   - continue ceftriaxone for empiric CAP coverage pending cultures, total
   7 day course
   - continue azithromycin for atypical empiric CAP coverage pending
   cultures, total 7 day course
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium inhalers Q 6hrs standing and Q2

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, previous transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She presented with symptoms of upper respiratory infection and was found to be hypoxic with melena. She also had a supratherapeutic INR and dropping hemoglobin concentration, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been weaned off sedation and is tolerating the ventilator settings well. However, agitation was observed overnight with a heart rate in the 120s, and there were motions to remove the tube. Sedation was increased, and metoprolol 12.5 mg PO was given, which responded with a heart rate of 80s-90s. Tube feeds were stopped at 4 am.

The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and she is being treated empirically with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia. She is also receiving albuterol and ipratropium inhalers every 6 hours standing and as needed for respiratory symptoms. A rapid taper of methylprednisolone is planned. Diuresis has been initiated with 20 mg IV lasix, aiming for a net negative 1 L fluid balance.

The patient has experienced acute blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding, with a significant drop in hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They are currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anemia. The patient's secretions have improved overnight, and they have been diuresed. There is a leak around the endotracheal tube when the cuff is emptied, and the patient's respiratory system is stable. The patient's gag reflex is minimal, so they need to be closely monitored regarding their ability to handle secretions today. Speech and swallow evaluation will be conducted. The patient is maintaining a negative fluid balance of 0.5-1.0 L today. Their white blood cell count is elevated, but they are afebrile (on steroids). They are completing their course of antibiotics, and a third acid-fast bacilli (AFB) test has been sent. The patient's hematocrit level is stable, and there is no evidence of active bleeding. They are not at the threshold for transfusion. Steroids will continue to be tapered. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation puts them at risk for developing VAP. Monitoring for new or worsening respiratory symptoms, such as fever, increased sputum production, and changes in oxygenation, should be done. Frequent cultures of sputum may also be necessary.
2. Nosocomial infection: Due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, they"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, pneumonia, GI bleed, and anemia. The patient has been sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with PSV mode. They have been diuresed with a negative fluid balance. The patient's secretions have improved, and their gag reflex is minimal. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but they are afebrile. They are completing a course of antibiotics and have sent third AFB cultures. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable, and there is no evidence of active bleeding. The plan is to continue tapering steroids, maintaining negative fluid balance, and closely monitoring the patient's ability to handle secretions.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: Being in the ICU setting for a prolonged duration increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots, such as DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Improper ventilation settings or prolonged mechanical ventilation can cause VILI.
6. Barotrauma:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, and melena. She was admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient was extubated on [**10-17**] and has been on supplemental oxygen, which has been weaned to 2LNC. She has a negative AFB culture x 3, and respiratory isolation has been discontinued. She will continue with ceftriaxone for empirical coverage of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pending cultures, on a day [**6-15**] day course. Azithromycin will also be continued for atypical CAP coverage, on a day [**5-15**] day course. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium will be given Q6hrs standing and Q2 hours PRN. Methylprednisolone rapid taper will be initiated, transitioning to oral medications. The patient's poor oral intake will be followed up while on a new diet, with IV fluids as necessary.

The patient's acute blood loss anemia is related to a gastrointestinal bleed, which occurred in the emergency department. She received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the ED, leading to a decrease in IN"

She presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, and melena. She was admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has been extubated and is on supplemental oxygen, saturating well on 4L NC this morning. She continues to receive ceftriaxone for empirical coverage of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pending cultures, along with a 6-day course. Azithromycin is also being administered for atypical coverage of CAP pending cultures, with a 5-day course. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium are given every 6 hours standing and as needed. Methylprednisolone rapid taper, 25% per day, was completed today as the last day of IV steroids. The patient is negative for fluid balance over the past 24 hours, appears to be mobilizing her edema, and will follow up on her oral intake while on a new diet. IV fluids will be given if necessary.

Regarding acute blood loss anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable. Melena in the emergency department is concerning for an upper gastrointestinal source in the context of a supratherapeutic INR. She received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FF"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She presented with 10 days of upper respiratory infection symptoms, hypoxia, and melena. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent extubation on 10/17 and is currently receiving supplemental oxygen. She has been receiving ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia, as well as albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers every 6 hours and as needed. Methylprednisolone rapid taper is being continued until today, which is the last day of IV steroids. The patient has a negative fluid balance of 3.5 liters over the past 24 hours and appears to be mobilizing her edema. Her INR was initially elevated but has since dropped after receiving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma in the emergency department. There is no evidence of active bleeding currently, and the patient appears stable. Coumadin has been held in the setting of the bleed, and aspirin has been held in preparation for an upcoming esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is being continued. The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to IV steroids, but there is a consideration of new infection. The patient's heart rate is"

   88 yo F with afib on coumadin, HTN, PVD, h/o TIA and colon CA,
   presented with 10 days of URI symptoms, found to be hypoxic, also with
   melena, supratherapeutic INR and dropping HCT, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   respiratory distress and GI bleed.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:   Patient is s/p extubation on [**10-17**],
   supplemental oxygen , saturating well on 4L NC this AM
   - continue ceftriaxone for empiric CAP coverage pending cultures, day
   [**6-15**] day course

   cultures, day [**5-15**] day course
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs Q 6hrs standing and Q2 hours
   PRN
   - methylprednisolone rapid taper, 25% per day
 today was last day of IV
   steroids
   - patient negative 3.5L over the past 24 hours, appears to be
   mobilizing her edema
 will re-assess I/Os in afternoon and make her
   goal I/O net -1L for the day
   .
   #Acute blood loss anemia [**2-10**] GI bleed:  HCT stable.  Melena in ED
   concerning for upper GI source in the context of supratherapeutic INR.
   S/P vitamin K, FFP in the ED, INR initially dropped to 1.2.   No
   evidence of active bleeding currently, appears stable.
   - hold coumadin in setting of bleed; hold aspirin in case of upcoming
   EGD in next few days
   - ask GI about possible endoscopy over weekend, b/c concerned about
   holding coumadin for too long
 risk of thrombus formation and stroke
   risk
   - continue PPI
   #Leukocytosis:  stable.  Likely elevated WBC from IV steroids, but
   consider possibility of new infection.    Last dose of IV steroids
   today.
   - monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #A-fib:  better HR control post extubation
   - on PO metoprolol
   - follow heart rates
   .
   # Hypertension:  At home, on HCTZ, amlodipine and metoprolol.
   Normotensive in ICU
   - can switch to home dose of metoprolol on floor
   - restart amlodipine
   - hold HCTZ for now

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   I examined the patient , reviewed  her history and hospital course and
   was present for the key portion of the services provided.  I have also
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8562**]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of care.
   The patient has improved dramatically over the past few days and is now
   alert, appropriate, engaging and without resp distress.  Her resp
   failure, now resolved seems to have been from a combination for
   pneumonia and CHF and I suspect the latter may have been from Afib and
   anemia from GI bleed in the setting of IV fluid resuscitation.  On exam
   she is still somewhat wet with rales, and we will aim for her I/O to be
   1.5 L neg today. But I wouldn
t dry her out to much too fast while she
   is still coughing up any purulent sputum.  She is now off any stroke
   preventive Rx, given her melena. I would favor an EGD assessment this
   admission if possible and from then decide what form of anticoagulation
   she could be sent home on.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, transient ischemic attack, and colon cancer. She was admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory distress: The patient is post-extubation and is receiving supplemental oxygen, which she is saturating well on 4L NC.
- Acute blood loss anemia: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed, but her hemoglobin level is stable, and there is no evidence of active bleeding currently.
- Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to IV steroids or a new infection. The last dose of IV steroids was given today, and the patient's WBC and fever curve should be monitored.
- Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is better controlled post-extubation. She is on oral metoprolol and will be followed closely for heart rates.
- Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently normal in the ICU. She can switch to her home dose of metoprolol on the floor, restart amlodipine, and hold HCTZ for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress has improved, but there is still a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if she develops pneumonia or congestive heart failure again"
