   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 25 y.o.f. with h/o mixed connective tissue disorder
   and interstitial lung disease who presented with headache, mental
   status changes, and agitation.
   # MS changes
 Most likely etiology is meningitis vs encephalitis (HA,
   but altered MS making either a possibility) in the setting of symptoms,
   leukocytosis, and CSF findings.  Tox screen negative and no history of
   illicits.  Etiology of meningitis unclear at this point (gram stain
   unrevealing), but likely bacterial rather than viral, although both
   possible.  Listeria highest on differential at this point given
   prodrome and likely deficient cell mediated immunity in setting of
   chronic prednisone.  Does not appear to be meningococcus as no rash and
   would be sicker.  Pneumococcal, hemophilus possible.  Also must
   consider staph and GNR, but no recent surgery or advanced medical
   illness.   Given prednisone must also consider cryptococcus.  Could
   also consider EEE, west [**Doctor First Name 1871**], and [**Location (un) 2390**] encephalitis, although
   season may not be consistent.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for
   pneumococcus, staph species, and listeria, respectively
   - Empiric acyclovir for possible HSV
   - F/U CSF culture  - viral, fungal, bacterial -> gram stain negative,
   no cryptococcal antigen detected
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Treat with HD steroids both for relative adrenal insufficiency and
   for meningitis
   - F/U blood cultures
   - Consider EEE and west [**Doctor First Name 1871**] PCR on CSF, per ID, too early in the year
   but still a consideration
   - Based on records, patient does not appear to have a recent PPD, will
   consider placing today given chronic steroid use
   - C3 and C4 within normal limits
   - Cryoglobulins pending
   - MRI with/without gado of brain per ID today
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubation for airway protection in the setting
   of meningitis.  Will likely be able to be extubated quickly, but would
   keep intubated until antibiotics can take effect and improve
   MS/agitation.  Patient started on presedex for sedation/analgesia and
   patient became very agitated. Required resedation with propofol and
   versed.  Difficult to assess if agitation was due to waking up from
   sedation intubated, or if this represented continued delirium [**2-10**]
   whatever process is going on.  Patient was minimally following commands
   at that time.  During the night, nursing states she was following
   commands briefly.
   - Keep patient intubated today until after MRI (will determine at what
   time it should occur)
   - Continue AC for now, will attempt to lighten sedation to assess
   mental status. Change to PSV if able.  Can consider longer trial of
   presedex today with slower propofol wean to transition without acute
   agitation.
   # Leukocytosis
 Improved today.  Etiology likely meningitis.  UA
   negative. CXR unrevealing for acute infiltrate.
   - Empiric abx as above
   - F/U urine, blood, CSF cultures
   - Monitor fever and WBC trend
   # ILD
 Due to MCTD.   Improved on steroids and these have been tapered
   over the last few months.  Last PFTs stable when compared to prior.
   Prednisone decreased to 10 mg daily in [**3-17**]. Stopped atovaquone for PCP
   px on [**4-23**].  Plan was for rheumatology f/u and if inflammatory markers
   decreased, decrease prednisone to QOD for 2-3 months.  Currently
   stable.
   - Steroids
   - F/U with pulmonary as outpatient as planned
   # Metabolic acidosis - Anion gap of 25 on admission.  Serum and urine
   tox screens negative.  No osm gap.  No renal failure.  No evidence of
   DKA as no glucose or ketones in urine.  Lactate elevated and this is
   likely cause.
   - IVFs
   - Repeat lactate trending down
   - Recheck lactate today

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of mixed connective tissue disorder and interstitial lung disease. She presented with headache, mental status changes, and agitation. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has leukocytosis, likely secondary to meningitis, and is being treated empirically with antibiotics for bacterial meningitis, including coverage for Listeria. Acyclovir has also been started for possible HSV encephalitis. Steroids have been initiated for relative adrenal insufficiency and meningitis. Blood cultures are pending, and further tests such as MRI of the brain, CSF analysis, and HSV PCR are planned. The patient's ILD is stable on steroids, and she will be followed up with rheumatology as an outpatient. Metabolic acidosis is present, likely caused by an elevated lactate level, which is trending down with IVFs. The patient is NPO and on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP precautions in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has signs and symptoms consistent with meningitis, including headache, mental status changes, and agitation. Empiric antibiotics have been started, but the causative organism is still unclear.
2. HSV Encephalitis: The patient may have HSV encephalitis, which is being treated with ac"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 25 y.o.f. with h/o mixed connective tissue disorder
   and interstitial lung disease who presented with headache, mental
   status changes, and agitation.
   # MS changes
 Most likely etiology is meningitis vs encephalitis (HA,
   but altered MS making either a possibility) in the setting of symptoms,
   leukocytosis, and CSF findings.  Tox screen negative and no history of
   illicits.  Etiology of meningitis unclear at this point (gram stain
   unrevealing), but likely bacterial rather than viral, although both
   possible.  Listeria highest on differential at this point given
   prodrome and likely deficient cell mediated immunity in setting of
   chronic prednisone.  Does not appear to be meningococcus as no rash and
   would be more sick.  Pneumococcal, hemophilus possible.  Also must
   consider staph and GNR, but no recent surgery or advanced medical
   illness.   Given prednisone must also consider cryptococcus.  Could
   also consider EEE, west [**Doctor First Name 1871**], and [**Location (un) 2390**] encephalitis, although
   season may not be consistent.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for
   pneumococcus, staph species, and listeria, respectively
   - Treat with HD steroids both for relative adrenal insufficiency and
   for meningitis
   - Empiric acyclovir for possible HSV
   - F/U CSF culture  - viral, fungal, bacterial -> gram stain negative,
   no cryptococcal antigen detected
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - F/U blood cultures
   - Consider EEE and west [**Doctor First Name 1871**] PCR on CSF, per ID, too early in the year
   but still a consideration
   - Based on records, patient does not appear to have a recent PPD, will
   consider placing today given chronic steroid use
   - C3 and C4 within normal limits
   - Cryoglobulins pending
   - MRI with/without gado of brain per ID today
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubation for airway protection in the setting
   of meningitis.  Will likely be able to be extubated quickly, but would
   keep intubated until antibiotics can take effect and improve
   MS/agitation.  Patient started on presedex for sedation/analgesia and
   patient became very agitated. Required resedation with propofol and
   versed bolus.  Difficult to assess if agitation was due to waking up
   from sedation intubated, or if this represented continued delirium [**2-10**]
   whatever underlying process is ongoing.  Patient was minimally
   following commands at that time.  During the night, nursing states she
   was following commands briefly.
   - Keep patient intubated today until after MRI (will determine at what
   time it should occur)
   - Continue AC for now, will attempt to lighten sedation (propofol) to
   assess mental status. Fentanyl/ativan boluses prn agitation.  Change to
   PSV if able.  Can consider longer trial of presedex today with slower
   propofol wean to transition without acute agitation if weaning propofol
   alone with boluses is unsuccessful.
   # ILD
 Due to MCTD.   Improved on steroids and these have been tapered
   over the last few months.  Last PFTs stable when compared to prior.
   Prednisone decreased to 10 mg daily in [**3-17**]. Stopped atovaquone for PCP
   px on [**4-23**].  Plan was for rheumatology f/u and if inflammatory markers
   decreased, decrease prednisone to QOD for 2-3 months.  Currently
   stable.
   - Steroids as above
   - F/U with pulmonary as outpatient as planned
   # Metabolic acidosis
 Resolved. Anion gap of 25 on admission.  Serum
   and urine tox screens negative.  No osm gap.  No renal failure.  No
   evidence of DKA as no glucose or ketones in urine.  Lactate elevated
   and this was likely cause.
   - IVFs
   - Repeat lactate trending down
   - Recheck lactate today

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of mixed connective tissue disorder and interstitial lung disease. She presented with symptoms of headache, mental status changes, and agitation. She was found to have leukocytosis and CSF findings consistent with meningitis or encephalitis. Empirical treatment has been initiated with antibiotics and steroids. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and is being sedated with propofol. Her ILD is being managed with steroids, and she will follow up with pulmonary as an outpatient. The metabolic acidosis that was present has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis/Encephalitis: The patient's symptoms, leukocytosis, and CSF findings suggest an infection of the central nervous system. This could potentially lead to further deterioration in mental status and neurological function if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. If the underlying cause of her respiratory failure is not addressed, there is a risk of further deterioration and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Complications related to Steroid Use: The patient is on chronic steroid therapy for her ILD. Prolonged use of steroids can lead to various complications such as immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to infections, adrenal insufficiency, and osteoporosis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to"

   2. Sepsis with elevated lactate- lactate improved, hemodynamically
   stable
   Good urine output. No further fluid resuscitation overnight.
    3. Resp failure- in setting of airway protection.
   At high risk for severe resp failure with any VAP, vent associated
   complication.
   After brain MRI will try to wean propofol, bolus ativan and fentanyl as
   needed. If bolus needs are too high-- leaning towards interfering with
   vent drive, will try dexmedetomidine to try to extubate.
   4. Metabolic acidosis normalized, no osm gap.
   5. Nutrition: deferred until after MRI and attempt at extubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 25 y.o.f. with h/o mixed connective tissue disorder
   and interstitial lung disease who presented with headache, mental
   status changes, and agitation.
    # MS changes
 Most likely etiology is meningitis vs encephalitis (HA,
   but altered MS making either a possibility) in the setting of symptoms,
   leukocytosis, and CSF findings.  Tox screen negative and no history of
   illicits.  Etiology of meningitis unclear at this point (gram stain
   unrevealing), but likely bacterial rather than viral, although both
   possible.  Listeria highest on differential at this point given
   prodrome and likely deficient cell mediated immunity in setting of
   chronic prednisone.  Does not appear to be meningococcus as no rash and
   would be more sick.  Pneumococcal, hemophilus possible.  Also must
   consider staph and GNR, but no recent surgery or advanced medical
   illness.   Given prednisone must also consider cryptococcus.  Could
   also consider EEE, west [**Doctor First Name 1871**], and [**Location (un) 2390**] encephalitis, although
   season may not be consistent.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for
   pneumococcus, staph species, and listeria, respectively
   - Treat with HD steroids both for relative adrenal insufficiency and
   for meningitis
   - Empiric acyclovir for possible HSV
   - F/U CSF culture  - viral, fungal, bacterial -> gram stain negative,
   no cryptococcal antigen detected
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - F/U blood cultures
   - Consider EEE and west [**Doctor First Name 1871**] PCR on CSF, per ID, too early in the year
   but still a consideration
   - Based on records, patient does not appear to have a recent PPD, will
   consider placing today given chronic steroid use
   - C3 and C4 within normal limits
   - Cryoglobulins pending
   - MRI with/without gado of brain per ID today
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubation for airway protection in the setting
   of meningitis.  Will likely be able to be extubated quickly, but would
   keep intubated until antibiotics can take effect and improve
   MS/agitation.  Patient started on presedex for sedation/analgesia and
   patient became very agitated. Required resedation with propofol and
   versed bolus.  Difficult to assess if agitation was due to waking up
   from sedation intubated, or if this represented continued delirium [**2-10**]
   whatever underlying process is ongoing.  Patient was minimally
   following commands at that time.  During the night, nursing states she
   was following commands briefly.
   - Keep patient intubated today until after MRI (will determine at what
   time it should occur)
   - Continue AC for now, will attempt to lighten sedation (propofol) to
   assess mental status. Fentanyl/ativan boluses prn agitation.  Change to
   PSV if able.  Can consider longer trial of presedex today with slower
   propofol wean to transition without acute agitation if weaning propofol
   alone with boluses is unsuccessful.
   # ILD
 Due to MCTD.   Improved on steroids and these have been tapered
   over the last few months.  Last PFTs stable when compared to prior.
   Prednisone decreased to 10 mg daily in [**3-17**]. Stopped atovaquone for PCP
   px on [**4-23**].  Plan was for rheumatology f/u and if inflammatory markers
   decreased, decrease prednisone to QOD for 2-3 months.  Currently
   stable.
   - Steroids as above
   - F/U with pulmonary as outpatient as planned
   # Metabolic acidosis
 Resolved. Anion gap of 25 on admission.  Serum
   and urine tox screens negative.  No osm gap.  No renal failure.  No
   evidence of DKA as no glucose or ketones in urine.  Lactate elevated
   and this was likely cause.
   - IVFs
   - Repeat lactate trending down
   - Recheck lactate today

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of mixed connective tissue disorder (MCTD) and pulmonary interstitial disease. She presented with headache, mental status changes, and agitation. The patient was extubated and started on antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for suspected bacterial meningitis. Empiric acyclovir was also started for possible HSV encephalitis. The patient's condition improved, but she remains intubated due to respiratory failure and agitation. She is currently being sedated with propofol and versed, and will undergo an MRI of the brain to further evaluate her symptoms. Her metabolic acidosis has resolved, and she is being closely monitored in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms of headache, mental status changes, and agitation are suggestive of meningitis. She is already receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy for bacterial meningitis, including coverage for Listeria, pneumococcus, and other possible pathogens.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitated intubation for airway protection. She is expected to improve with treatment, but ongoing respiratory support may be required until her mental status stabilizes.
3. HSV Encephalitis: Although less likely than bacterial meningitis, the patient is receiving empiric treatment with acyclovir for possible HSV encephalitis. Further testing, such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of mixed connective tissue disorder (MCTD) and pulmonary interstitial disease. She presented with symptoms of headache, mental status changes, and agitation. She was intubated for suspected respiratory failure due to myositis (MS) changes but has now been extubated and is maintaining good oxygen saturation. The patient is currently being treated empirically for meningitis with a combination of antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin) and antiviral medication (acyclovir) due to possible HSV encephalitis. Her meningitis is being managed with high-dose steroids. 

The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and her ILD is currently stable. However, she will require further pulmonary follow-up as an outpatient. The patient also had resolved metabolic acidosis. She is receiving regular diet and her glycemic control is adequate. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with a heparin lock, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and she will need to be transferred to the floor with continued empirical antibiotic coverage until the etiology of her condition is known.

Potential medical complications:
1. Meningitis/Encephalitis: The patient is still being treated empirically for meningitis/encephalitis, and the source of infection remains unclear."

   Assessment and Plan
   25 yo female with history of MCTD and admit with mental status changes
   and positive LP. She has now had improved mental status and stability
   of ventilatory support.  Unifying diagnosis still remains to be defined
   but viral source of meningitis may well be at play--differential is
   obviously more extensive than that and empiric coverage is in place.  I
   would add the temporal lobe focus of seizure would be reasonable to
   consider as well.
   1)Respiratory Failure
with mental status improved she has tolerated
   extubation.
   -On room air
   -OOB to ambulate today
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -CNS infection possible and suggested by increased WBC count
   -Continue with Acyclovir/Amp/CTX/Vanco
   -Appreciate ID support and input.
   -Await final cultures
   -Dexamethasone to continue given MRI findings but with clinical
   improvement may be able to consider D/C and certainly at 4 days.

- The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of MCTD (Mixed Connective Tissue Disease) admitted with mental status changes and positive LP (lumbar puncture).
- She has shown improvement in mental status and stability of ventilatory support.
- The unifying diagnosis is still uncertain, but viral meningitis is being considered as a possibility.
- Empiric antibiotic coverage is in place.
- The patient tolerated extubation and is now on room air.
- She is expected to ambulate today.
- The patient's altered mental status could be due to CNS infection, as suggested by the increased WBC count.
- The current medications include Acyclovir, Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin.
- Dexamethasone will continue to be administered due to MRI findings, but may be discontinued if clinical improvement is observed.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor today.
- ICU care includes nutrition via PO intake, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures such as LMW heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcers, and monitoring for VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, but her condition has improved, allowing for extubation. However, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if she"
