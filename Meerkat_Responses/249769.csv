   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The chief complaints include hypotension, aspiration pneumonia, fever, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient has been given 4 liters of intravenous fluid since admission, which has improved blood pressure. The patient's temperature has also improved since being admitted to the ICU.

The patient requires oxygen by mask to maintain acceptable saturation levels. Creatinine levels are improving with fluid administration. However, the patient continues to experience metabolic acidosis.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (AFIB), constipation (obstipation, fos), cerebrovascular accident (CVA or stroke), dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct), depression, pneumonia, aspiration, aortic aneurysm (TAA), anemia, acute renal failure, and hypocalcemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals several findings. The patient is well-nourished but overweight or obese. They have no acute distress and show no signs of anxiety, diaphoresis, or other abnormalities. The patient's eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat appear normal. Cardiovascular examination shows no abnormal heart sounds, murmurs, rubs, or signs of peripheral vascular disease. Respiratory examination reveals diffuse upper airway rhonchi primarily on exhalation, indicating possible aspiration pneumonia. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present and no signs of distention or tenderness. Ext"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), recurrent aspiration, and urinary tract infections (UTIs). He presented with fever, tachypnea, and suspected aspiration, now with computed tomography (CT) abdomen suggesting acute cholecystitis. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is not a candidate for surgery. The healthcare team contacted interventional radiology (IR) for percutaneous cholecystostomy, but the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) was 5.3, which needs to be brought down to 1.5. Vitamin K was administered to reduce the INR. Blood culture grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, pending speciation. The patient received one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for possible line, with a PICC line placed in the morning.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Cholecystitis: The patient has a CT abdomen showing signs of acute cholecystitis. This condition involves inflammation of the gallbladder, usually due to gallstones blocking the cystic duct.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration and now presents with possible right lower lobe infiltrate and bilateral lower lobe consolidation on CT abdomen. This indicates a potential respiratory complication, possibly pneumonia or pneumonitis.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's initial urinalysis ("

   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Improving. Pt afebrile with decreasing white
   count. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to acute cholecystitis and/or aspiration pneumonia
   and/or UTI.
   - f/u urine, blood cx
   - continue empiric Vanc/Zosyn, Flagyl

   # Obstructive cholestasis/cholecystitis:  HIDA suggests acute
   cholecystitis. No surgical intervention at this time. No need for
   percutaneous cholecystostomy.
   - trend LFTs, fractionate bili
   - follow abd exam
   -continue antibiotics for acute cholecystitis

   # Hypoxia: resolving. Most likely due to aspiration pneumonia
   - cover empirically with Vanc/Zosyn

   # Fecal impaction: hold off on starting bowel regimen for now as pt
   having liquid stool around impaction
   - consider enema
   .
   # s/p PE on coumadin: INR continues to be supratherapeutic at 4.3.
   Received Vitamin K and FFP for possible IR procedure.
   - hold coumadin for now, trend coags

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), recurrent aspiration, and urinary tract infections (UTIs).
- He presented with fever, tachypnea, and suspected aspiration, and now has a CT abdomen concerning for cholecystitis.
- The patient's fever and leukocytosis are improving, but he remains at risk for aspiration pneumonia, UTI, and acute cholecystitis.
- He has obstructive cholestasis/cholecystitis with a HIDA scan suggesting acute cholecystitis. Surgical intervention is not indicated at this time.
- The patient's hypoxia is resolving, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. Empirical coverage with Vanc/Zosyn is being provided.
- He has acute renal failure (ARF) that is improving, and efforts are being made to maintain urine output and follow up with urine culture.
- Fecal impaction is present, and a bowel regimen is planned once the impaction resolves.
- The patient is on Coumadin and has a supratherapeutic INR. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) have been given for possible interventional radiology (IR) procedure.
- The patient has ""locked in"" syndrome and is maintained on diazepam for contractures.
- The patient is NPO"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of cholecystitis and coagulopathy.
- HPI: The patient has a history of stroke, pneumonia, depression, dementia, aortic aneurysm, and cholecystitis.
- 24-hour events: The patient received antibiotics for cholecystitis and showed improvement. They were unable to provide history due to a previous stroke.
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate is 62 bpm, blood pressure is 106/50 mmHg, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination: The patient appears well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. There are no endotracheal, NG, or OG tubes present. Cardiovascular examination reveals a normal PMI and S1, distant S2, and no murmurs, S3, or S4 sounds. Peripheral pulses are not assessed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 82-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, constipation, previous cerebrovascular accident (stroke), dementia (including Alzheimer's and multi-infarct), depression, pneumonia, aspiration, aortic aneurysm (TAA), and anemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been treated with various antibiotics for an infection positive for staph. The patient's WBC count is improving, and femoral line has been removed. There are concerns about potential complications such as bleeding, fluid balance, and potential heart rhythm disturbances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for any signs of bleeding or abnormal clotting times is necessary.
2. Fluid Balance: The patient's total fluid intake exceeds their total fluid output, resulting in a negative fluid balance. This indicates that the patient is losing more fluids than they are taking in. Monitoring the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure, is important to prevent hypotension and ensure adequate organ perfusion.
3. Heart Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rhythm. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm to prevent any further complications related to cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: Although the patient's WBC count is improving"
