 ANXIETY
   41yo gentleman with metastatic melanoma admitted with likely
   post-obstructive pneumonia.
   # Shortness of breath and fevers:
   Likely from post-obstructive pneumonia that was incompletely treated
   with recent antibiotics.  Other DDx includes PE (CTA prelim read is
   negative), pericardial effusion (unlikely given lack of sizable
   effusion on CT scan), viral infection (does not describe viral
   prodrome).  Has not dropped his blood pressures, so does not have
   evidence of sepsis at present.
   - cover broadly with vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin given recent
   hospitalization
   - f/u sputum, urine, and blood cultures
   - discuss possible flexible bronchoscopy with IP in AM (already aware
   of pt)
   - f/u final CTA chest read
   - supportive care with albuterol, atrovent
   - check ABG to confirm he is not retaining CO2 given his tiredness
   # Metastatic melanoma:
   Currently receiving palliative XRT to hip mets.  Is also on sutent per
   primary oncologist.  Apparently, he was essentially discharged to
   hospice after his recent hospitalization and now is asking to be FULL
   code.  Family and patient are aware of advanced state of disease.
   - appreciate oncology recs
   - will likely continue sutent tomorrow pending discussion with onc
   - contact rad/onc in AM to discuss continuing XRT as inpatient
   # Sinus tachycardia:
   Patient has had baseline sinus tachycardia, likely from his underlying
   malignancy or continued chemotherapy.  He was seen by cardiology, who
   recommended nodal blocking agents.
   - check TSH (last checked in [**2137**])
   - hold metoprolol for now until it is clear he is not dropping his
   pressures with his infection
   - monitor on tele
   # Pain control:
   Patient has recently had several episodes where he becomes extremely
   sleepy after ativan/fentanyl patch/dilaudid.  On the other hand, his
   wife reports that he develops withdrawal symptoms if all narcotics are
   stopped.
   - start very low dose fentanyl patch for now
   - oral percocet for breakthrough pain
   - check LFTs in case worsening liver function is responsible for
   prolonged effect of benzodiazepine
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Loose stool:
   Has a h/o bad C diff in the past and was recently on antibiotics.
   - check C diff
   - continue PO vancomycin (will need Abx approval in AM)
   # Hyperkalemia:  recheck
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 24-28, current hct 28
   - active type and screen
   - check iron studies
   # DM:
   - currently diet controlled at home
   - gentle SSI for now
   # Likely Anxiety:
   - continue lexapro
   - will hold off on writing for ativan for now so that patient can be
   monitored closely with doses (start with minimal dose and would avoid
   giving ativan with narcotics).
   # FEN:  NPO for possible flexible bronchoscopy
   # Access:  two 18g PIVs
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, home PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted with likely post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. He has been experiencing shortness of breath, fevers, and tachycardia.
3. The shortness of breath and fevers are likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia, which was incompletely treated with recent antibiotics. Other possible diagnoses include pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, and viral infection.
4. The patient has not shown signs of sepsis, so broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
5. The patient's metastatic melanoma is being treated with palliative radiation therapy to hip mets and the medication sutent.
6. The patient has a history of bad C. difficile infection and was recently on antibiotics, leading to loose stool. C. difficile testing is recommended.
7. The patient also has hyperkalemia and anemia, which require further evaluation and management.
8. The patient has diabetes mellitus that is currently diet-controlled at home.
9. The patient is experiencing anxiety and is currently on Lexapro. Benzodiazepines will be avoided due to potential respiratory depression.
10. The patient is NPO for possible flexible bronchoscopy.
11. The patient has multiple IV lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line.

   Suctioning bright red blood, concern for pulmonary hemorrhage. Fevers
   and CT scan also suggest post-obstructive PNA.
   - Bronchoscopy today to investigate source of blood and possible
   infection

   HAP
   - f/u sputum, urine, and blood cultures
   - supportive care with albuterol, atrovent
   # Metastatic melanoma:
   Currently receiving palliative XRT to hip mets.  Is also on sutent per
   primary oncologist.  Family and patient are aware of advanced state of
   disease.
   - appreciate oncology recs
   - hold XRT due to resp status
   # s/p V Tach: Patient has metastatic involvement of myocardium which
   placed him at risk of developing arrhythmia during episode of hypoxia.
   - discontinue metoprolol due to low blood pressure
   - monitor on tele
   # Anemia: On admission thought to be secondary to chemotherapy.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Suctioning bright red blood, concern for
   pulmonary hemorrhage.
   - transfuse 2 more units, post HCT check

   a. Intubated yesterday for planned bronchoscopy - had VT during
   intubation complicated by a balloon that was ruptured.  The airway
   itself was a grade I view and not difficult to intubate.
   b. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia
   c. IP to bronch to evaluate for stent
   2) Anemia
   3) Metastatic Malignant Melenoma
   4) Tachycardia
   Addendum: Bronch performed by IP reveals bleeding from right side of
   lung as well as obstruction on left.  Will do a rigid bronch tomorrow
   to see if they can relieve.  Will transfer to the West for procedure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia after intubation. The patient experienced respiratory distress, suctioning of bright red blood, concern for pulmonary hemorrhage, and fevers. A bronchoscopy was performed to investigate the source of blood and possible infection. The patient is currently on supportive care with albuterol and atrovent.

The patient has metastatic involvement of the myocardium, placing him at risk for developing arrhythmia during episodes of hypoxia. Metoprolol was discontinued due to low blood pressure, and the patient is being monitored on tele.

The patient also has anemia, which was initially thought to be secondary to chemotherapy. However, hemolysis labs are negative, and there is concern for pulmonary hemorrhage. Two more units of blood have been transfused, and a type and screen have been ordered.

Additionally, the patient had loose stool, which has since resolved. The patient's diabetes mellitus status is being monitored, and he is receiving ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to multi-focal and obstructive pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary hemorrhage.
3. Arrhythmia due to metastatic involvement of the myocardium.
4. Anemia, possibly due to chemotherapy or other causes.
5. Metastatic malignant melanoma.
6. Tachycardia.

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia after intubation. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, which occurred following intubation. There are concerns about pulmonary hemorrhage as he is producing bright red blood during suctioning. The patient also has fevers and a CT scan suggests post-obstructive pneumonia. A bronchoscopy is planned to investigate the source of blood and possible infection.

The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics (vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin) due to recent hospitalization for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Sputum, urine, and blood cultures have been obtained for further evaluation.

The patient has metastatic involvement of the myocardium, which puts him at risk for developing arrhythmias during episodes of hypoxia. Metoprolol has been discontinued due to low blood pressure, and the patient is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient's anemia is thought to be secondary to chemotherapy, but hemolysis labs have been negative. The presence of bright red blood during suctioning raises concerns for pulmonary hemorrhage. Two more units of blood will be transfused, and a type and crossmatch will be done.

The patient's loose stool has resolved, and he will be monitored. He has diabetes mellitus and is on short-term insulin therapy.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutritional support and glycemic control measures. He"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia after intubation. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory distress, fevers, and bleeding. The patient underwent bronchoscopy to investigate the source of blood and possible infection. He is receiving antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin) and supportive care with albuterol and atrovent. The patient is also receiving palliative XRT to hip mets and is holding Sutent. His family and he are aware of his advanced state of disease.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia and respiratory distress. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which puts him at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient has active hemorrhage and received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells overnight. He also has a low blood pressure, which can contribute to hypoperfusion and further bleeding.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has metastatic involvement of the myocardium, placing him at risk for developing arrhythmias during episodes of hypoxia. He is also holding metoprolol due to low blood pressure.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia on admission, which is thought to be secondary to chemotherapy. He had an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma that has spread to various organs including the lung, liver, heart, skin, bone, and brain. He was admitted to the ICU for the management of hemoptysis and is currently intubated and ventilated. The patient's medical history includes post-obstructive pneumonia and an endobronchial lesion. He has received transfusions of blood products and has been on a combination of antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to the endobronchial lesion and post-obstructive pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the lesion cannot be managed effectively.
2. Airway Obstruction: The endobronchial lesion could potentially cause airway obstruction, leading to compromised ventilation and oxygenation.
3. Metastatic Melanoma: The presence of metastatic melanoma in multiple organs indicates a poor prognosis and may lead to further complications related to organ dysfunction.
4. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to the malignancy and immunosuppressive treatment, making him susceptible to infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection is essential.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, which can lead to hypoxemia and further respiratory distress.
6. Hypotension: Mild hypotension is present, which may require careful fluid management and consideration for vasop"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia following intubation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, bleeding, fevers, and CT scan findings consistent with post-obstructive pneumonia. A bronchoscopy has been scheduled to investigate the source of blood and possible infection.

The patient is currently receiving palliative XRT to hip mets, and chemotherapy medication ""Sutent"" has been held. The family and patient are aware of the advanced state of the disease, and it is recommended to contact the primary oncologist for further guidance.

Additionally, the patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia due to metastatic involvement of the myocardium, which increases the risk of developing arrhythmia during episodes of hypoxia. Metoprolol has been held due to low blood pressure, and continuous monitoring on tele will be implemented. An echocardiogram will be performed to rule out cardiac tamponade.

The patient also has anemia, initially thought to be secondary to chemotherapy, but now considered to be due to active hemorrhage. Hemolysis labs have been negative, and a bronchoscopic procedure is planned to treat an endobronchial lesion. Type and screen have been ordered, and the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells overnight. Serial hematocrit measurements will be monitored, and transfusions will be given as necessary,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note highlights several significant events that occurred within the 24-hour period.

The first event involves the patient undergoing a procedure where the airways were opened up by removing a tumor. After the procedure, the patient was returned to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) intubated and paralyzed. It is planned to perform a follow-up bronchoscopic examination in two weeks and consider photodynamic therapy.

The second event describes an attempt to wean the patient off the ventilator. However, the patient woke up with an elevated heart rate ranging from 140s to 150 beats per minute and an increased respiratory rate of 30-40 breaths per minute. The patient's blood gases showed a pH of 7.27, indicating acidosis. As a result, the decision was made to put the patient back on assisted controlled ventilation (AC).

The third event mentions the patient experiencing pain overnight, which was treated with Percocet administered through a nasogastric tube (NGT).

The fourth event states that the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s/40s at 2 am. In response, a 500 cc bolus was given, resulting in a response of blood pressure in the 90s/50s. Additionally, the patient's hematocrit (HCT) level was found to be 23.8%, leading to the transfusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia. He underwent intubation and a rigid bronchoscopy on [**2138-7-18**]. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing respiratory distress, fevers, and has a CT scan suggestive of post-obstructive pneumonia. He is on mechanical ventilation and is producing bloody secretions with clots. His blood pressure has been low at times, requiring fluid boluses. The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he has received 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight. His WBC count is slightly low, and his platelet count is within normal range. There are no signs of infection on Gram stain and fungal culture results are pending. The patient is receiving antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. He has metastatic involvement of the myocardium, placing him at risk for developing arrhythmias. The patient's pain and hiccups are being managed with fentanyl and versed boluses. He has a history of active hemorrhage and anemia, which may be related to chemotherapy. The patient's tumor pathology is pending, and repeat CT chest is planned if there is no clinical improvement by Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and presence of fevers, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as maintaining appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   41yo gentleman with metastatic melanoma admitted with post-obstructive
   pneumonia s/p intubation.
   # Respiratory distress: S/P intubation with complication.  Bleeding
   appears to be tapering off, but transfused overnight.  Fevers and CT
   scan also suggest post-obstructive PNA.
   - Bronchoscopy today to investigate source of blood and possible
   infection
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin given recent hospitalization for
   HAP
   - f/u sputum, urine, and blood cultures
   - supportive care with albuterol, atrovent
   # Metastatic melanoma:
   Currently receiving palliative XRT to hip mets
cannot be radiated on
   [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**].  Holding Sutent. Family and patient are aware of advanced
   state of disease.  Contact primary oncologist
   - appreciate oncology recs
   - hold XRT due to resp status
   # s/p V Tach: Patient has metastatic involvement of myocardium which
   placed him at risk of developing arrhythmia during episode of hypoxia.
   - holding metoprolol due to low blood pressure
   - monitor on tele
   - low threshold for echo to r/o tamponade
   # Anemia: On admission thought to be secondary to chemotherapy and has
   active hemorrhage. Hemolysis labs negative.
   - bronch today for endobronchial lesion treatment
   - active type and screen, transfused 1 u prbc overnight
   - follow serial HCT, transfusion as necessary especially given low BP
   # Loose stool: Resolved. Monitor.
   # DM: SSI for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia following intubation. The patient has experienced several medical complications since admission.

1. Respiratory distress: The patient had difficulty weaning off the ventilator after surgery, which could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia. A bronchoscopy has been planned to investigate the source of blood and possible infection.

2. Metastatic melanoma: The patient is receiving palliative radiation therapy to address metastases in the hip. However, the radiation cannot be administered at the moment due to the patient's respiratory status. The oncologist's recommendations will be appreciated, and it is important to contact them for further guidance.

3. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of metastatic involvement of the myocardium, which puts him at risk for developing arrhythmias, particularly during episodes of hypoxia. Metoprolol is being held due to low blood pressure, and the patient is being monitored closely with telemetry. An echocardiogram will be done to rule out cardiac tamponade.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia appears to be secondary to chemotherapy and active hemorrhage. Hemolysis labs are negative. An upcoming bronchoscopic procedure aims to treat an endobronchial lesion. The patient has received a blood transfusion and will require close monitoring of hemoglobin"

   41yo gentleman with metastatic melanoma admitted with post-obstructive
   pneumonia s/p intubation.
   # Respiratory distress: S/P intubation with complication.  Bleeding
   appears to be tapering off, but transfused overnight.  Fevers and CT
   scan also suggest post-obstructive PNA.
   - Bronchoscopy today to investigate source of blood and possible
   infection
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin given recent hospitalization for
   HAP
   - f/u sputum, urine, and blood cultures
   - supportive care with albuterol, atrovent
   # Metastatic melanoma:
   Currently receiving palliative XRT to hip mets
cannot be radiated on
   [**Hospital Ward Name 1107**].  Holding Sutent. Family and patient are aware of advanced
   state of disease.  Contact primary oncologist
   - appreciate oncology recs
   - hold XRT due to resp status
   # s/p V Tach: Patient has metastatic involvement of myocardium which
   placed him at risk of developing arrhythmia during episode of hypoxia.
   - holding metoprolol due to low blood pressure
   - monitor on tele
   - low threshold for echo to r/o tamponade
   # Anemia: On admission thought to be secondary to chemotherapy and has
   active hemorrhage. Hemolysis labs negative.
   - bronch today for endobronchial lesion treatment
   - active type and screen, transfused 1 u prbc overnight
   - follow serial HCT, transfusion as necessary especially given low BP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for post-obstructive pneumonia following intubation. The patient underwent an APC procedure and tumor removal to open up airways. He was successfully extubated but required reintubation due to respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient experienced bleeding, hypotension, and required blood transfusions. He also had fever, and a CT scan suggested post-obstructive pneumonia. Bronchoscopy was performed to investigate the source of blood and possible infection.

The patient has metastatic melanoma and is receiving palliative XRT to hip mets. He is currently holding Sutent, and the family and patient are aware of the advanced state of the disease. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he has a history of ventricular tachycardia with myocardial involvement, placing him at risk for developing arrhythmias during hypoxia. Metoprolol is being held due to low blood pressure, and the patient is being monitored closely with a low threshold for an echo to rule out tamponade.

The patient also has anemia, which is believed to be secondary to chemotherapy, along with active hemorrhage. Hemolysis labs are negative, and the patient will undergo bronchoscopic treatment for an endobronchial lesion. An active type and screen has been ordered, and the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells overnight."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma affecting multiple organs, including the lung, liver, heart, skin, bone, and brain. The patient underwent an endobronchial core procedure for hemoptysis and has post-obstructive pneumonia.

The patient experienced difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to tachypnea and tachycardia. He also required transfusion for a dropped hematocrit (Hct) level and showed improvement in blood pressure after receiving packed red blood cells (prbc) infusion.

The patient has allergies to morphine sulfate, penicillins, and adhesive tape. His last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin on 07/16/2138 at 12:01 PM, cefepime on 07/18/2138 at 12:14 AM, and vancomycin on 07/18/2138 at 07:57 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 121 bpm (104-138 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 110/62 mmHg to 152/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (19-40 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma involving the lungs, liver, heart, skin, bone, and brain. He underwent an endobronchial core procedure for hemoptysis and has post-obstructive pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Unable to extubate yesterday due to tachypnea and tachycardia.
- Transfused today for dropped Hct (hematocrit).
- Blood pressure improved with PRBC (packed red blood cell) infusion.
- Still bleeding, with ongoing suctioning of clots from the endotracheal tube.
- Unable to wean off ventilatory support due to RR > 40.
- Fever present.
- Tachycardia.
- Pain and anxiety.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to tolerate extubation and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Metastatic melanoma: The presence of metastatic melanoma involving multiple organs increases the risk of further spread and complications related to the cancer itself.
3. Anemia: The patient's low Hct levels suggest significant blood loss, which may lead to anemia and its associated complications, such as hypoxia and poor tissue perfusion.
4. Fluid status: The patient's fluid balance is a concern, with ongoing fluid administration and diuresis required to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU with post-obstructive pneumonia following intubation and rigid bronchoscopy. The patient has been receiving palliative radiation therapy to hip metastases, is unable to be radiated on due to respiratory status, and is currently holding Sutent. The family and patient are aware of the advanced state of the disease. The patient's medical history includes chemotherapy, which may have contributed to anemia. He also has a history of allergies to morphine sulfate, nausea/vomiting, penicillins, and severe rash from adhesive tape. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 111/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's lab results show leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and elevated levels of creatinine and liver enzymes. The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress, post-obstructive pneumonia, metastatic melanoma, anemia, potential ventricular tachycardia due to myocardial involvement, and pain management. The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia, monitoring culture data, transfusing packed red blood cells if hematocrit is less than 30%, holding diuretics until intravascularly repleted, daily sedation vacation trials, and contact with the primary oncologist for further recommendations. Potential complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and further arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for post-obstructive pneumonia following intubation and rigid bronchoscopy. The patient has a history of hospitalization for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and is currently receiving palliative radiation therapy to the hip metastases. He is also being held on Sutent, a medication for his melanoma. The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with fevers, and imaging suggesting post-obstructive pneumonia. He has been treated with bronchoscopic intervention. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, but he has tachycardia. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated lactate levels. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further culture data is pending. The patient's pain and hiccups have been addressed, and his loose stool has resolved. He has a history of allergies to morphine, penicillins, and adhesive tape. His code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with symptoms such as fevers, scattered ronchi bilaterally, anterior squeaks, and low oxygen saturation (94%). This could indicate worsening respiratory distress or complications related to post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to recent hospitalization for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia. He underwent intubation and rigid bronchoscopy on 07/18/2138. The patient is currently in the ICU and experiencing respiratory distress, possibly due to post-obstructive pneumonia. He is on treatment for pneumonia and has been given a plan to continue aggressive suctioning, daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and possible repeat rigid bronchoscopy. The patient's heart rate is elevated, and he has a history of metastatic involvement of the myocardium, which puts him at risk of developing arrhythmia during episodes of hypoxia. He is being closely monitored, and an echocardiogram will be done to rule out cardiac tamponade. The patient also has anemia, believed to be secondary to chemotherapy and active hemorrhage. Hemolysis labs are negative, and the patient is being kept on a low threshold for transfusion to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) level above 30. Additionally, the patient is experiencing pain and hiccups, which are being managed with fentanyl/versed boluses. Loose stool has resolved, and the patient has diabetes mellitus (DM) for which he is receiving SSI (subcutaneous insulin).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma involving the lung, liver, heart, skin, bone, and brain. The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis and underwent an endobronchial core procedure. He now presents with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and is unable to wean from the ventilator due to ongoing bleeding from the endotracheal tube.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/83 mmHg to 106/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 118 K/uL. The platelet count is within normal range at 138 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

Imaging reveals fluctuating multifocal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's medical conditions include acute anemia secondary to blood loss, hypotension (not in shock), dyspnea (shortness of breath), fever (hypothermia), melanoma (skin cancer), tachycardia (other), and pain control.

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia. He underwent intubation and a rigid bronchoscopy on [**2138-7-18**]. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, metastatic melanoma, recent ventricular tachycardia (VT), anemia, pain/hiccups, loose stools, and diabetes mellitus.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress, and there is a risk of developing further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of VT, which could be related to his metastatic involvement of the myocardium. There is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias during episodes of hypoxia.
3. Bleeding: The patient has anemia that is believed to be secondary to chemotherapy and active hemorrhage. There is a risk of further bleeding and the need for transfusion.
4. Infection: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing additional infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Metastatic spread: The patient has metastatic melanoma, which can progress and cause further complications, such as bone metastases or liver metastases.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia and subsequently intubated and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing respiratory distress. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 113/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine sulfate, penicillins, and adhesive tape. He has received multiple antibiotics since admission, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient is receiving infusions of midazolam and fentanyl for sedation. He also has ongoing issues with pain, hiccups, anemia, and metastatic melanoma. The patient's family has discussed the possibility of terminal extubation, but the patient wishes to continue fighting. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's current respiratory distress may worsen due to the underlying post-obstructive pneumonia and potential complications associated with prolonged intubation.
2. Arrhythmias: Given the patient's metastatic involvement of the myocardium, he is at risk for developing arrhythmias, particularly during episodes of hypoxia.
3. Infection: Despite receiving multiple antibiotics, the patient may still be at risk for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma involving multiple organs including the lungs, liver, heart, skin, bone, and brain. The patient has undergone an endobronchial core for hemoptysis and has post-obstructive pneumonia. 

The patient continues to have blood suctioned from the endotracheal tube (ETT) and is unable to be weaned from the ventilator, but efforts are being made to try. The patient also experienced a small bleed in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Hospital1, but minimal intervention was required.

The assessment and plan include the following:

- Respiratory: Continue antibiotics, decrease PEEP and FiO2 based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results. Start steroid taper. Continue nebulizers. Maintain central venous pressure (CVP) as low as possible. Discuss tracheostomy/PEG vs. biPAP if minute ventilation and oxygenation can be managed.
- Hematology: Keep hematocrit (Hct) level at 25.
- Inputs/Outputs: Keep CVP at 4 with blood/lasix. The patient's wife refuses Foley catheter due to a prior traumatic experience. Bladder scan if needed.
- Infection: Continue antimicrobials for 10 days. History of Clostridium difficile infection, follow closely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma involving multiple organs including the lung, liver, heart, skin, bone, and brain. He underwent an endobronchial core for hemoptysis and has post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient continues to have blood suctioned from his endotracheal tube and is unable to be weaned from the ventilator. He was bronchoscoped yesterday and a small bleeder was identified but no intervention was required.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has not been able to be weaned off. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung infection due to his immunocompromised state from the metastatic melanoma.

2. Metastatic melanoma progression: The patient's melanoma has spread to multiple organs, indicating advanced-stage disease. There is a possibility of further progression of the disease leading to additional organ involvement and potential complications.

3. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient has ongoing bleeding from the endotracheal tube, which could indicate ongoing pulmonary hemorrhage. This could lead to hypoxemia and respiratory distress.

4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and may require transfusion support.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension. This"

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress and has not tolerated attempts to wean PEEP or FiO2. He is agitated, tachypneic, and tachycardic, requiring bolus sedation. Antibiotics have been continued, and there is a plan to discuss the possibility of tracheostomy (Trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) if extubation fails. Tube feeds are being continued, but held after morning nutrition. The patient has metastatic involvement of the myocardium, putting him at risk of arrhythmia during episodes of hypoxia. Metoprolol is being held due to low blood pressure, and an echocardiogram will be performed to rule out cardiac tamponade. The patient has anemia, and blood transfusions are planned. Pain and hiccups are being managed with fentanyl/versed boluses and prn oxycodone. Loose stool has resolved, and diabetes mellitus is being monitored. The patient's condition requires ongoing discussion with the family regarding potential tracheostomy, PEG, and melanoma treatment options."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia. He underwent intubation and a rigid bronchoscopy on [**2138-7-18**]. Since then, he has been experiencing respiratory distress, which has not tolerated attempts to wean PEEP or FiO2. He has been agitated, tachypneic, and tachycardic. The patient is currently on ventilatory support with an endotracheal tube and is receiving aggressive care.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is a significant concern. Despite attempts to wean PEEP and FiO2, he has not tolerated these changes well. This indicates a potential issue with his lung function or possibly an underlying infection.
2. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient has metastatic melanoma, which indicates advanced stage cancer. It is important to consider the impact of cancer on his overall health and prognosis.
3. Myocardial Metastasis: The patient has metastatic involvement of the myocardium, placing him at risk for developing arrhythmias during episodes of hypoxia. This requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. This may contribute to his overall weakness and lack of oxygenation.
5. Pain/Hiccups: The patient is experiencing pain and h"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who was admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia and underwent intubation and rigid bronchoscopy on [**2138-7-18**]. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing respiratory distress, possibly due to the underlying metastatic disease involving the myocardium. The patient has been aggressively treated with various medications, including sedation, pain management, and antibiotics. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight increase in heart rate and low blood pressure. The patient's blood work shows some abnormalities, such as elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and previous history of post-obstructive pneumonia put him at risk for further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has metastatic involvement of the myocardium, which increases the risk of arrhythmias, particularly during episodes of hypoxia. Close monitoring and prompt intervention may be necessary to prevent or manage cardiac events.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged PTT suggest a potential coagulopathy. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and appropriate management with blood products or other coagulation factors may be required.
4. Infection: Given the patient's immun"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-inch old male who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine sulfate, nausea/vomiting, penicillins, and severe rash from adhesive tape. The patient's medical history includes being overweight, anxiety disorder, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

24-hour events:
- The patient did not tolerate any changes in ventilator settings and required sedation.
- PEEP was increased to 10 cmH2O and FIO2 to 60% due to low oxygenation.
- Lasix was administered IV for increased oxygen requirement, but there was no change in suction output.
- Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were discussed.

Infusions:
- Midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour
- Fentanyl at 150 mcg/hour
- Other ICU medications include lansoprazole, furosemide, and fentanyl.

Fluid Balance:
The patient has received a total of 1,413 mL of fluids since midnight, with 546 mL of intake and 165 mL of output through the NG tube. The total output was 1,710 mL, including 480 mL of urine output.

Vital Signs:
- Temperature: 37.1 C (98.7 F)

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old man with metastatic melanoma presenting with respiratory failure due to hemoptysis and poor lung compliance from metastases. He has a history of allergies to morphine, penicillins, and adhesive tape. He was previously hospitalized and had limited functional status at home. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

24-hour events:
The patient received antibiotics (levofloxacin, cefipime, and vancomycin) within the past 24 hours. He has been on continuous infusions of midazolam and fentanyl. Other medications include furosemide.

Review of systems:
The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/61 to 136/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is in sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,413 mL and output of 1,710 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 297 mL. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for post-obstructive pneumonia, following intubation and rigid bronchoscopy on [**2138-7-18**]. The patient has not tolerated attempts to wean PEEP or FiO2 and is experiencing respiratory distress. He is agitated and has periods of tachypnea and tachycardia, so bolus sedation is being used. Antibiotics are continued, and steroids are being weaned to 40 IV q12. The patient will undergo bronchial therapy today and tube feeds will be held after midnight. The oncology team is following up, but no melanoma treatment options remain. An ongoing discussion with the family is appreciated, and a meeting with all medical teams involved will be set up.

The patient has metastatic involvement of the myocardium, which places him at risk for developing arrhythmia during episodes of hypoxia. Metoprolol is being held due to low blood pressure, and the patient is being monitored on tele. A low threshold for an echo will be maintained to rule out tamponade. The patient has anemia, for which a type and screen has been ordered. Pain and hiccups are also present, and fentanyl/versed boluses are being given along with prn oxycodone. Palliative care consultation for pain management is planned.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of melanoma, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and acute anemia due to blood loss. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and is planned for further treatment including radiation therapy. He has multiple medical complications such as hypotension, fever, tachycardia, pain, and anxiety. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 117/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated glucose levels. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 set at 50%, and PEEP at 10 cmH2O. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates normal oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bronchial area and distended abdomen. The patient's pain and anxiety are being managed with fentanyl and midazolam infusions. Further discussions regarding tracheostomy/PEG tube placement and palliative care are ongoing with the family. The patient's code status remains as full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Monitoring and adjusting ventilator settings will be crucial to maintain adequate oxygenation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old man with metastatic melanoma who is experiencing respiratory failure due to an endobronchial hemorrhage. He underwent a bronchoscopy and will be taken to the operating room (OR) for cautery to prevent further bleeding. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance of 0.026 L/cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/58 mmHg to 160/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 4 mmHg, with a total input of 2,441 mL and output of 1,650 mL since midnight. His blood products transfused amount to 350 mL. The patient's laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and liver function tests, except for slightly elevated levels of lactate and lactate dehydrogenase. His electrolytes are within normal limits, with a slightly low magnesium level. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted"

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia, who underwent intubation and rigid bronchoscopy. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and has not tolerated attempts to wean PEEP or FiO2. He has been given bolus sedation due to periods of agitation, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Antibiotics have been continued.

The patient's medical history includes metastatic melanoma, for which no further treatment options remain. The family is being assisted in discussing ongoing care, and a meeting will be set up with all medical teams involved.

The patient also has a history of ventricular tachycardia, with metastatic involvement of the myocardium placing him at risk of developing arrhythmias during episodes of hypoxia. Metoprolol is being held due to low blood pressure, and the patient is being monitored on tele. A low threshold for an echo is being maintained to rule out tamponade.

Additionally, the patient has anemia, for which a type and screen has been ordered. Pain and hiccups have been present, and fentanyl/versed boluses and prn oxycodone have been administered. Palliative care consultations are being made for pain management, and anesthesia recommendations will be followed.

The patient previously experienced loose stool but it has since resolved. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis have been provided."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to post-obstructive pneumonia and hemoptysis caused by endobronchial lesions from metastatic melanoma. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy but experienced bleeding and required argon treatment. The argon treatment was unsuccessful, and the patient is scheduled for an interventional radiology (IR) procedure called embolization to control the bleeding. The patient is currently on propofol, OG tube and ET tube in good position, and started with tube feeds but stopped at midnight. 

The patient has allergies to morphine sulfate, penicillins, adhesive tape, and nausea/vomiting. The last doses of antibiotics were cefepime at 01:03 PM, levofloxacin at 01:26 PM, and vancomycin at 08:00 PM. The patient is receiving midazolam (versed) and fentanyl infusions. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 145/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has hemoptysis, which indicates bleeding in the respiratory system. The patient underwent two interventional procedures for right lower lobe (RLL) bleeder, including argon and cauterization, but continued to bleed. As a result, the patient requires right lower lobe bronchial artery embolization today. 

The patient also has metastatic melanoma, and it would be beneficial to have oncology input. Additionally, the patient is experiencing pain, and a thoracic nerve block may be necessary for pain relief. This has been discussed with palliative care and the pain service.

Furthermore, the patient is constipated and has been started on a bowel regimen. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with ongoing respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV) due to apnea on sedation. The plan is to reattempt weaning of the ventilator after the RLL bronchial artery embolization. A tracheostomy/PEG tube may be required in the future.

Other ongoing issues include anxiety, acute and chronic pain, anxiety, fever, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, and they have a history of melanoma. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for the interventional radiology (IR) procedure. Glycemic control is being monitored,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted with post-obstructive pneumonia. He underwent intubation and rigid bronchoscopy on [**2138-7-18**]. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- He had IR embolization of the right lower lobe bronchial artery and blood suctioning upon return.
- His ventilator settings were decreased throughout the day and he tolerated them well. The plan for extubation is in the morning.
- His pain management plan was changed back to versed/fentanyl gtt. He was started on a fentanyl patch at 200 mcg/hr and decreasing versed gtt.
- The patient has allergies to morphine sulfate, nausea/vomiting, penicillins, and adhesive tape (topical).
- He received antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefipime.
- He is currently on midazolam (versed) and fentanyl infusions.
- Other ICU medications include midazolam (versed), lansoprazole (prevacid), and fentanyl.
- The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue.
- The patient has an OG/NG tube in place.
- His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 139/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- His hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are noted.
- The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, anxious appearance, normocephalic head, endotracheal tube, OG tube, hyperdynamic PMI, symmetric breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and muscle wasting.
- Laboratory results show normal WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, TCO2, glucose, and other electrolyte levels.
- The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, metastatic melanoma, s/p VTach, anemia, pain management, constipation, and DM.
- The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's post-obstructive pneumonia and the need for intubation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. The plan for extubation today suggests an improvement in his respiratory status, but there is still a possibility of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or airway obstruction.
2. Metastatic melanoma: The patient has metastatic melanoma, which may lead to further complications related to cancer progression, such as spread to other organs or worsening of respiratory symptoms.
3. Anemia: The patient may have anemia due to hemoptysis. Transfusion might be required, and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary.
4. Pain management: The patient requires pain management due to metastatic melanoma. Improper pain control can lead to discomfort and complications related to agitation or poor cooperation during medical procedures.
5. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation, which can be managed with a standing bowel regimen.
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and glycemic control should be maintained to prevent complications related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers: Prophylaxis is in place for DVT and stress ulcers, but these conditions still pose potential complications if not effectively prevented.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Looks great on PSV 5/5, but still having bloody
   secretions.  Unclear if he will be able to tolerate extubation, but
   confirmed that he
   wants to be reintubated.  Will go ahead with extubation.
   CXR with LLL collapse, but likely intermittent no specific therapy for
   it besides chest PT after extubation.
   Pain:  Currently well controlled.   Not complaining of pain.
   [**Month (only) 11**] need PIC Line long term so will move towards placement.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 40-year-old man with metastatic melanoma who is experiencing respiratory failure. He underwent bronchial artery embolization due to massive hemoptysis but continues to have bloody secretions. The patient's allergies include morphine sulfate, penicillins, and adhesive tape, which cause nausea, vomiting, hives, and a severe rash. 

The patient has been receiving various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, lansoprazole, and others. His medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged except for the current condition. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/80 to 161/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 8 mmHg and fluid balance within normal limits.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 48, and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of melanoma, who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient had been on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. However, he still experiences increased work of breathing. The patient decided to be DNR/DNI and the oncologist agreed with the plan. Pain management is being addressed, with a recommendation for an epidural or intrathecal catheter. Antibiotics have been discontinued, and steroids have been decreased. The patient's CVL remains in place as he declined PIV. There is a concern regarding the patient's right distal pulse, which is not palpable but faintly detected on color doppler. The patient's wife was informed of the options if arterial occlusion occurred, and she requested warm pads.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. Although he was successfully extubated, he still has increased work of breathing, indicating a potential risk for recurrent respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The patient has received multiple courses of antibiotics, suggesting a risk of infection. Discontinuation of antibiotics may increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections.

3. Thrombosis: The presence of CVL and arterial lines increases the risk of thrombosis, particularly in the context of immobilization and critical illness.

4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has fluctuated throughout the course"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has undergone intubation and rigid bronchoscopy. He is currently extubated but still experiencing increased work of breathing (WOB). The patient's clinical status has been worsening, with tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation. The priority is pain control, and the patient will continue to receive fentanyl and ativan infusions. Other medications will be discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening WOB and decreased oxygen saturation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory function and consideration of re-intubation may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, there is a possibility of developing sepsis due to the ongoing infection. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is essential.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and malignancy are risk factors for DVT. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent clot formation.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of stress ulcers due to critical illness and intubation. Continuing acid suppression therapy is important to prevent gastric ulcers.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old man with metastatic melanoma who was extubated yesterday but unable to clear secretions. He decided against reintubation and is currently on fentanyl and ativan drips. The patient has allergies to morphine sulfate, nausea/vomiting, penicillins, and adhesive tape. He received antibiotics including levofloxacin, cefipime, and vancomycin within the past 24 hours. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), blood pressure of 98/53 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 82%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, with a fluid balance of 657 mL total in and 607 mL total out, resulting in a negative balance of 1,623 mL. The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen and is on standby ventilation mode with an FiO2 of 95% and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 66. Physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds on the left side, and no other assessments were performed due to the patient's condition. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 145 K/u"
