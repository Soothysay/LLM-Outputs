","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, worsening renal function, and altered mental status. The patient was intubated for hypoventilation and received 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a low hematocrit level. He is currently on antibiotics and requires norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure.

24-hour events include the patient being sedated and unable to provide history, confusion, and delirium. His vital signs show bradycardia, hypotension, and normal respiratory rate. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O.

Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments. Laboratory results show a decreased hemoglobin concentration and total carbon dioxide level. Fluid analysis reveals more than 50 white blood cells. Imaging shows a right parietal infarct on the CT head. Microbiology samples are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's hypotension is suspected to be caused by urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiomyopathy, and chronotropic insufficiency. He is receiving blood transfusions, antibiotics, and continuous levophed infusion. Dobutamine has been added to the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, worsening renal function, and altered mental status. He was admitted for a large left gastrointestinal bleed and received 2 units of packed red blood cells. The patient has been bradycardic and hypotensive, requiring norepinephrine. He is currently intubated, sedated, and unresponsive. The patient has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, aortic valve stenosis, and a cerebrovascular accident. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to hypoventilation, which necessitated intubation. Continuous ventilator support is required, and weaning will be attempted as tolerated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be attributed to several factors such as gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiomyopathy, or chronotropic insufficiency. Levophed has been initiated to maintain blood pressure, and dobutamine has been added to assess for possible improvement in cardiac function.
3. Transudative Effusions: The presence of large right-sided pleural effusion and peripheral edema suggests the possibility of congestive heart failure (CHF). Diuretic therapy may be necessary to manage these effusions.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function requires"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, worsening renal function, and mental status changes. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and various comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. He has significant edema in his arms and legs, and imaging reveals a right parietal infarct and large right pleural effusion. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires ongoing supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the presence of infection indicators (elevated WBC count) and possible UTI, GIB, or other sources of infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The large right pleural effusion may increase the risk of a pulmonary embolism, especially considering the patient's immobilization and other risk factors.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure, bradycardia, and history of cardiomyopathy suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient's current renal dysfunction may worsen due to factors such as hypotension, medication side effects, or sepsis.
5. Stroke: The CT head showing a right par"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleed, and now presents with shock and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and has been receiving various treatments including invasive ventilation, arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and medications such as norepinephrine, dobutamine, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing mixed septic and cardiogenic shock. The primary contributing factors include suspect urinary tract infection (UTI), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), cardiomyopathy, and chronotropic insufficiency. The patient's condition may worsen if not properly managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy, blood and dobutamine transfusions, and careful monitoring of hemodynamics.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is in the setting of shock, and there is a concern for laryngeal edema on laryngoscope. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to large effusions and volume overload. Careful attention will be needed during extubation.

3. Transudative Effusions: These effusions are likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF) and will require diuresis or repeat paracentesis.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure will need to be closely monitored, and renal dose medications should be administered accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - patient arrived with a respiratory acidosis,
   likely secondary to altered mental status in the setting of large right
   sided pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Oxygenating well on
   minimal vent settings, which can likely be weaned to PS by morning.
   Patient likely just needs backup rate and peep. Consider retap pleural
   effusion on this admission.
   - wean vent settings to CPAP/PS overnight
   - attempt bolus sedation
   - chlorhex mouthwash, ppi, HOB>30 degrees, oral care
   - consider tap of pleural eff, as compressive atelectasis may be
   barrier to extubation.
   .
   #. Hypotension - differential is still broad at this time. Main
   concerns are hemorrhagic, cardiogenic and septic shock. Hemorrhagic
   shock from a GIB are highly unlikely at this time, as hct has been
   stable and although he did have a moderate amount of BRBPR, he it was
   not brisk and did not continue. GI has a low suspicion that his
   symptoms are secondary to hemorrhage from a GI source. Cardiogenic
   shock is a possibility, the patient has a poor cardiac substrate to
   begin with. That being said, CE's are not elevated over his baseline
   and are in the setting of renal failure, with no acute ischemic changes
   on EKG. It may be that we are seeing cardiac stunning in the setting of
   sepsis, exacerbated by afib with slow ventricular response. PE is also
   a possibility, and on exam there is evidence of asymmetric lower
   extremity edema. Septic shock, of course, is at the top of the
   differential, however, we don't have an obvious source at this time
   aside from a dirty UA. Other sources could be CAP, empyema, aspiration
   pna or GI source, however CT torso (albeit non-con) was unrevealing for
   GI pathology. LFT's were wnl. It's best at this time to treat for
   combination septic and cardiogenic physiologies.
   - Favor pressors over aggressive volume repletion, however will give an
   additional liter of NS and continue with blood as needed to support
   hct>30
   - Dobutamine to titrate to HR>70 and MAP>60 while titrating down
   levophed
   - Empiric coverage with vanco/zosyn (vanco dosing by level)
   - F/U LENI's
   - Maintain Hct>30
   - F/U TEE
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - will need to resite fem line today - at that point can check central
   venous sat.  However a family meeting should take place prior to
   procedure to determine aggressiveness of care.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - baseline 2.0-2.5. Likely secondary
   to poor forward flow from poor cardiac function. Possible that dobuta
   will increase renal perfusion by maximizing EF. Given the patient's
   multiple co-morbidities and age, HD is unlikely to improve his
   mortality and increase his morbidity.
   - call renal in AM, need recs for phos binder
   - F/U urine cx
   - continue calcitriol
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status - could be any combination of the above
   factors. Currently intubated and sedated. Suffered a recent parietal
   stroke.
   .
   #. DM2 - RISS and QID fingersticks.
   .
   #. Cards
       Rhythm: afib not on coumadin given GIB history, monitor on
   telemetry. Holding rate control agents. Also slow ventricular response,
   which is likely compromising forward flow given global hypokinesis and
   EF 20%, was started on dobutamine.
       Pump: Has large pleural effusion which has been tapped in past,
   transudative. Also has evidence of upper extremity and asymmetric lower
   extremity edema, and elevated JVP, which suggests total body volume
   overload, vs. third spacing. Requiring pressor support now, but this
   may be a function of poor forward flow. Holding diuretics, levophed and
   dobuta to increase ionotropy and EF.
       Coronaries: No evidence of active ischemia at this time. Hct stable
   at 29.6. CE's cycling, however elevated in setting of renal failure,
   they are within his baseline.
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - in the setting of renal failure. borderline at this
   time and trending down.  Pt was given a dose of kayexalate now awaiting
   BM.
   .
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: boots

   # Code: presumed full for now
 Will need family meeting to clarify
   goals as Pts daughter seemed confused as to what constitutes artificial
   means..

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations, recent admission for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) stage 4, and hypotension, bradycardia, and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient arrived with respiratory acidosis, likely secondary to altered mental status in the setting of a large right-sided pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Oxygenation is good on minimal vent settings, which can likely be weaned to PSV by morning. Consider tapping the pleural effusion on this admission.
2. Hypotension - The differential includes hemorrhagic, cardiogenic, and septic shock. Hemorrhagic shock from GIB is highly unlikely at this time, as hematocrit (Hct) has been stable and there was no brisk blood loss. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility due to the patient's poor cardiac substrate. Septic shock is also possible, but no obvious source has been identified.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - The patient's baseline renal function is impaired, likely secondary to poor forward flow from poor cardiac function. Dobutamine may increase"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - patient arrived with a respiratory acidosis,
   likely secondary to altered mental status in the setting of large right
   sided pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Oxygenating well on
   minimal vent settings, which can likely be weaned to PS by morning.
   Patient likely just needs backup rate and peep. Consider retap pleural
   effusion on this admission.
   - wean vent settings to CPAP/PS overnight
   - attempt bolus sedation
   - chlorhex mouthwash, ppi, HOB>30 degrees, oral care
   - consider tap of pleural eff, as compressive atelectasis may be
   barrier to extubation.
   .
   #. Hypotension - differential is still broad at this time. Main
   concerns are hemorrhagic, cardiogenic and septic shock. Hemorrhagic
   shock from a GIB are highly unlikely at this time, as hct has been
   stable and although he did have a moderate amount of BRBPR, he it was
   not brisk and did not continue. GI has a low suspicion that his
   symptoms are secondary to hemorrhage from a GI source. Cardiogenic
   shock is a possibility, the patient has a poor cardiac substrate to
   begin with. That being said, CE's are not elevated over his baseline
   and are in the setting of renal failure, with no acute ischemic changes
   on EKG. It may be that we are seeing cardiac stunning in the setting of
   sepsis, exacerbated by afib with slow ventricular response. PE is also
   a possibility, and on exam there is evidence of asymmetric lower
   extremity edema. Septic shock, of course, is at the top of the
   differential, however, we don't have an obvious source at this time
   aside from a dirty UA. Other sources could be CAP, empyema, aspiration
   pna or GI source, however CT torso (albeit non-con) was unrevealing for
   GI pathology. LFT's were wnl. It's best at this time to treat for
   combination septic and cardiogenic physiologies.
   - Favor pressors over aggressive volume repletion, however will give an
   additional liter of NS and continue with blood as needed to support
   hct>30
   - Dobutamine to titrate to HR>70 and MAP>60 while titrating down
   levophed
   - Empiric coverage with vanco/zosyn (vanco dosing by level)
   - F/U LENI's
   - Maintain Hct>30
   - F/U TEE
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - will need to resite fem line today - at that point can check central
   venous sat.  However a family meeting should take place prior to
   procedure to determine aggressiveness of care.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - baseline 2.0-2.5. Likely secondary
   to poor forward flow from poor cardiac function. Possible that dobuta
   will increase renal perfusion by maximizing EF. Given the patient's
   multiple co-morbidities and age, HD is unlikely to improve his
   mortality and increase his morbidity.
   - call renal in AM, need recs for phos binder
   - F/U urine cx
   - continue calcitriol
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status - could be any combination of the above
   factors. Currently intubated and sedated. Suffered a recent parietal
   stroke.
   .
   #. DM2 - RISS and QID fingersticks.
   .
   #. Cards
       Rhythm: afib not on coumadin given GIB history, monitor on
   telemetry. Holding rate control agents. Also slow ventricular response,
   which is likely compromising forward flow given global hypokinesis and
   EF 20%, was started on dobutamine.
       Pump: Has large pleural effusion which has been tapped in past,
   transudative. Also has evidence of upper extremity and asymmetric lower
   extremity edema, and elevated JVP, which suggests total body volume
   overload, vs. third spacing. Requiring pressor support now, but this
   may be a function of poor forward flow. Holding diuretics, levophed and
   dobuta to increase ionotropy and EF.
       Coronaries: No evidence of active ischemia at this time. Hct stable
   at 29.6. CE's cycling, however elevated in setting of renal failure,
   they are within his baseline.
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - in the setting of renal failure. borderline at this
   time and trending down.  Pt was given a dose of kayexalate now awaiting
   BM.
   .
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, NPO
   .

 Will need family meeting to clarify

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), recently admitted for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) stage 4, who was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening renal function. The patient arrived hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with evidence of respiratory acidosis likely secondary to altered mental status in the setting of a large right-sided pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - the patient is already experiencing respiratory acidosis and altered mental status, which can lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension - the patient has a broad differential for hypotension, including hemorrhagic, cardiogenic, and septic shock. This requires immediate attention and treatment.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - the patient's baseline renal function is compromised due to poor forward flow from poor cardiac function. It is crucial to monitor and manage the patient's renal function closely.
4. Altered Mental Status - the patient's altered mental status could be attributed to multiple factors including hypotension, sepsis, or a recent parietal"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 HYPOTHERMIA
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - patient arrived with a respiratory acidosis,
   likely secondary to altered mental status in the setting of large right
   sided pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Oxygenating well on
   minimal vent settings, which can likely be weaned to PS by morning.
   Patient likely just needs backup rate and peep. Consider retap pleural
   effusion on this admission.
   - wean vent settings to CPAP/PS overnight
   - attempt bolus sedation
   - chlorhex mouthwash, ppi, HOB>30 degrees, oral care
   - consider tap of pleural eff, as compressive atelectasis may be
   barrier to extubation.
   .
   #. Hypotension - differential is still broad at this time. Main
   concerns are hemorrhagic, cardiogenic and septic shock. Hemorrhagic
   shock from a GIB are highly unlikely at this time, as hct has been
   stable and although he did have a moderate amount of BRBPR, he it was
   not brisk and did not continue. GI has a low suspicion that his
   symptoms are secondary to hemorrhage from a GI source. Cardiogenic
   shock is a possibility, the patient has a poor cardiac substrate to
   begin with. That being said, CE's are not elevated over his baseline
   and are in the setting of renal failure, with no acute ischemic changes
   on EKG. It may be that we are seeing cardiac stunning in the setting of
   sepsis, exacerbated by afib with slow ventricular response. PE is also
   a possibility, and on exam there is evidence of asymmetric lower
   extremity edema. Septic shock, of course, is at the top of the
   differential, however, we don't have an obvious source at this time
   aside from a dirty UA. Other sources could be CAP, empyema, aspiration
   pna or GI source, however CT torso (albeit non-con) was unrevealing for
   GI pathology. LFT's were wnl. It's best at this time to treat for
   combination septic and cardiogenic physiologies.
   - Favor pressors over aggressive volume repletion, however will give an
   additional liter of NS and continue with blood as needed to support
   hct>30
   - Dobutamine to titrate to HR>70 and MAP>60 while titrating down
   levophed
   - Empiric coverage with vanco/zosyn (vanco dosing by level)
   - F/U LENI's
   - Maintain Hct>30
   - F/U TEE
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - will need to resite fem line today - at that point can check central
   venous sat.  However a family meeting should take place prior to
   procedure to determine aggressiveness of care.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - baseline 2.0-2.5. Likely secondary
   to poor forward flow from poor cardiac function. Possible that dobuta
   will increase renal perfusion by maximizing EF. Given the patient's
   multiple co-morbidities and age, HD is unlikely to improve his
   mortality and increase his morbidity.
   - call renal in AM, need recs for phos binder
   - F/U urine cx
   - continue calcitriol
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status - could be any combination of the above
   factors. Currently intubated and sedated. Suffered a recent parietal
   stroke.

   #. DM2 - RISS and QID fingersticks.

       Rhythm: afib not on coumadin given GIB history, monitor on
   telemetry. Holding rate control agents. Also slow ventricular response,

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 0-10mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
   The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV
   diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild
   global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-2**], the left
   ventricular systolic function is better. The severity of tricuspid

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.

   #. Dyspnea
   - patient is currently on CPAP/PSV of [**4-20**]
   - continue sedations PRN if pt is pulling at or biting tube
   - consider further attempts to wean the patient off of the ventilator

   - pt did have a slight drop in Hct since yesterday, though, so will
   need to keep monitoring differential is still broad at this time.
   - PE is also less likely because lower extremity ultrasounds were WNL.

       Rhythm: afib not on coumadin given GIB history, monitor on
   telemetry. Holding rate control agents. Also slow ventricular response,
   which is likely compromising forward flow given global hypokinesis and
   EF 20%, was started on dobutamine.
       Pump: Has large pleural effusion which has been tapped in past,
   transudative. Also has evidence of upper extremity and asymmetric lower
   extremity edema, and elevated JVP, which suggests total body volume
   overload, vs. third spacing. Requiring pressor support now, but this
   may be a function of poor forward flow. Holding diuretics, levophed and
   dobuta to increase ionotropy and EF.
       Coronaries: No evidence of active ischemia at this time. Hct stable

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations, who was admitted for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding. He has atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), chronic renal insufficiency (stage 4), and was transferred from rehabilitation for altered mental status and worsening renal function. On admission, he was hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV and will continue to be monitored. Further attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator will be considered.
2. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is still unclear. It is likely not hemorrhagic shock as the patient's hematocrit levels are stable. Other potential causes include septic shock or cardiogenic shock due to poor forward flow caused by global hypokinesis and low ejection fraction. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient will continue to be treated empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Norepinephrine will be titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2-2.5, and it has increased to 4.5. This is likely secondary to"

   Echo ([**6-5**])The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild
   global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). Transmitral
   Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
   (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild
   global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-2**], the left
   ventricular systolic function is better. The severity of tricuspid
   regurgitation and detected pulmonary artery systolic hypertension have
   increased. . The echocardiographic findings are consistent with
   restrictive cardiomyopathy (? Amyloid, Fabry's).
   Renal U/S ([**6-5**])
 No hydronephrosis, small amount of ascites, small
   right pleural effusions.
   Bilateral Lower Extremity U/S ([**6-5**]) - No evidence of deep vein
   thrombosis in either leg.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.
   .
   #. Dyspnea
   - patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with PEEP of 0 and PS of 5
   - continue sedation if pt is pulling at or biting tube
   - consider further attempts to wean the patient off of the ventilator
   should change pt
s femoral line to a central line before attempting to
   extubated patient, however
   .
   #. Hypotension
   - still no clear etiology
   - likely that this is not hemorrhagic shock
 GI has a low suspicion
   and the patient
s Hct
s are overall stable
   - pt did have a slight drop in Hct since yesterday, though, so will
   need to keep monitoring.
   - PE is also less likely because lower extremity ultrasounds were WNL.
   - blood and urine cx still pending - will treat empirically with
   vanc/zosyn as per yesterday
 need to renally dose vanc based off of
   vanc level
   - pt also has severe diastolic dysfunction so need to be careful with
   fluids
   - pt is off of dobutamine, getting norepi
   - will continue to hold all antihypertensives
   - need to resite the patient
s femoral line
 should be changed to a
   central line prior to extubating the patient
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - likely secondary to poor renal perfusion
   - follow-up renal consult
   .
   #. DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), recent admission for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (afib), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) stage 4, and altered mental status. The patient was transferred from rehab and found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic. 

The patient is currently on continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation (CPAP/PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 and pressure support (PS) of 5. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 109/56 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 35 mmHg, total fluid intake of 3,341 mL, and total fluid output of 2,808 mL. The patient is receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.
   .
   #. Dyspnea
   - patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with PEEP of 0 and PS of 5
   - continue sedation if pt is pulling at or biting tube
   - consider further attempts to wean the patient off of the ventilator
   should change pt
s femoral line to a central line before attempting to
   extubated patient, however
   .
   #. Hypotension
   - still no clear etiology
   - likely that this is not hemorrhagic shock
 GI has a low suspicion
   and the patient
s Hct
s are overall stable
   - pt did have a slight drop in Hct since yesterday, though, so will
   need to keep monitoring.
   - PE is also less likely because lower extremity ultrasounds were WNL.
   - blood and urine cx still pending - will treat empirically with
   vanc/zosyn as per yesterday
 need to renally dose vanc based off of
   vanc level
   - pt also has severe diastolic dysfunction so need to be careful with
   fluids
   - pt is off of dobutamine, getting norepi
   - will continue to hold all antihypertensives
   - need to resite the patient
s femoral line
 should be changed to a
   central line prior to extubating the patient
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - likely secondary to poor renal perfusion
   - follow-up renal consult
   .
   #. DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), recently admitted for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) stage 4, who was transferred from rehabilitation for altered mental status and worsening renal function.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory support: The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation (CPAP/PSV) with a peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 and positive pressure (PS) of 5. Sedation will be continued if the patient pulls at or bites the tube. Further attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator should be considered after changing the patient's femoral line to a central line.
- Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is still without a clear etiology. Hemorrhagic shock is less likely as there is no evidence of blood loss and the patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also less likely since the lower extremity ultrasounds were normal. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin (Vanco) and piperacillin/t"

 HYPOTHERMIA
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - patient arrived with a respiratory acidosis,
   likely secondary to altered mental status in the setting of large right
   sided pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Oxygenating well on
   minimal vent settings, which can likely be weaned to PS by morning.
   Patient likely just needs backup rate and peep. Consider retap pleural
   effusion on this admission.
   - wean vent settings to CPAP/PS overnight
   - attempt bolus sedation
   - chlorhex mouthwash, ppi, HOB>30 degrees, oral care
   - consider tap of pleural eff, as compressive atelectasis may be
   barrier to extubation.
   .
   #. Hypotension - differential is still broad at this time. Main
   concerns are hemorrhagic, cardiogenic and septic shock. Hemorrhagic
   shock from a GIB are highly unlikely at this time, as hct has been
   stable and although he did have a moderate amount of BRBPR, he it was
   not brisk and did not continue. GI has a low suspicion that his
   symptoms are secondary to hemorrhage from a GI source. Cardiogenic
   shock is a possibility, the patient has a poor cardiac substrate to
   begin with. That being said, CE's are not elevated over his baseline
   and are in the setting of renal failure, with no acute ischemic changes
   on EKG. It may be that we are seeing cardiac stunning in the setting of
   sepsis, exacerbated by afib with slow ventricular response. PE is also
   a possibility, and on exam there is evidence of asymmetric lower
   extremity edema. Septic shock, of course, is at the top of the
   differential, however, we don't have an obvious source at this time
   aside from a dirty UA. Other sources could be CAP, empyema, aspiration
   pna or GI source, however CT torso (albeit non-con) was unrevealing for
   GI pathology. LFT's were wnl. It's best at this time to treat for
   combination septic and cardiogenic physiologies.
   - Favor pressors over aggressive volume repletion, however will give an
   additional liter of NS and continue with blood as needed to support
   hct>30
   - Dobutamine to titrate to HR>70 and MAP>60 while titrating down
   levophed
   - Empiric coverage with vanco/zosyn (vanco dosing by level)
   - F/U LENI's
   - Maintain Hct>30
   - F/U TEE
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - will need to resite fem line today - at that point can check central
   venous sat.  However a family meeting should take place prior to
   procedure to determine aggressiveness of care.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - baseline 2.0-2.5. Likely secondary
   to poor forward flow from poor cardiac function. Possible that dobuta
   will increase renal perfusion by maximizing EF. Given the patient's
   multiple co-morbidities and age, HD is unlikely to improve his
   mortality and increase his morbidity.
   - call renal in AM, need recs for phos binder
   - F/U urine cx
   - continue calcitriol
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status - could be any combination of the above
   factors. Currently intubated and sedated. Suffered a recent parietal
   stroke.
   .
   #. DM2 - RISS and QID fingersticks.
   .
   #. Cards
       Rhythm: afib not on coumadin given GIB history, monitor on
   telemetry. Holding rate control agents. Also slow ventricular response,
   which is likely compromising forward flow given global hypokinesis and
   EF 20%, was started on dobutamine.
       Pump: Has large pleural effusion which has been tapped in past,
   transudative. Also has evidence of upper extremity and asymmetric lower
   extremity edema, and elevated JVP, which suggests total body volume
   overload, vs. third spacing. Requiring pressor support now, but this
   may be a function of poor forward flow. Holding diuretics, levophed and
   dobuta to increase ionotropy and EF.
       Coronaries: No evidence of active ischemia at this time. Hct stable
   at 29.6. CE's cycling, however elevated in setting of renal failure,
   they are within his baseline.
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - in the setting of renal failure. borderline at this
   time and trending down.  Pt was given a dose of kayexalate now awaiting
   BM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations, recently admitted for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). The patient was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient arrived with respiratory acidosis, likely secondary to altered mental status in the setting of a large right-sided pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Oxygenation is currently well on minimal vent settings, which can likely be weaned to pressure support (PS) by morning. The patient may need a backup rate and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has a broad differential, including hemorrhagic, cardiogenic, and septic shock. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility due to the patient's poor cardiac substrate. Septic shock is also a concern, although no obvious source of infection has been identified.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to poor forward flow from poor cardiac function. Dobutamine may help increase renal perfusion by maximizing ejection fraction (EF). Considering the patient's multiple comorbidities"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 0-10mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
   The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV
   diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild
   global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-2**], the left
   ventricular systolic function is better. The severity of tricuspid
   regurgitation and detected pulmonary artery systolic hypertension have
   increased. . The echocardiographic findings are consistent with
   restrictive cardiomyopathy (? Amyloid, Fabry's).

   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), recent admission for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (afib), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) stage 4, and altered mental status. The patient was transferred from rehab and found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Dyspnea: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation support. Further attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator should be considered while monitoring for any respiratory distress or worsening oxygenation.

2. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is still unclear. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and ongoing assessment of fluid status are necessary. Blood and urine cultures are pending, so empirical antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam should be continued. Severe diastolic dysfunction should be kept in mind while managing fluid administration.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 2-2.5, but the current creatinine level is 4.5. This likely indicates poor renal perfusion. A renal consult should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 109/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 30%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include a trans-thoracic echo and ultrasound performed on [**2110-6-5**]. The patient was awake but not responding to commands and seemed uncomfortable, biting on the endotracheal tube. A 0.5 mg dose of versed IV bolus was given. The patient's urine culture is growing yeast, and renal ultrasound shows no evidence of hydronephrosis but does reveal a small amount of ascites and a small right pleural effusion. Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound shows no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient was taken off dobutamine.

Medications include fentanyl and midazolam infusions, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's allergies include Benadryl (Injection) (Diphenhydramine Hcl). The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) given on [**2110-6-6**] at 04:27 AM.

Flow sheet data as of [**2110-6-6**] 05:18 AM shows the patient's temperature to be 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate at 77 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate at 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's CVP is 35 mmHg, total intake is 3,341 mL, total output is 533 mL, and urine output is 533 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

Physical examination findings include altered mental status, no peripheral vascular assessment, and no skin assessment. Neurologic examination reveals the patient responds to commands but movement, tone, and assessment are not documented. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels. The patient's creatinine level is within normal range, and troponin T levels are negative.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypothermia, and cardiogenic shock. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including arterial and multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR, but okay to intubate, and disposition is ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been in the ICU and received various treatments including dobutamine, norepinephrine, and diuretics. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 mmHg to 110/57 mmHg, heart rate between 69-88 bpm, respiratory rate at 10-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a PSV/SBT mode, FiO2 of 30%, and PEEP of 0 cmH2O. The patient's trans-thoracic echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. The patient's laboratory results indicate renal failure, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's mental status is altered, but not due to delirium. The patient is also experiencing hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest worsening renal function. If left untreated, this could lead to further decline in kidney function and potentially require renal replacement therapy.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of poor end-organ perfusion indicate cardiogenic shock"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleed, and now presents with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 mmHg to 66/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 inspiratory minutes, oxygen saturation of 98%, and atrial fibrillation as the heart rhythm.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy tube in place. The chest X-ray shows very mild bilateral pleural effusion at the right base, otherwise good air movement without wheezing. Physical examination reveals 3+ edema in the right lower extremity, soft hypoactive bowel sounds, and sedated but moving all four limbs.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 167 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 136 mg/dL, creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL, potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 24 mEq/L, blood glucose level of 136 mg/dL, and slightly elevated troponin T level of 0.11.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 to 110/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal ventilation.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been on dobutamine, which has been weaned off. The patient also has a history of confusion and delirium. The patient has received antibiotics, specifically Piperacillin/Tazobactam, for an unknown duration.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3,341 mL and output of 533 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,808 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with PSV/SBT ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 575 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 6 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 44, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 327.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 85-year-old male with cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure on stage IV chronic renal insufficiency, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and now presenting with shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been on CPAP/PSV ventilator support, and there are plans for extubation once the patient becomes more awake. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient likely has a mixed septic and cardiogenic shock picture due to suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), cardiomyopathy, and chronotropic insufficiency. The patient is currently off dobutamine and weaning off norepinephrine.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on CPAP mode with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and an RSBI of 73. The primary issues remain large effusions, volume overload, and possible laryngeal edema when moving to extubation.
3. Transudative Effusions: These are due to congestive heart failure (CHF), and the plan is to eventually perform diuresis versus repeat thoracentesis.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and renal dose medications should be followed.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes should be managed with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and shock. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 112/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 435 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal range.

Physical examination reveals bilateral lower extremity edema, with more prominence on the right side. His chest X-ray shows decreased breath sounds at both lung bases, more pronounced on the right side. The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and altered liver function tests.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient's mixed septic and cardiogenic shock is being managed with appropriate antibiotics and weaning off dobutamine and levophed.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure (on stage IV chronic renal insufficiency), recent gastrointestinal bleed, and shock.
- The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with respiratory failure.
- The patient has transudative effusions, possibly due to congestive heart failure.
- The patient also has diabetes mellitus type 2 and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's mixed septic and cardiogenic shock picture may contribute to further complications. The patient is off dobutamine and weaning off norepinephrine.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on CPAP 5/5 and has copious white, frothy oral secretions consistent with pulmonary edema. The plan is to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt and check post-morbid electrolytes. Primary issues include large effusions, volume overload, and potential laryngeal edema when extubating the patient.
3. Transudative effusions: These are likely due to congestive heart failure and may require diuresis, repeat thoracentesis, or continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and renal dose medications should be followed.
5. DM2: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), ARF (on stage IV CRI), recent
   GIB, now here with shock and respiratory failure.
   1. Shock: - DDX likely mixed septic and cardiogenic picture with
   suspect UTI, GIB, cardiomyopathy, chronotropic insufficiency all
   contributing. Now off dobuta and weaning levophed
                        - Sepsis: empiric Rx with vanco/Zosyn, follow up
   cx (neg DFA, sputum contaminant)
                        - GI bleed
 seen by GI, Hct stable at 27, Tx less
   than 30 sustained
                        - Cardiogenic: known EF 15- Echo yesterday better
   and 35-40.
                        -
   2. Respiratory failure
 on cpap 5/5.  Original plan to wean from went,
   but pt with copious white, frothy oral secretions c/w pulm edema, as
   seen with cxr as well.  Plan to diurese approximately 1 L negative with
   lasix gtt and check pm lytes. Primary issues remain large effusions,
   volume overload, and ? laryngeal edema on laryngoscope
 will need to
   be careful when move to extubation.  If lasix gtt does not improve
   volume status, consider cvvh and renal input.
   3. Transudative effusions - due to CHF, eventual diuresis versus repeat
   thoracentesis vs cvvh.
   4. Renal failure - follow, renal dose meds
   5. DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, ARF, recent gastrointestinal bleed, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with shock, likely a mixed septic and cardiogenic picture. He has also been diagnosed with respiratory failure and is on CPAP mode. The patient has transudative effusions due to congestive heart failure and renal failure. Additionally, the patient has diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's mixed septic and cardiogenic shock may lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs, potentially causing organ damage or failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure, combined with his inability to clear secretions, can increase the risk of pneumonia and further deterioration in lung function.
3. Transudative Effusions: The large effusions caused by congestive heart failure can lead to compression of surrounding structures, such as the lungs, and may require repeated thoracentesis or CVVH to manage.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure requires close monitoring and management, including renal dosing of medications and consideration of CVVH if fluid overload persists.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed through insulin sliding scale and AccuChecks to maintain glycemic control.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.
   .
   #. Dyspnea
   - patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with PEEP of 0 and PS of 5
   - continue sedation if pt is pulling at or biting tube
   - consider further attempts to wean the patient off of the ventilator
   should change pt
s femoral line to a central line before attempting to
   extubated patient, however
   .
   #. Hypotension
   - still no clear etiology
   - likely that this is not hemorrhagic shock
 GI has a low suspicion
   and the patient
s Hct
s are overall stable
   - pt did have a slight drop in Hct since yesterday, though, so will
   need to keep monitoring.
   - PE is also less likely because lower extremity ultrasounds were WNL.
   - blood and urine cx still pending - will treat empirically with
   vanc/zosyn as per yesterday
 need to renally dose vanc based off of
   vanc level
   - pt also has severe diastolic dysfunction so need to be careful with
   fluids
   - pt is off of dobutamine, getting norepi
   - will continue to hold all antihypertensives
   - need to resite the patient
s femoral line
 should be changed to a
   central line prior to extubating the patient
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - likely secondary to poor renal perfusion
   - follow-up renal consult
   .
   #. DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), recent admission for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (EF 20%), chronic renal insufficiency (stage 4), and altered mental status. The patient was transferred from rehabilitation for altered mental status and worsening renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.

The patient's current condition includes dyspnea, hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with PEEP of 0 and PS of 5, and continues to be sedated. The plan is to consider further attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator, but only after changing the patient's femoral line to a central line.

There is still no clear etiology for the patient's hypotension. Although GI bleeding is less likely, it is still being treated empirically with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) due to the presence of severe diastolic dysfunction. The patient's blood and urine cultures are still pending. Fluids need to be carefully managed due to the patient's severe diastolic dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, currently admitted to the ICU. They are experiencing altered mental status, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, hypothermia, and cardiogenic shock. The patient is on multiple medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, and fentanyl. They are receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube and are connected to various monitors and lines. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, but their mixed venous oxygen saturation is low at 58%. They have received blood transfusions and their urine output has been monitored. Several laboratory tests have been conducted, showing abnormalities in kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated levels of certain enzymes. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and interventions are being implemented to address their various issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration in mental status."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 85 yo M with a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently admitted
   for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI (stage 4), who
   was transferred from rehab for altered mental status and worsening
   renal function, found to be hypotensive, hypothermic, and bradycardic.
   .
   #. Dyspnea
   - patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with PEEP of 0 and PS of 5
   - continue sedation if pt is pulling at or biting tube
   - consider further attempts to wean the patient off of the ventilator
   should change pt
s femoral line to a central line before attempting to
   extubated patient, however
   .
   #. Hypotension
   - still no clear etiology
   - likely that this is not hemorrhagic shock
 GI has a low suspicion
   and the patient
s Hct
s are overall stable
   - pt did have a slight drop in Hct since yesterday, though, so will
   need to keep monitoring.
   - PE is also less likely because lower extremity ultrasounds were WNL.
   - blood and urine cx still pending - will treat empirically with
   vanc/zosyn as per yesterday
 need to renally dose vanc based off of
   vanc level
   - pt also has severe diastolic dysfunction so need to be careful with
   fluids
   - pt is off of dobutamine, getting norepi
   - will continue to hold all antihypertensives
   - need to resite the patient
s femoral line
 should be changed to a
   central line prior to extubating the patient
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   - likely secondary to poor renal perfusion
   - follow-up renal consult
   .
   #. DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of gastric/small bowel arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), recent admission for shock attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) stage 4, and altered mental status. The patient was transferred from rehab for hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a PEEP of 0 and PS of 5. Sedation will be continued if the patient pulls at or bites the tube. Further attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator should be considered after changing the femoral line to a central line.

The patient's hypotension remains without clear etiology. Hemorrhagic shock is unlikely due to stable hematocrit (Hct) levels. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also less likely as lower extremity ultrasounds were normal. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), with vancomycin dosing based on renal function. The patient should be cautious with fluids due to severe diastolic dysfunction. Dobutamine has been stopped,"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute of chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - septic vs. cardiogenic vs. combination of both.  Pt is off
   of dobutamine and is currently on norepi at 0.12.
   - likely that this is not hypovolemic shock [**1-13**] to GI bleeding.
   Despite pts h/o GIB, his Hct is relatively stable and GI does not
   suspect GIB.  Will continue to closely monitor Hct, however, as pt
   Hct has trending down slightly.
   - no clear septic etiologies at this point.  Pt is on empiric
   vanco/zosyn.
   - will follow up blood cx.  Urine cultures growing yeast.
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on cpap [**7-19**].  Plan was to wean from
   went, but pt with copious white, frothy oral secretions c/w pulm edema,
   as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed to diurese approximately 1
   L negative with lasix gtt.
   - lasix gtt stopped [**1-13**] low BP
   - f/u CXR this morning to look at status of pulmonary edema
   - other obstacles to extubation are transudative pleural effusions and
   laryngeal edema.  Will need to be careful when extubating
   - will need to consider CVVH for fluid status if it continues to be a
   problem
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - eventual diuresis versus repeat thoracentesis vs cvvh.
   # Renal failure
   - continue to follow BUN/Cr
   - renal dosing of meds
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   # Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute or chronic renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 100/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode and receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions.

The patient has skin breakdown at the base of the penis and along the shaft, leading to a request for wound care consult. He also has edematous changes in the affected area. The patient's allergies include Benadryl (Injection) (Diphenhydramine Hcl), and he has a last dose of antibiotics, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), at 04:00 AM on [**2110-6-8**].

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent development of skin breakdown. His medical and family history remain unchanged. The patient's flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid balance issues, with total in/out balance of"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute of chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   1. Shock: - septic vs. cardiogenic vs. combination of both.
   - likely that this is not hypovolemic shock [**1-13**] to GI bleeding.
   Despite pts h/o GIB, his Hct is relatively stable and GI does not
   suspect GIB.  Will continue to closely monitor Hct, however, as pt
   Hct has trending down slightly.
   - Now off dobuta and weaning levophed
                        - Sepsis: empiric Rx with vanco/Zosyn, follow up
   cx (neg DFA, sputum contaminant)
                        - GI bleed
 seen by GI, Hct stable at 27, Tx less
   than 30 sustained
                        - Cardiogenic: known EF 15- Echo yesterday better
   and 35-40.
                        -
   2. Respiratory failure
 on cpap 5/5.  Original plan to wean from went,
   but pt with copious white, frothy oral secretions c/w pulm edema, as
   seen with cxr as well.  Plan to diurese approximately 1 L negative with
   lasix gtt and check pm lytes. Primary issues remain large effusions,
   volume overload, and ? laryngeal edema on laryngoscope
 will need to
   be careful when move to extubation.  If lasix gtt does not improve
   volume status, consider cvvh and renal input.
   3. Transudative effusions - due to CHF, eventual diuresis versus repeat
   thoracentesis vs cvvh.
   4. Renal failure - follow, renal dose meds
   5. DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   6. Altered Mental Status

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (stage IV renal failure), recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 100/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set FiO2 of 30%, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and RR (spontaneous) of 8 breaths per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient may be experiencing septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or a combination of both. The cause of shock needs to be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode of mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The frothy oral secretions and pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray suggest possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Diuresis with lasix gtt and checking post-lumbar puncture (pm) electrolytes are planned.
3. Transudative Effusions: The patient has large effusions that are likely due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute of chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - cardiogenic vs. combination of septic and cardiogenic.  Pt
   is off of dobutamine and is currently on norepi at 0.11.
   - likely that this is not hypovolemic shock [**1-13**] to GI bleeding.
   Despite pts h/o GIB, his Hct is relatively stable and GI does not
   suspect GIB.  Also, CVP is 23-30.  Will continue to closely monitor
   Hct, however, as pt
s Hct has trended down slightly.
   - no clear septic etiologies at this point.  Pt is on empiric
   vanco/zosyn, with vanc being doesd by level.
   - will follow up blood cx.  Urine cultures growing yeast.
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - will restart pt on dobutamine for increased contractility
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on cpap [**7-19**].  Plan was to wean from
   went, but pt with copious white, frothy oral secretions c/w pulm edema,
   as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed to diurese approximately 1
   L negative with lasix gtt.
   - lasix gtt stopped [**1-13**] low BP
   - f/u CXR this morning to look at status of pulmonary edema
   - other obstacles to extubation are transudative pleural effusions and
   laryngeal edema.  Will need to be careful when extubating
   - will need to consider CVVH for fluid status if it continues to be a
   problem
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - eventual diuresis versus repeat thoracentesis vs cvvh.
   # Renal failure
   - continue to follow BUN/Cr
   - renal dosing of meds
   - dose vanc by level
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   # Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute or chronic renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been off dobutamine and is on norepinephrine at 0.11. His hemoglobin (Hct) level is relatively stable, but there is a slight trend downwards. The patient is intubated and on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode, but the plan to wean him off ventilator was changed due to copious white, frothy oral secretions consistent with pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray. He has transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema, which are obstacles to extubation. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening heart failure.
2. Septic shock due to possible infection indicated by the presence of yeast in urine cultures.
3. Respiratory failure exacerbated by pulmonary edema and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Renal failure leading to electrolyte imbalances and difficulty in managing medications.
5. Altered mental status and confusion due to sedation or underlying conditions.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including:

1. Dark stools: The patient has been observed to have very dark stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). This could be related to his history of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has been steadily decreasing, leading to anemia. This may be due to ongoing blood loss from GIB or other causes.

3. Shock: The patient is currently receiving inotropic support with dobutamine to address cardiogenic shock. The exact cause of the shock is still uncertain, but it may be a combination of septic and cardiogenic factors.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary edema. Efforts to wean the patient off the ventilator have been unsuccessful so far.

5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the rising levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr). This could be due to decreased renal perfusion secondary to shock.

6. Transudative effusions:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic renal failure, who is currently admitted to the ICU for shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on CPAP/PSV ventilation. He is receiving inotropic support with dobutamine and vasopressor support with norepinephrine. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/54 to 112/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 35.7°C.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and the presence of atrial fibrillation. Physical examination reveals clear lungs with decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung, swelling in the extremities, and a firm abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's labs indicate elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin, leukocytosis, and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment includes cardiogenic shock, acute or chronic renal failure, recent GIB, and respiratory failure. The plan includes continuing dobutamine for inotropic support, monitoring for septic etiologies, following up with blood cultures, and considering CVVH for fluid status management. The patient's respiratory failure requires ongoing ventilation support and careful consideration"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute of chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - cardiogenic vs. combination of septic and cardiogenic.  Pt
   is back on dobutamine for inotropic support and is currently on norepi
   at 0.11.
   - likely that this is not hypovolemic shock [**1-13**] to GI bleeding.
   Despite pts h/o GIB, his Hct is relatively stable and GI does not
   suspect GIB.  Also, CVP is 23-30.  Will continue to closely monitor
   Hct, however, as pt
s Hct has trended down slightly.
   - no clear septic etiologies at this point.  Pt is on empiric
   vanco/zosyn, with vanc being doesd by level.
   - will follow up blood cx.  Urine cultures growing yeast.
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - will restart pt on dobutamine for increased contractility
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on cpap [**7-19**].  Plan was to wean from
   went, but pt with copious white, frothy oral secretions c/w pulm edema,
   as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed to diurese approximately 1
   L negative with lasix gtt.
   - lasix gtt stopped [**1-13**] low BP
   - f/u CXR this morning to look at status of pulmonary edema
   - other obstacles to extubation are transudative pleural effusions and
   laryngeal edema.  Will need to be careful when extubating
   - will need to consider CVVH for fluid status if it continues to be a
   problem
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - eventual diuresis versus repeat thoracentesis vs cvvh.
   # Renal failure
   - continue to follow BUN/Cr
   - renal dosing of meds
   - dose vanc by level
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   # Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, NPO

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the ICU for shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been restarted on dobutamine for inotropic support and is receiving a Lasix drip. He is also on other medications including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock due to his CHF and possibly a combination of septic and cardiogenic causes. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and adjustment of medications as needed will be necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on CPAP. Due to the presence of copious white, frothy oral secretions and pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray, the plan to wean him from the ventilator has been changed. Diuretics are being used to manage the fluid overload, and further evaluation of the pulmonary edema is planned.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): Although the patient has a history of GIB, there is no clear evidence of active bleeding at the moment. However, close monitoring of the patient's hematocrit levels and stool color will be necessary.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and ongoing monitoring of BUN/Cr levels will be necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications, including dobutamine, norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, and others. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/55 to 112/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature of 35.7°C. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of melena and apnea when on pressure support ventilation (PSV) today.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 144 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 4.8 to 5.0 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 111 to 174 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 24 mEq/L and hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L.

The patient has several medical complications, including impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, and constipation. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased perfusion.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion and delirium may worsen without appropriate management.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output indicate renal dysfunction. ARF can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and decreased oxygen saturation indicate severe lung dysfunction. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and hypoxemia.
5. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and low cardiac output suggest cardiogenic shock. This can result in poor organ perfusion and increased mortality.
6. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to decreased mobility and use of certain medications. Constipation can lead to discomfort, distension, and potential complications like fecal impaction.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based solely on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with multiple health issues, including cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and respiratory failure. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been experiencing various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely suffering from cardiogenic shock due to his pre-existing cardiomyopathy and recent GI bleed. He requires inotropic support with dobutamine and is also on norepinephrine for hemodynamic stabilization. There is also a concern for sepsis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be attributed to large effusions, volume overload, and possible laryngeal edema. He is currently on assisted ventilation, but efforts to wean him off will need to be cautious, especially considering the possibility of laryngeal edema during extubation.

3. GI Bleed: The patient has had recurrent GI bleeding, which is currently being managed with the transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned once the patient is stable.

4. Transudative Effusions: The patient's effusions are likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF). Diuretic therapy may be needed to manage these effusions.

5. Renal Failure: The patient's renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and respiratory failure. He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with shock, suspected to be a combination of septic and cardiogenic, along with respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and decreased urine output. His oxygen saturation is within normal range. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device.

The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormal levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The physical examination reveals signs of altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and constipation.

The patient's medical history includes cardiomyopathy, which may contribute to his current condition. His renal function is compromised, as indicated by the acute renal failure. The patient has also experienced a recent GI bleed, which requires further evaluation and management.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Shock: The patient's mixed septic and cardiogenic shock requires careful management. Immediate interventions include administering blood products and dobutamine, adjusting vasopressor medications, and monitoring central venous pressure (CVP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient"

   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute of chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - cardiogenic vs. combination of septic and cardiogenic.  Pt
   is back on dobutamine (at 5) for inotropic support and is currently on
   norepi (at 0.13).
   - no clear septic etiologies at this point.  Pt is on empiric
   vanco/zosyn, with vanc being dosed by level.
   - will follow up blood cx.  Urine cultures growing yeast.
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - pt was on lasix drip, but this was stopped
 per nursing, it had no
   effect on his UOP
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on cpap [**7-19**].  Plan was to wean from
   vent several days ago, but pt with copious white, frothy oral
   secretions c/w pulm edema, as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed
   to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt.  Lasix gtt
   stopped [**1-13**] low BP
s but then was restarted yesterday.  Stopped again
   after it had no real effect on pt
s UOP.
   - f/u CXR this morning to look for any changes in patient
s effusions /
   pulmonary edema
   - other obstacles to extubation are transudative pleural effusions and
   laryngeal edema.  Will need to be careful when extubating
   - will need to consider CVVH for fluid status if it continues to be a
   problem
   - pt did not tolerate his [**Name (NI) 866**]
   # Anemia
 pt has a steadily dropping Hct (27.0 -> 26.1 -> 22.9).
   Also, per nursing, pt has had some very dark stools.
   - will transfuse 2 units of blood SLOWLY (each over 4 hrs)
   - will carefully monitor pt
s fluid status as he receives these units
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - eventual diuresis versus repeat thoracentesis vs cvvh.
   # Renal failure
   - continue to follow BUN/Cr
 trending up, likely secondary to
   decreased renal perfusion
 further supported by patient
s small UOP
   - renal dosing of meds
   - dose vanc by level
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   # Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, on TF

   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - cardiogenic vs. combination of septic and cardiogenic.  Pt
   is back on dobutamine (at 5) for inotropic support and is currently on
   levophed (at 0.1).
   - no clear septic etiologies at this point.  Pt is on empiric
   vanco/zosyn, with vanc being dosed by level. (day 6 of zosyn?)
   - urine cx with yeast x3; sputum cx ([**6-4**]) no growth; sputum cx ([**6-6**])
   contaminated; blood cx PENDING
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - pt not longer on lasix gtt, as it was not having significant effect
   on his UOP
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on cpap [**7-19**].  Plan was to wean from
   vent several days ago, but pt with copious white, frothy oral
   secretions c/w pulm edema, as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed
   to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt.  Lasix gtt
   stopped [**1-13**] low BP
s but then was restarted yesterday.  Stopped again
   after it had no real effect on pt
s UOP.
   - pt did not tolerate his RSBI
   - CXR ordered for this morning.  Will f/u to evaluate for changes in
   pt
s effusions or pulmonary edema
   - If pt eventually ex extubated, will need to take care secondary to
   her transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to
   be careful when extubating.
   - if fluid overload continues, CVVH an option
 but not sure if this
   will be a good option in this patient
   # Anemia
 Hct rose to 27.6 (from 22.9) after 2 units of blood.  Now,
   Hct holding steady at 25.5.
   - ordered a Hct for 3pm
 will f/u
   - continue to trend pt
s Hct
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - eventual diuresis versus repeat thoracentesis vs cvvh
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - BUN steady at 88; Cr down slightly today to 5.1 (from 5.5)
   - UOP 390 mL total yesterday
   - renal dosing of meds
   - dose vanc by level
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   # Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, on TF

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 102/45 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 

The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and is receiving inotropic support with dobutamine. He is also on levophed for vasopressor support. The patient has been empirically started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for potential sepsis, but cultures have not yet returned. 

The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and he has received approximately 1 liter of negative fluid with lasix gtt. However, the lasix gtt was stopped due to low blood pressure but restarted yesterday and then stopped again as it had no significant effect on his urine output. 

The patient's respiratory failure is believed to be secondary to CHF exacerbation, as evidenced by frothy oral secretions and pulmonary edema"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic stage IV renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient is currently in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate (HR) of 72 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 102/45 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF). 

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is sedated and intubated, with clear lungs but decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung. There is significant edema in the arms and legs. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, with slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

The patient's plan includes continuing inotropic support with dobutamine and vasopressor therapy with norepinephrine due to cardiogenic shock. Empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam is being continued for another day and will be discontinued"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute of chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - cardiogenic vs. combination of septic and cardiogenic.  Pt
   is back on dobutamine (at 5) for inotropic support and is currently on
   norepi (at 0.13).
   - no clear septic etiologies at this point.  Pt is on empiric
   vanco/zosyn, with vanc being dosed by level.
   - will follow up blood cx.  Urine cultures growing yeast.
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - pt was on lasix drip, but this was stopped
 per nursing, it had no
   effect on his UOP
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on cpap [**7-19**].  Plan was to wean from
   vent several days ago, but pt with copious white, frothy oral
   secretions c/w pulm edema, as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed
   to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt.  Lasix gtt
   stopped [**1-13**] low BP
s but then was restarted yesterday.  Stopped again
   after it had no real effect on pt
s UOP.
   - f/u CXR this morning to look for any changes in patient
s effusions /
   pulmonary edema
   - other obstacles to extubation are transudative pleural effusions and
   laryngeal edema.  Will need to be careful when extubating
   - will need to consider CVVH for fluid status if it continues to be a
   problem
   # Anemia
 pt has a steadily dropping Hct (27.0 -> 26.1 -> 22.9).
   Also, per nursing, pt has had some very dark stools.
   - will transfuse 2 units of blood SLOWLY (each over 4 hrs)
   - will carefully monitor pt
s fluid status as he receives these units
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - eventual diuresis versus repeat thoracentesis vs cvvh.
   # Renal failure
   - continue to follow BUN/Cr
 trending up, likely secondary to
   decreased renal perfusion
 further supported by patient
s small UOP
   - renal dosing of meds
   - dose vanc by level
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints are respiratory failure and shock. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, dobutamine, and norepinephrine. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, low urine output, and altered mental status. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The blood gas analysis indicates a normal pH level but slightly elevated PaCO2. The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, and previous episodes of hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the use of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The presence of multi-organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and positive blood cultures may indicate sepsis.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure, low urine output, and signs of organ dysfunction suggest cardiogenic shock.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (B"

   85 yr old man with cardiomyopathy, ARF, recent GI bleed, now here with
   shock and resp failure
   1. Shock: - Mainly a cardiogenic picture with suspect UTI, GIB,
   cardiomyopathy, chronotropic insufficiency all contributing. Has not
   been able to come off Levophed and is also on Dobuta for inotropic
   support.
                        - Sepsis: empiric Rx with vanco/Zosyn, follow up
   cx neg to date complete 7 day course
                        - Cardiogenic: known EF 20-30% try to wean
   dobutamine and trend SCVo2. If we cannot get off dobutamine will need
   to discuss goals of care versus CVVH trial
   2. Respiratory failure
 in setting of shock, back on AC. However
   primary issues remain large effusions, volume overload, and ? laryngeal
   edema on laryngoscope
 will need to be careful when move to
   extubation. Try to get back to PSV later today but with volume
   overload. And sedation this will be a challenge.
   3. GI bleed: stable after Tx
   4. Renal failure - follow, renal dose meds, will need to decide HD/CVVH
   in near future but his overall course would lead me to believe this is
   not indicated given his poor prognosis -

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, shock, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a cardiac rhythm of atrial fibrillation. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/45-126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has several medical complications, including:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, likely due to a combination of factors such as a urinary tract infection (UTI), GI bleed, cardiomyopathy, and chronotropic insufficiency. The patient is receiving inotropic support with dobutamine and vasopressor support with norepinephrine.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to large effusions, volume overload, and laryngeal edema. He is currently on assisted mechanical ventilation.
3. GI bleed: The patient had a recent GI bleed that has been stabilized after treatment.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which requires careful monitoring and consideration of dialysis options.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities, including elevated blood glucose levels, elevated lactate acid levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleed, and currently experiencing shock and respiratory failure. He has been treated for suspected sepsis but no signs of infection were found. The patient's primary issues include large effusions, volume overload, and laryngeal edema, which may complicate extubation. The patient has stable vital signs, but his prognosis is poor. He is on mechanical ventilation, multiple vasoactive medications, and renal replacement therapy may be needed soon. The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's known low ejection fraction (20-30%) and the need for inotropic support suggest an underlying cardiac issue contributing to his shock state. This can be life-threatening if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to wean off mechanical ventilation and the presence of large effusions and volume overload indicate a significant respiratory compromise. Extubation may be challenging due to laryngeal edema.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires careful monitoring and management. Decisions regarding renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, need to be made considering the patient's overall prognosis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed: Although the patient's gastrointestinal bleed appears to have stabilized after treatment, ongoing monitoring is necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute on chronic stage IV renal failure. He has been admitted to the MICU for shock and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, and transudative pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of CHF and the current presentation with shock indicate a potential complication of cardiogenic shock. This is supported by the use of inotropic support with dobutamine and vasopressor with levophed.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion. This requires careful monitoring and management of renal function.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator has been attempted but unsuccessful due to copious white, frothy oral secretions consistent with pulmonary edema. Diuretics have been used to address fluid overload, but with limited effectiveness.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) indicates a potential ongoing or recurrent bleeding event. Continued monitoring and management of blood products and coag"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleed, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, and transudative pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by inadequate blood flow to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to the presence of frothy oral secretions and pulmonary edema.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management of fluid and electrolyte balance are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB, and there is a possibility of ongoing bleeding. Monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and coagulation parameters is essential.
5. Constipation: The patient is at risk of constipation due to immobility and medications"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and stage IV renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for shock and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 35.5°C, Heart rate 74 bpm, Blood pressure 108/53 mmHg, Respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 100%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 25 mmHg, Mixed venous oxygen saturation 57-59%.
- Fluid balance: Total input 1,283 mL, Total output 605 mL.
- Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, Controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and auto flow, Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 30%, Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O, Plateau pressure 26 cmH2O.
- Medications: Midazolam, Fentanyl, Norepinephrine, Pantoprazole, Piperacillin/tazobactam (stopped), Vancomycin (dose adjusted by level).
- Lab results: White blood cell count (WBC) 7.3 K/uL, Hematocrit (Hct) 26.9%, Platelet count (Plt) 100 K/uL, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 88 mg/dL, Creatinine (Cr) 4.9 mg/dL, Sodium (Na+) 146 mg/dL, Potassium (K+) 4.9 mEq/L, Glucose 171 mg/dL.

Assessment and plan:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to severe CHF with an ejection fraction of 20%. There are no septic etiologies identified, as indicated by negative blood cultures and WBC within normal limits. Empiric antibiotics have been stopped. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation has improved with the use of dobutamine, but it is not significantly different when dobutamine is weaned off. Therefore, the decision has been made not to restart dobutamine. The goal is to wean down norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted controlled ventilation with PEEP at 8 cmH2O. Weaning from the ventilator was attempted several days ago, but the patient had copious white, frothy oral secretions consistent with pulmonary edema. The plan is to continue diuresis with Lasix to address fluid overload and prevent further pulmonary edema. A chest X-ray will be ordered to evaluate for changes in effusions or pulmonary edema. If the patient is eventually extubated, caution should be exercised due to trans"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and stage IV renal failure. He has recently experienced gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to his history of CHF and low ejection fraction. The use of levophed indicates that the patient's blood pressure needs to be maintained, suggesting ongoing instability.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about pulmonary edema and the possibility of extubation-related complications such as transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are slightly improving. However, there is ongoing fluid overload, which may require further management, such as continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, and his blood glucose levels need to be monitored and managed with insulin sliding scale.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to sedation and the underlying medical conditions.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate (HR) of 74 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 108/53 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient is sedated, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to hemodynamic instability, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by low blood pressure and the need for norepinephrine (levophed) support. No septic etiologies have been identified, as indicated by negative blood cultures and WBC within normal limits. The patient will continue to be monitored for signs of improvement or worsening, and dobutamine will not be restarted since the mixed venous oxygen saturation did not"

He has been intubated and sedated but becomes agitated when awake. His vital signs show atrial fibrillation, low blood pressure, and high heart rate. He is receiving inotropic support with dobutamine and vasopressor with Levophed. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. He is receiving midazolam and fentanyl for sedation. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hypothermia, and cardiogenic shock. The shock is primarily cardiogenic with suspected urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal bleed, cardiomyopathy, and chronotropic insufficiency contributing. He is on dobutamine and Levophed for inotropic support. The respiratory failure is due to large effusions, volume overload, and possible laryngeal edema. Acute renal failure is progressive due to volume overload, and the family wants a trial of continuous renal replacement therapy. The gastrointestinal bleed is stable after treatment.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, now presenting with shock and respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is mainly due to cardiomyopathy, but other factors such as urinary tract infection (UTI) and GI bleeding may also contribute. The patient has not been able to come off Levophed and is on Dobutamine for inotropic support. The team needs to continue monitoring and managing the patient's hemodynamics.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily due to large effusions, volume overload, and possible laryngeal edema. The team needs to carefully consider the timing of extubation and attempt to return to pressure support ventilation (PSV) later in the day. Sedation management will also be a challenge.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is progressively worsening due to volume overload. The team discussed continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) as a potential treatment option, and the family wants to try it.

4. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed is stable after treatment.

Other remaining issues include managing the patient's nutrition, maintaining glycemic control, and ensuring appropriate lines and prophylaxis measures. The patient's code status is DNR (do"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, shock, and respiratory failure. The patient's main medical complications include cardiogenic shock, sepsis (which was ruled out with negative cultures), respiratory failure, GI bleed, and ARF.

The patient's current vital signs indicate a temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/69 to 91/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 293, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated but becomes agitated when awake. He has coarse bilateral bronchial sounds, distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds,"

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, calcium gluconate, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and need for vasopressor support suggest possible cardiogenic shock, which can be a complication of CHF.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. This may be due to pulmonary edema secondary to CHF.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has stage IV renal failure, and his creatinine levels are elevated. It is important to monitor for any further"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, there have been several significant events in the past 24 hours.

The patient underwent the placement of a dialysis catheter, replacement of an OG tube, initiation of continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH), and updates given to both daughters. 

The patient is currently on several infusions including midazolam, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (for CRRT), and norepinephrine. They are also receiving pantoprazole and other medications.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, gastrointestinal bleed, constipation, impaired skin integrity, and impaired bowel movements.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but their blood pressure is on the lower side. Their heart rate is normal, respiration rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is high.

The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and their central venous pressure (CVP) is within the normal range. Cardiac output and cardiac index are decreased, mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 60%, and there is a negative fluid balance.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cm"

   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - likely cardiogenic.  Pt is currently on levophed at 0.12
   (did have to go up to 0.16 overnight, though).
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - pt
s mixed venous O2 sat this morning: 60
   - attempt to wean down levophed as tolerated to keep MAP > 60
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on AC with a PEEP of 8.  Plan was to
   wean from vent several days ago, but pt with copious white, frothy oral
   secretions c/w pulm edema, as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed
   to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt.  Lasix gtt
   stopped [**1-13**] low BP
s but then was restarted yesterday.  Stopped again
   after it had no real effect on pt
s UOP.
   - consider attempting another RSBI if patient can be switched back to
   PS in the next few days
   - pt started on CVVH yesterday
 671 mL fluid removed last night
   (between 7pm and midnight)
 will continue to monitor whether patient
   can tolerate CVVH without elevated need for pressors
   - CXR improved this morning
   - If pt eventually ex extubated, will need to take care secondary to
   her transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to
   be careful when extubating.
   # Leukocytosis
   - no septic etiologies identified.  Pt was on empiric vanc/zosyn, but
   they were stopped yesterday.
   - Now, WBC up to 14.5.  Pt afebrile, however.
   - Possible infectious etiology
 consider blood and urine cx
   # Anemia
 Hct steady/improving
 now at 26.6
   - continue to trend pt
s Hct
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - Pt is on CVVH to remove some fluid
   - Continue to monitor effusions on serial CXR
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - Cr improved today 3.5 on CVVH
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   # Altered Mental Status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to CHF. Fluid status should be closely monitored, and the chest X-ray should be followed. Levophed should be titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted control ventilation with a PEEP of 8. Weaning from the ventilator was planned several days ago but was delayed due to the presence of copious white, frothy oral secretions consistent with pulmonary edema, as seen on the chest X-ray. Diuretics (Lasix) were started to remove approximately 1 L of fluid but were stopped due to low blood pressure and then restarted yesterday. Another attempt to wean from the ventilator may be made if the patient can be switched back to pressure support in"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 115/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient has significant edema in all four extremities and a firm abdomen with bowel sounds present.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to CHF. Fluid status should be closely monitored, and the chest X-ray (CXR) should be followed. The goal is to remove at least 100 mL per hour of fluid via continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and titrate up vasopressor (levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted control ("

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and now presents with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's main medical complications include heart failure, respiratory failure, GI bleed, ARF, leukocytosis, and altered mental status.

Heart failure: The patient has a cardiogenic picture with suspected underlying urinary tract infection (UTI), GI bleed, cardiomyopathy, and chronotropic insufficiency contributing to his heart failure. He is currently being treated with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to manage volume overload.

Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure in the setting of positive pressure ventilation, heart failure, large effusions, and possible laryngeal edema during initial intubation. The goal is to transition from controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) to pressure support ventilation (PSV) later today.

GI bleed: The patient had a GI bleed that was stabilized after treatment. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed without acute lesions. The patient will be monitored clinically, and repeat EGD will be considered if there are signs of rebleeding.

ARF: CVVH is being used for volume management in the patient's ARF.

Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, and tests for Clostridium difficile (C"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - likely cardiogenic.  Pt is currently on levophed at 0.14
   - continue to follow pt
s fluid status and CXR
   - obtain another mixed venous O2 sat today to assess effectiveness of
   CVVH
   - continue CVVH fluid removal, titrating up levophed to keep MAP>60
   - goal of 100 cc/hr fluid removal
   - need to meet with family in the next day or two to address
   effectiveness of CVVH, long-term prognosis, and goals of care
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on AC with a PEEP of 8.  Pt has had
   problems with extubation previously, first [**1-13**] increased frothy
   secretions and also [**1-13**] to failed RSBI.
   - pt failed RSBI several days ago
 will ultimately need to wean
   patient to PS and attempt another RSBI; however, fluid removal via CVVH
   is more pressing at this time
   - pt started on CVVH Wednesday night
 1.8 fluid removed yesterday
   - goal fluid removal of 100 cc/hr
 titrate up levo[phed as needed to
   maintain fluid removal
   - If pt eventually ex extubated, will need to take care secondary to
   her transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to
   be careful when extubating.
   # Leukocytosis
   - no septic etiologies identified previously.
   - pt had white count to 14.5 yesterday
 pan cultured
   - WBC now down to 11.1
   - prelim sputum culture showed budding yeast; blood and urine cultures
   - need to send stool cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC at this point
   # Anemia
 Hct fairly steady at 25.3 (27.4 -> 26.6 -> 25.3)
   - continue to trend pt
s Hct
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - Pt is on CVVH to remove some fluid
   - Continue to monitor effusions on serial CXR
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - Cr improved today 1.3 on CVVH

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and stage IV renal failure, who is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to shock and respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on assisted ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The patient has experienced issues with previous extubations, including increased frothy secretions and failed rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). He is also experiencing transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, as indicated by the use of norepinephrine (Levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient's fluid status and chest X-ray will be closely monitored, and mixed venous oxygen saturation will be obtained to assess the effectiveness of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. Due to previous difficulties with extubation, the patient will need to be weaned off the ventilator gradually and undergo another RSBI assessment. Fluid removal via CVVH is currently a priority.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood"

   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - likely cardiogenic.  Pt is currently on levophed at 0.14
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - pt
s mixed venous O2 sat this morning: 60
   - will try to get more fluid off via CVVH (goal of at least 100 mL per
   hour) and titrate up levophed to keep MAP>60
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on AC with a PEEP of 8.  Plan was to
   wean from vent several days ago, but pt with copious white, frothy oral
   secretions c/w pulm edema, as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed
   to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt.  Lasix gtt
   stopped [**1-13**] low BP
s but then was restarted yesterday.  Stopped again
   after it had no real effect on pt
s UOP.
   - pt failed RSBI several days ago
 will ultimately need to wean
   patient to PS and attempt another RSBI; however, the fluid removal via
   CVVH is more pressing at this time
   - pt started on CVVH yesterday
 671 mL fluid removed last night
   (between 7pm and midnight)
 will continue to monitor whether patient
   can tolerate CVVH
   - will attempt to increase fluid removal via CVVH and titrate pressors
   as needed to maintain MAP
   - If pt eventually ex extubated, will need to take care secondary to
   her transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to
   be careful when extubating.
   # Leukocytosis
   - no septic etiologies identified.  Pt was on empiric vanc/zosyn, but
   they were stopped yesterday.
   - Now, WBC up to 14.5.  Pt afebrile; however, CVVH will blunt the
   febrile response
   - Blood, urine, sputum, and stool cx to be sent
   # Anemia
 Hct steady/improving
 now at 26.6
   - continue to trend pt
s Hct
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - Pt is on CVVH to remove some fluid
   - Continue to monitor effusions on serial CXR
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - Cr improved today 3.5 on CVVH
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks.
   # Altered Mental Status

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to shock and respiratory failure. The patient's mixed venous O2 saturation is low at 60%. He has copious white, frothy oral secretions consistent with pulmonary edema, as seen on chest X-ray. The plan is to attempt to wean the patient off the ventilator using pressure support (PS) and perform another rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) test. However, fluid removal via continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) is more pressing at this time. The patient's white blood cell count has increased to 14.5, but no septic etiologies have been identified. Blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures will be sent. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is improving at 26.6. Transudative effusions persist, and the patient is on CVVH to remove some fluid. Renal failure is likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion, and the patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 should be managed with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks. The patient's altered mental status may be difficult to assess due to sedation. Electrolytes should be monitored regularly, and the patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Shock: - likely cardiogenic.  Pt is currently on levophed at 0.14
   - continue to follow pt
s fluid status and CXR
   - obtain another mixed venous O2 sat today to assess effectiveness of
   CVVH
   - continue CVVH fluid removal, titrating up levophed to keep MAP>60
   - goal of 100 cc/hr fluid removal
   - need to meet with family in the next day or two to address
   effectiveness of CVVH, long-term prognosis, and goals of care
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on AC with a PEEP of 8.  Plan was to
   wean from vent several days ago, but pt with copious white, frothy oral
   secretions c/w pulm edema, as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed
   to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt.  Lasix gtt
   stopped [**1-13**] low BP
s but then was restarted yesterday.  Stopped again
   after it had no real effect on pt
s UOP.
   - pt failed RSBI several days ago
 will ultimately need to wean
   patient to PS and attempt another RSBI; however, the fluid removal via
   CVVH is more pressing at this time
   - pt started on CVVH yesterday
 671 mL fluid removed last night
   (between 7pm and midnight)
 will continue to monitor whether patient
   can tolerate CVVH
   - will attempt to increase fluid removal via CVVH and titrate pressors
   as needed to maintain MAP
   - If pt eventually ex extubated, will need to take care secondary to
   her transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to
   be careful when extubating.
   # Leukocytosis
   - no septic etiologies identified.  Pt was on empiric vanc/zosyn, but
   they were stopped yesterday.
   - Now, WBC up to 14.5.  Pt afebrile; however, CVVH will blunt the
   febrile response
   - Blood, urine, sputum, and stool cx to be sent
   # Anemia
 Hct steady/improving

   - continue to trend pt
s Hct
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Transudative effusions

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, acute on chronic stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure.

The patient is experiencing several medical complications that can arise from their current condition. These include:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to their history of CHF and low ejection fraction. They are being treated with norepinephrine (levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted mechanical ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. They were initially planned to be weaned from the ventilator several days ago, but their condition worsened with the development of pulmon edema, leading to a change in the plan to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix. However, due to low blood pressure, the lasix was stopped again but later restarted yesterday.

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute on chronic stage IV renal failure. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) was started yesterday and"

   - continue to follow pt
s fluid status and CXR
   - obtain another mixed venous O2 sat today to assess effectiveness of
   CVVH
   - continue CVVH fluid removal, titrating up levophed to keep MAP>50
   (try to keep around 55)
   - goal fluid removal: as much at the patient can tolerate
   - need to meet with family in the next day or two to address
   effectiveness of CVVH, long-term prognosis, and goals of care
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on AC with a PEEP of 8.  Pt has had
   problems with extubation previously, first [**1-13**] increased frothy
   secretions and also [**1-13**] to failed RSBI.
   - pt failed RSBI several days ago
 will ultimately need to wean
   patient to PS and attempt another RSBI; however, fluid removal via CVVH
   is more pressing at this time
   - pt started on CVVH Wednesday night
 1.8 fluid removed yesterday
   - goal is to maximize fluid removal, titrating up levophed as needed to
   maintain fluid removal
   - If pt eventually extubated, will need to take care secondary to her
   transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to be
   careful when extubating.
   # Leukocytosis
   - no septic etiologies identified previously.
   - pt had white count to 14.5 yesterday

   - prelim sputum culture showed budding yeast; blood and urine cultures
   PENDING
   - continue to monitor WBC at this point , keeping in mind that pt will
   not mount a febrile response while on CVVH
   - will also send stool cultures is patient clinically deteriorates or
   WBC re-elevates

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, stage IV renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, blood pressure of 107/53 mmHg, heart rate of 65 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.

The patient has significant pitting edema and a history of previous problems with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to remove excess fluid. The goal is to maximize fluid removal while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50.

The patient also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.5, which has now decreased to 11.1. Preliminary sputum culture showed budding yeast, and blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is fairly steady at 25.3%, and he"

   failure.
   # Shock: - likely cardiogenic.  Pt is currently on levophed at 0.14
   (did have to go up to 0.16 overnight, though).
   - for CHF, continue to follow pt
s fluid status and follow CXR
   - pt
s mixed venous O2 sat this morning: 60
   - will try to get more fluid off via CVVH (goal of at least 100 mL per
   hour) and titrate up levophed to keep MAP>60
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on AC with a PEEP of 8.  Plan was to
   wean from vent several days ago, but pt with copious white, frothy oral
   secretions c/w pulm edema, as seen with cxr as well.  So, plan changed
   to diurese approximately 1 L negative with lasix gtt.  Lasix gtt
   stopped [**1-13**] low BP
s but then was restarted yesterday.  Stopped again
   after it had no real effect on pt
s UOP.
   - pt failed RSBI several days ago
 will ultimately need to wean
   patient to PS and attempt another RSBI; however, the fluid removal via
   CVVH is more pressing at this time
   - pt started on CVVH yesterday
 671 mL fluid removed last night
   (between 7pm and midnight)
 will continue to monitor whether patient
   can tolerate CVVH
   - will attempt to increase fluid removal via CVVH and titrate pressors
   as needed to maintain MAP
   - If pt eventually ex extubated, will need to take care secondary to
   her transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to
   be careful when extubating.
   # Leukocytosis
   - no septic etiologies identified.  Pt was on empiric vanc/zosyn, but
   they were stopped yesterday.
   - Now, WBC up to 14.5.  Pt afebrile; however, CVVH will blunt the
   febrile response

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute-on-chronic renal failure. He was admitted to the MICU with shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. His mixed venous O2 saturation is 60%. He has been receiving fluids via CVVH and is being titrated on norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient's leukocytosis is not associated with any septic etiologies, and his Hct has improved to 26.6%. He also has transudative effusions, which are being monitored on serial chest X-rays. The patient's renal failure is likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion, and his diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin sliding scale and AccuChecks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to his CHF and decreased cardiac function. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and frothy oral secretions suggest a possible development of ARDS. This condition can worsen the patient's gas exchange and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute-on"

   - goal is to maximize fluid removal, titrating up levophed as needed to
   maintain fluid removal
   - If pt eventually extubated, will need to take care secondary to her
   transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.  Will need to be
   careful when extubating.

   - no septic etiologies identified previously.
   - pt had white count to 14.5 yesterday

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic stage IV renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's current medications include levophed for shock management and midazolam for sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, possibly due to his underlying CHF. Close monitoring of fluid status and chest X-ray (CXR) is recommended. Mixed venous O2 saturation should be obtained today to assess the effectiveness of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Levophed should be titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50, aiming for around 55.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8. He has had previous problems with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). The patient will eventually need to be weaned from mechanical ventilation and attempt another RSBI. However, fluid removal via CVVH is currently more pressing. If extubation occurs, care should be taken regarding secondary issues such as transudative pleural effusions and laryngeal edema.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count was elevated yesterday but has now decreased to 11.1. There are no identified septic etiologies previously. Preliminary sputum culture showed budding yeast, while blood and urine cultures are pending. Monitoring WBC levels is advised, considering that the patient will not mount a febrile response while on CVVH. Stool cultures should be sent if the patient clinically deteriorates or if the WBC re-elevates.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been fairly steady at 25.3. Continuing to trend the patient's Hct is recommended. Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) may be considered if necessary.

5. Transudative effusions: The patient has persistent transudative effusions. CVVH is being used to remove some fluid, and serial CXRs should be monitored.

6. Renal failure: The patient likely has renal failure secondary to decreased renal perfusion. Creatinine levels have improved today on CVVH.

7. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2): The patient's DM2 should be managed with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks. Due to the patient's high blood glucose levels, the insulin sliding scale should be increased.

8. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is difficult to assess due to sedation. Efforts should be made to wean off sedation if possible.

9. Fluid and electrolyte balance: The patient requires caution with intravenous fluids (IVF), replete electrolytes as needed, and total parenteral nutrition (TF). Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary.

10. Nutrition: The patient is receiving Nutren 2.0 (Full) at a rate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including vasopressors, antibiotics, sedatives, and analgesics. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, but with low oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate and tidal volume. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's abdomen is distended, and he has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition is complicated by hypothermia, cardiac shock, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Regular lung auscultation and weaning off the ventilator when possible should be considered.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic measures such as boot compression should be continued.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, and ongoing monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as melena or hematemesis, is essential.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the ICU with shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/46 to 122/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. He is receiving multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, calcium gluconate, norepinephrine, and potassium chloride.

Potential medical complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of congestive heart failure and current presentation suggest that he may be experiencing cardiogenic shock. This is supported by the low blood pressure and the need for vasopressor support with levophed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There is a concern for extubation failure due to previous problems with increased frothy secretions and failed spontaneous breathing trials.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an infection. Preliminary sputum culture grew budding yeast, and urine culture also grew yeast. Blood culture is pending.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple arteriovenous malformations. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been sedated and intubated, requiring mechanical ventilation. He is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has been on vasopressor support with norepinephrine.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of congestive heart failure and low ejection fraction (20%) increases the risk of cardiogenic shock. The presence of mixed venous oxygen saturation of 64% also suggests inadequate tissue perfusion.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. Previous attempts at extubation have been unsuccessful, indicating a high risk of respiratory failure upon extubation. The patient also has transudative pleural effusions, which may complicate extubation.

3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.7, indicating a possible infection. Preliminary sputum culture grew budding yeast, while urine culture also showed yeast growth. Blood culture results are pending. These findings suggest a potential fungal infection"

   is more pressing at this time
   - If pt eventually extubated, will need to take care secondary to her

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and use of vasopressors indicate cardiogenic shock. This can lead to poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. He has had previous difficulties with extubation and failed spontaneous breathing trials. Care must be taken when considering extubation to prevent further respiratory compromise.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and his current creatinine levels suggest acute-on-chronic renal failure. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the need for dialysis.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing fluid losses. This can result in anemia, hypotension, and further renal dysfunction.

5. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and positive sputum culture for budding yeast, indicating a possible infection. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent or manage sepsis.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute on chronic stage IV renal failure. He has had recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure support (PS) of 9-18. The patient has experienced significant volume loss from continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in the past few days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if he does not respond well to weaning off mechanical ventilation or if there is a failure in extubation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source and treat it appropriately.
3. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to his cardiac disease. Aggressive diuresis and titration of levophed will be continued to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is declining, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Monitoring of hemoglobin levels will be continued, and blood transfusions may be considered if the hemoglobin drops below 21"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/51 to 116/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient has atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (14.7 K/uL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, glucose of 173 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (Na+ of 135 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K+ of 5.2 mEq/L), hypocalcemia (Ca++ of 7.7 mg/dL), and hypomagnesemia (Mg++ of 1.6 mg/dL). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 433, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals significant edema in all four extremities, clear breath sounds in the anterior chest with decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung, and a tense abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is difficult to assess due to sedation.

The patient has multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleed, constipation, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory failure is due to previous unsuccessful extubation attempts and transudative pleural effusions. The patient's leukocytosis is stable without any septic etiologies identified. The patient's anemia is likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's transudative effusions are being managed with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's renal failure is likely due to decreased renal perfusion. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) is being managed with insulin sliding scale and blood glucose monitoring."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, and pantoprazole. 

Upon admission, the patient was sedated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The vital signs showed a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 108/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature was initially 37.4°C but later dropped to 35.7°C. 

The patient has been receiving various infusions such as midazolam, calcium gluconate, fentanyl, potassium chloride, and CRRT. Other medications include pantoprazole and fentanyl. The patient's weight is 100 kg, and he has significant edema in all four extremities. 

The flow sheet data indicates a fluid balance of -5,913 mL and a total in of 6,218 mL with a total out of 12,131 mL. The patient's urine output is 250 mL over 24 hours. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, low potassium level, and abnormal liver function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 100%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 433. 

The physical examination notes decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung, tense abdomen with bowel sounds present, and significant edema in all extremities. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleed, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, and several other conditions. 

ICU care includes nutrition through a feeding tube, glycemic control, and various lines and catheters for monitoring and treatment purposes. The patient is on full code status and the disposition is not mentioned in the progress note. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient may continue to experience bleeding, leading to further deterioration in hemodynamic status and potential need for transfusions.
2. Constipation/Ostipation: The patient may develop complications related to constipation, such as impaction or perforation.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may worsen, leading to pressure ulcers or infections.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status may continue to deteriorate, potentially resulting in delirium or other cognitive impairments.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may further deteriorate, leading to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Acute respiratory failure: The"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (h/o AVMs), currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, which can lead to cardiogenic shock due to impaired cardiac function.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PS (positive pressure ventilation). There have been previous problems with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed respiratory system assessment (RSBI). If the patient eventually gets extubated, there is a risk of transudative pleural effusions.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, but no septic etiologies have been identified so far. The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and will not be able to mount a febrile response. Preliminary sputum culture is inadequate, urine culture is pending, and blood culture is pending.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is declining slowly. The gastrointestinal tract is likely the source of the drop in hemoglobin (along with chronic kidney disease). Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy will continue, and the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, stage IV renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with respiratory failure and shock. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) 10/5. He has experienced significant volume loss due to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) in the past few days. The patient has had previous difficulties with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed respiratory system assessment (RSBI). 

The plan is to decrease ventilatory support to PS 8/5 today with the goal of extubation by tomorrow. Sedation will be decreased and changed to propofol. The patient's fluid status will be closely monitored, and aggressive diuresis will continue to remove volume with CVVH. Levophed will be titrated to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50. 

A family meeting is needed soon to discuss the patient's goals of care. The patient has leukocytosis but no septic etiologies identified previously. Blood cultures are pending. 

The patient also has anemia, transudative effusions, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to cardiogenic shock and chronic obstructive"

   failure.
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on PS [**9-18**] with good oxygenation and
   ventilation.  Significant volume loss with cvvh in past few days.  Pt
   has had problems with extubation previously, first [**1-13**] increased frothy
   secretions and also [**1-13**] to failed RSBI.
   - will try to decrease ventilatory support to PS 8/5 today with
   eventual goal of extubation by tomorrow.  RSBI 45 this AM.
   - decrease sedation
   - of note, pt has high chance of failure given his cardiac dz, but
   re-intubation may not be in his best interest.
   # Shock: - likely cardiogenic.  Pt is currently on levophed while being
   aggressively diuresed
   - continue to follow pt
s fluid status and CXR
   - removing 5+ L fluid removal with CVVH per day
   - continue CVVH fluid removal, titrating up levophed to keep MAP>50
   (try to keep around 55)
 goal is still to remove as much fluid as pt
   can tolerate
   - family meeting needed soon to discuss goals of care
   # Leukocytosis
   - no septic etiologies identified previously.
   - WBC stable
   - pt afebrile but will not be able to mount febrile response on CVVH

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is on partial support ventilation with a pressure support (PS) level of 9-18. His oxygenation and ventilation parameters are within normal limits.

The patient has experienced significant volume loss from continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in the past few days. There have been previous attempts at extubation, both of which were unsuccessful. The first attempt resulted in increased frothy secretions, while the second attempt led to failed respiratory system assessment with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 45.

The plan for today is to decrease ventilatory support to a PS level of 8/5 with the goal of extubation by tomorrow. Sedation will be decreased, and the patient's fluid status and chest X-ray will be closely monitored. CVVH fluid removal will continue, with titration of levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50. The target is to remove as much fluid as the patient can tolerate.

The patient also has leukocytosis, but no septic etiologies have been identified previously. Blood cultures are pending, and antibiotics will be withheld unless there"

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at PS 10/5, FiO2 30%, and PEEP 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high potassium level, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. The patient's liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are also abnormal.

The patient's recent events include a lengthy conversation with the daughter about the possibility of extubation failure and potential reintubation, being weaned off diuretics, and increasing the use of levophed to maintain blood pressure during CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and potential complications associated with prolonged intubation.

2. Acute Renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is on positive pressure ventilation with a pressure support (PS) of 10 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. He has good oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient previously had difficulties with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed respiratory system assessment (RSBI). The goal is to wean down the PS and potentially extubate the patient, but there is a high chance of failure considering his cardiac condition. Re-intubation may not be in his best interest, and a family meeting will be held to discuss the goals of care.

The patient is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to remove fluid and is on norepinephrine and calcium gluconate infusions to maintain blood pressure and electrolyte balance, respectively. His fluid status will be closely monitored, and fluid removal targets will be set. The patient's leukocytosis is stable, and he has yeast and Klebsiella pneumonia in his sputum culture. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels are declining, and he will"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on PS 10/5 with good oxygenation and
   ventilation.  Pt has had problems with extubation previously, first [**1-13**]
   increased frothy secretions and also [**1-13**] to failed RSBI.
   - sedation was weaned down yesterday and changed to propofol
   - pt tachypneic this am
 will go up on sedation
 will also increase
   PS as pt
s tachypnea is likely [**1-13**] some element of respiratory
   difficulty
   - eventual goal to wean vent and extubate, but high chance of failure
   [**1-13**] his cardiac dz, and re-intubation may not be in his best interest
   discussed this with family and they are not comfortable with extubating
   patient at this point
   - continue to remove fluid with CVVH, using pressors if necessary to
   maintain pressure
 I/O negative 2.2L yesterday
   - will slow down with CVVH fluid removal somewhat
 goal of negative 2
   L off today
   # Shock
 likely cardiogenic.  Pt on levophed and CVVH
   - continue to follow pt
s fluid status and CXR
   - continue CVVH fluid removal, titrating up levophed to keep MAP>50
   (try to keep around 55)
   - goal
 negative 2L again today
   # Leukocytosis
   - WBC still elevated at 14.2 but pretty stable at that level
   - pt afebrile but will not be able to mount febrile response on CVVH
   - urine cx growing out yeast; blood cx pending
   - sputum growing Klebsiella pneumo (susceptible to zosyn) and yeast
   - C.diff negative
   - reconsider restarting zosyn
   # Anemia
 Hct slowly declining
 today is 20.8
   - GI tract is likely source of pts Hct drop (along with CKD)
 will
   continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse one unit of blood today
   - continue to monitor Hct
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent
   - Pt is on CVVH to remove fluid
   - Continue to monitor effusions on serial CXR
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - Cr stable and WNL on CVVH
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks
   - blood sugars still high
   - will need to go up on insulin dosing today
   # Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, on TF at 35 ml/hr

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute-on-chronic stage IV renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a pressure support of 10 cmH2O and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His vital signs include a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 86/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated with propofol and receiving norepinephrine for hemodynamic support.

The patient has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). His current laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient also has leukocytosis, anemia, transudative effusions, and renal failure.

Plan:
1. Continue sedation with propofol to improve patient comfort and ventilation.
2. Increase pressure support to 15 cmH2O to address tachypnea and respiratory difficulty.
3. Reconsider restarting zosyn, an antibiotic,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the MICU with respiratory and cardiac failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 30%, and tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL. He is also on norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50 mmHg. The patient has a high chance of failure if extubated due to his cardiac disease, and re-intubation may not be in his best interest. The family is not comfortable with extubating the patient at this point.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a concern for recurrent respiratory failure if extubation fails. The patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy placement.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, as indicated by the need for vasopressor support with levophed to maintain MAP above 50 mmHg. Close monitoring of fluid status and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) will be necessary to manage the shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on PS 10/5 with good oxygenation and
   ventilation.  Pt has had problems with extubation previously, first [**1-13**]
   increased frothy secretions and also [**1-13**] to failed RSBI.
   - pt was tachypneic yesterday and was switched to AC
   - eventual goal to wean vent and extubate, but high chance of failure
   [**1-13**] his cardiac dz, and re-intubation may not be in his best interest
   discussed this with family and they are not comfortable with extubating
   patient at this point
   - continue to remove fluid with CVVH, using pressors if necessary to
   maintain pressure
 I/O negative 2.4L yesterday
   - goal of negative 2 L off today
   # Shock
 likely cardiogenic.  Pt on levophed and CVVH
   - continue to follow pt
s fluid status and CXR
   - continue CVVH fluid removal, titrating up levophed to keep MAP>50
   (try to keep around 55)
   - goal
 negative 2L again today
   # Leukocytosis
   - WBC elevated at 18.1 from 14.2 yesterday
   - pt afebrile but will not be able to mount febrile response on CVVH
   - urine cx from [**6-14**] growing out yeast; blood cx pending
   - sputum cx from 7/4growing Klebsiella pneumo (susceptible to zosyn)
   and yeast
   - Will send Blood/Urine/Sputum Cx today in light of rising white count
   and worsening respiratory status.
   - C.diff negative
   - Pt. on meropenem
   # Anemia
 Hct slowly declining
 today is 21.8
   - GI tract is likely source of pts Hct drop (along with CKD)
 will
   continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Given pace of Hct drop will need to transfuse additional unit today.
   - transfuse one unit of blood today
   - continue to monitor Hct
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent/worsening
   - Pt is on CVVH to remove fluid
   - Continue to monitor effusions on serial CXR
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - Cr stable and WNL on CVVH
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks
   - blood sugars still high
   - standing insulin was increased yesterday will continue to monitor.
   # Altered Mental Status

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal
   failure, recent GIB (h/o AVMs), in MICU with shock and respiratory
   failure.
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on PS 10/5 with good oxygenation and
   ventilation.  Pt has had problems with extubation previously, first [**1-13**]
   increased frothy secretions and also [**1-13**] to failed RSBI.
   - pt was tachypneic yesterday and was switched to AC
   - eventual goal to wean vent and extubate, but high chance of failure
   [**1-13**] his cardiac dz, and re-intubation may not be in his best interest
   discussed this with family and they are not comfortable with extubating
   patient at this point
   - continue to remove fluid with CVVH, using pressors if necessary to
   maintain pressure
 I/O negative 2.4L yesterday
   - goal of negative 2 L off today
   # Shock
 likely cardiogenic.  Pt on levophed and CVVH
   - continue to follow pt
s fluid status and CXR
   - continue CVVH fluid removal, titrating up levophed to keep MAP>50
   (try to keep around 55)
   - goal
 negative 2L again today
   # Leukocytosis
   - WBC elevated at 18.1 from 14.2 yesterday
   - pt afebrile but will not be able to mount febrile response on CVVH
   - urine cx from [**6-14**] growing out yeast; blood cx pending
   - sputum cx from 7/4growing Klebsiella pneumo (susceptible to zosyn)
   and yeast
   - Will send Blood/Urine/Sputum Cx today in light of rising white count
   and worsening respiratory status.
   - C.diff negative
   - Pt. on meropenem
   # Anemia
 Hct slowly declining
 today is 21.8
   - GI tract is likely source of pts Hct drop (along with CKD)
 will
   continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Given pace of Hct drop will need to transfuse additional unit today.
   - transfuse one unit of blood today
   - continue to monitor Hct
   # Transudative effusions
 persistent/worsening
   - Pt is on CVVH to remove fluid
   - Continue to monitor effusions on serial CXR
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - Cr stable and WNL on CVVH
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks
   - blood sugars still high
   - standing insulin was increased yesterday will continue to monitor.
   # Altered Mental Status
 difficult to assess [**1-13**] to patient being
   sedated
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, on TF at 35 ml/hr

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the MICU with respiratory and cardiac issues. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PS of 10/5, showing good oxygenation and ventilation. He has previously had problems with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed RSBI. The family does not want to extubate the patient at this point.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/45 to 109/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. His weight is currently 87.8 kg, down from 96.9 kg on admission.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 9,511 mL and output of 11,928 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,417 mL. The patient is receiving several medications, including albuterol, calcium gluconate, insulin, meropenem, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, potassium chloride, and propofol.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL, creatinine of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL. The respiratory system compliance is 35.7 mL/cmH2O, and the plateau pressure is 19 cmH2O. The patient's oxygenation is satisfactory with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 333.

The patient has been experiencing tachypnea and has had previous difficulties with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed respiratory system assessment (RSBI). The goal is to wean the patient off the ventilator and extubate him, but there is a high chance of failure due to his cardiac disease. Re-intubation may not be in his best interest, and the family is not comfortable with extubating the patient at this point.

The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, and he is being supported with levophed and continuous veno-ven"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple arteriovenous malformations. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation and ventilation. He is sedated and has a reduced level of consciousness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and is intubated on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about extubation due to previous failed attempts and the patient's cardiac disease.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, as indicated by the use of vasopressors (levophed) to maintain blood pressure and ongoing fluid removal via continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. Cultures have been sent, including sputum, blood, and stool, to identify the causative agent.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, suggesting anemia. The gastrointestinal tract is likely the source of the anemia, possibly due to chronic kidney disease.
5. Transudative Effusions: The patient has persistent and worsening transudative effusions, which may be secondary to fluid overload"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and stage IV renal failure. He was admitted to the MICU for shock and respiratory failure. The patient has had previous issues with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed respiratory system baseline index (RSBI). He is currently intubated and on pressure support with good oxygenation and ventilation. The family is not comfortable with extubating the patient at this time.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is in respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a high chance of failure in weaning off the ventilator due to his cardiac disease. Re-intubation may not be in his best interest.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, and he is being treated with levophed and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 18.1 from 14.2 yesterday. There is a concern for infection, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be sent today. The patient has a history of yeast infection in the urine and a Klebsiella pneumonia infection in the sputum.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is slowly declining. The gastrointestinal tract is likely the source of the drop in Hct,"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation and ventilation.
- He has had previous problems with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI).
- The patient is on levophed at 0.06 and propofol at 25 to maintain blood pressure and sedation.
- RSBI was 80 this morning, and the goal is to switch to pressure support (PS) today.
- The eventual goal is to wean off the ventilator and extubate the patient, but there is a high chance of failure due to his cardiac disease, and re-intubation may not be in his best interest.
- The family is not comfortable with extubating the patient at this point.
- The patient's fluid status will be monitored, and CVVH fluid removal will continue using pressors if necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >50.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.4, which is lower today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has been intubated and placed on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. He has had previous issues with extubation, including increased frothy secretions and failed rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). The healthcare team is attempting to switch to pressure support (PS) mode but recognizes the high chance of failure due to the patient's cardiac disease. Re-intubation may not be in the patient's best interest, as discussed with the family.

The patient's cardiac status is likely causing cardiogenic shock, and he is being supported with levophed and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The healthcare team plans to continue monitoring the patient's fluid status and chest X-ray, as well as titrating up levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50 (targeting around 55).

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.0, which is slightly lower than yesterday. Sput"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, stage IV chronic kidney disease, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple arteriovenous malformations. He is currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit for shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 99/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 490, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41.

The patient has several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hypothermia, cardiogenic shock, and leukocytosis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently in the MICU with respiratory failure and shock. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 99/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has mild inspiratory crackles in his lungs and a faint II/VI systolic murmur on cardiovascular examination. His abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-distended abdomen with bowel sounds present. There is significant less edema in his extremities compared to previously, with only 1+ edema currently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a high chance of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation. Surveillance cultures have been ordered to monitor for infection.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac dysfunction may lead to cardiogenic shock, as indicated by his low blood pressure and need for vasopressor support (Levophed). Close monitoring of fluid status and central venous pressure (CVP) is necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently admitted to the MICU with shock and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. His blood pressure is maintained with levophed and his sedation is managed with propofol.

The patient has a recent history of gastrointestinal bleeding, for which he received meropenem antibiotics. His leukocyte count is elevated at 15.0, likely due to the infection. The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL, which is most likely caused by chronic kidney disease and gastrointestinal bleeding. He has transudative effusions, likely secondary to fluid overload, and his renal function is impaired, likely due to decreased renal perfusion.

The patient's blood glucose levels remain high despite insulin therapy, so the Lantus dosage has been increased to 25 U daily. His mental status is altered, making it difficult to assess his level of consciousness.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is not responding to conventional treatments. His cardiac function is"

   Critical Care;
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3887**] appears to be hypovolemic after aggressive CVVH over past few
   days with CVP of 4, dry MM and improving skin turgor ( not as
   edematous). He remains on CPAP/ PSV but sedated with low dose propafol
   on account of cough.
   Bun/ Creat are 21/0.9 andHct is low at 23.4/ he is now on meropenem for
   VAP in addition to diflucan. Plans to address with family will be
   timing of trach/ PEG if they are agreeable since his wean will be
   prolonged on account of severe weakness that has compounded
   cardiopulmonary problems on the ventilator.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the MICU for shock and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation and ventilation. He is also on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation. There is a high chance of extubation failure due to his cardiac disease, and re-intubation may not be in his best interest. The goal is to wean off the vent and extubate, but it will depend on the patient's condition.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, indicated by the need for vasopressor support (Levophed) and CVVH. It is important to monitor fluid status and chest X-ray for any signs of improvement. The target mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained above 50, aiming for around 55.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.6. Although he is afebrile, the use of CVVH may prevent a febrile response. There is little evidence to suggest ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but surveillance"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate (HR) of 83 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 101/49 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on supplemental oxygen. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and tidal volume (Vt) of 439 mL.

The patient has a history of stage IV renal failure and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). His laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. He also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.9 K/uL.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild inspiratory crackles in the lungs, a faint II/VI systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation, soft and non-dist"

   85 yo M with h/o CHF (EF 20%), acute on chronic (stage IV) renal

   failure.
   # Respiratory failure
 intubated, on PS 10/5, with good oxygenation
   and ventilation.
   - approaching dry weight and markedly negative I/O via CVVH.
   - eventual goal to wean vent and extubate, but high chance of failure
   [**1-13**] his cardiac dz, and re-intubation may not be in his best interest
   discussed this with family and they are not comfortable with extubating
   patient at this point
   - continue with fluid removal via CVVH, keeping in mind that it may not
   be possible to remove as much fluid as we have been
   - will run cvvh even for now, to maintain adequate maps.
   - will check lactate as marker of tissue perfusion

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation and ventilation. He is also on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and vasopressor support with norepinephrine. The patient has leukocytosis, anemia, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may lead to further deterioration if not adequately supported with mechanical ventilation and oxygenation.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely suffering from cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed with appropriate hemodynamic support and treatment of underlying causes.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications and potential need for renal replacement therapy (RRT).
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB, which could contribute to his anemia. Re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He is also on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and receiving vasopressor support with levophed. The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, elevated white blood cell count, and anemia. There are also indications of constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypothermia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not properly managed.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not treated appropriately.
4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and positive sputum culture for pseudomonas/yeast, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. Additionally, there are pending cultures for blood and urine, which may reveal other sources of infection.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and ongoing blood loss could contribute to anemia and hypotension.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is being treated with medications including norepinephrine, pantoprazole, meropenem, insulin, and others. The patient has leukocytosis, anemia, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and altered mental status. He is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's likely cardiogenic shock can worsen, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may recur or worsen, leading to anemia and hypotension.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), or bloodstream infection.
6. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and stage IV renal failure, who presented to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and shock. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is currently on CVVHDF, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy, and is expected to undergo percutaneous endotracheal feeding (PEG) and tracheostomy tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure and is intubated. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), especially considering the prolonged duration of intubation.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely suffering from cardiogenic shock, which can lead to further deterioration in organ perfusion and function.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has pre-existing stage IV renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function due to decreased renal perfusion.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from a history of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers and infections.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to a combination of factors such as sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/52 to 121/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been intubated and placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His respiratory parameters show a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 59, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 403.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the right lung, peripheral edema, and well-perfused feet bilaterally. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels, and hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level"

Summary of Progress:
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation and ventilation.
- The patient's fluid status has improved, and they are off CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis).
- The patient's sedation medication, propofol, will be discontinued to improve patient sedation.
- The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock. They are on levophed and CVVH, and their fluid status and chest X-ray will be closely monitored.
- The patient has leukocytosis but is afebrile. There is no evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but sputum, urine, and blood cultures are pending. Meropenem will be continued for a total of 8 days.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has dropped to 22.8 today, likely due to the gastrointestinal tract being the source of blood loss along with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will be continued, and Hct will be monitored.
- The patient has acute renal failure secondary to decreased renal perfusion. Renal replacement therapy (RRT)-CVVH will be required after the placement of a percutaneous"

 intubated, on PS 10/5, with good oxygenation
   and ventilation.
   - approaching dry weight and markedly negative I/O via CVVH.
   - eventual goal to wean vent and extubate, but high chance of failure
   [**1-13**] his cardiac dz, and re-intubation may not be in his best interest
   discussed this with family and they are not comfortable with extubating
   patient at this point
   - will run cvvh even for now, to maintain adequate maps.
   - Plan for Trach/Peg early in the week.  Have spoken with [**Female First Name (un) 3880**] and
   she will consent for procedure.
   # Shock
 likely cardiogenic.  Pt on levophed and CVVH
   - continue to follow pt
s fluid status and CXR.  CXR slightly improved.
   - Use levophed to keep MAP>50 (try to keep around 55)
   # Leukocytosis
   - WBC lower today (at 13.6)

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, stage IV renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the MICU with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His cardiac function is compromised, and there is a concern about the potential failure of weaning him off the ventilator. The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis, anemia, transudative effusions, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has altered mental status, likely due to sedation. The patient is receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to manage his fluid status and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently supported by mechanical ventilation. However, there is a high chance of ventilator dependence due to his cardiac condition. If extubation fails, re-intubation may be necessary.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and high heart rate indicate cardiogenic shock. Levophed is being used to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP). Continuous monitoring of the patient's fluid status and chest X-ray will guide further management.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, indicating a possible infection. Surveillance cultures have been ordered, and meropenem therapy will continue until more culture"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-inch, 71.8 kg male admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is unknown, but there have been several significant events since admission. These include scheduling for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), increased insulin dosage, case management, intermittent requirement of levophed, initiation of midodrine, and plans to place a tunneled line by interventional radiology. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics without evidence of active infection. A non-contrast head CT showed no acute intracranial abnormalities, and the orogastric tube is properly positioned. An unsuccessful attempt was made at placing a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), and the patient will require interventional radiology assistance for this procedure.

The patient has allergies to Benadryl (Injection) (Diphenhydramine Hcl). The last dose of antibiotics, Meropenem, was administered on [**2110-6-24**] at 12:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min and lansoprazole (Prevacid) since [**2110-6-24**] at 08:00 AM. Other medications include unspecified ICU medications and changes to medical and family history.

Flow Sheet Data as of [**2110-6-25**] 07:02 AM:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.9°C (100.3°F), with a maximum temperature recorded at 37.9°C. The current temperature is 36.6°C (97.8°F). Heart rate (HR) is 85 bpm with a range of 80-92 bpm. Blood pressure (BP) is 107/53 mmHg with a range of 71-113/33-58 mmHg. Respiratory rate (RR) is 17 breaths per minute with a range of 15-28 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%. The patient is experiencing supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT).
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg with a range of 0-20 mmHg.
- Fluid balance: Total intake is 2,093 mL and total output is 2,429 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -336 mL.
- Respiratory support: The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 473 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen ("

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, acute on chronic stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple arteriovenous malformations. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with respiratory failure, shock, and other complications.

24-hour events include a scheduled tracheostomy/peg tube placement, increased insulin dosage, case management, intermittent requirement of levophed (a medication used to increase blood pressure), initiation of midodrine (a medication used to treat low blood pressure), plan to place a tunneled line by interventional radiology, and completion of a [Last Name] course without evidence of active infection.

The patient has allergies to Benadryl, confusion/delirium, and is on several medications including norepinephrine, lansoprazole, and others. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 107/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is also on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 30%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient also has a recent history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 

The patient is currently in the MICU with shock and respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is due to the recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy (TRACH) procedures. The patient's fluid status is being managed with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), which is also helping to remove excess fluid from the body. 

The patient's shock is likely cardiogenic, and the healthcare team is using levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50. The patient's leukocytosis is being monitored, as well as fevers, despite having CVVH. Blood cultures have been taken, and a chest X-ray (CXR) has shown some improvement. Stool culture and liver function tests (LFTs) are pending. 

The patient's anemia is due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and gastrointestinal bleeding. One unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) has been given, and the patient will be monitored. 

The patient has transudative effusions, which are being managed with CVVH. Renal failure is likely secondary"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/52 to 121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 51.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate, and lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolytes are slightly imbalanced, with low potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and calcium (Ca++) levels. The patient's albumin level is low, and liver enzymes are elevated.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and stage IV renal failure. He was admitted to the MICU for shock and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone multiple procedures including percutaneous tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion, tunnelled line placement, and a PICC line insertion.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/52 to 121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set ventilation volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 15.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 7.9 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 95 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) at 142 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 4.8 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 107 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) at 8.7 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 2.2 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) at 5.0 mg/dL, glucose at 167 mg/dL, and albumin at 2.6 g/dL.

The patient has several medical complications including anemia, gastrointestinal bleed, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and leukocytosis with fever. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to the recent tracheostomy and PEG insertion. The shock is likely cardiogenic in nature, and the patient's renal failure is likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion.

The patient's treatment plan includes initiating hemodialysis (HD) while maintaining adequate maps, trying tracheostomy mask today, monitoring results of blood cultures and chest X-ray (CXR), sending stool culture, and performing liver function tests (LFTs), amylase, and lipase. The patient is also being given midodrine to improve blood pressure and will continue peritoneal dialysis (PD) to remove excess fluid.

Overall, the patient's current condition is stable with improving mental status and resolving shock. However, the patient still requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, acute on chronic stage IV renal failure, recent gastrointestinal bleed, and multiple arteriovenous malformations. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He is also on hemodialysis to remove excess fluid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which requires ongoing support with a tracheostomy mask and intermittent pressure support. Monitoring and adjustment of ventilation parameters will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, as indicated by low mean arterial pressure (MAP) values. The goal is to achieve a MAP above 50. Increasing midodrine to 10 mg three times a day has been initiated to improve vascular tone and increase blood pressure.
3. Leukocytosis and Fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, but there is no evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) on the chest X-ray. Blood and sputum cultures have been completed, and results are pending. The elevated levels of liver enzymes could be attributed to the use of propofol earlier in the hospital course.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped, likely due to gastrointestinal blood"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU for shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and has had multiple interventions including hemodialysis, tracheostomy, and placement of an arterial line and PICC line. His recent blood cultures have shown no growth, indicating no bacterial infection. The patient's current conditions include anemia, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if there are any complications with the ventilator or if the underlying cause is not addressed properly.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen if his heart function does not improve or if there are further complications related to his congestive heart failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management of fluid and electrolytes is crucial.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding increases the risk of further bleeding or complications related to his gastrointestinal tract.
5. Infections: Although the blood cultures have shown no growth so far, there is still a risk of developing infections due to the invasive lines and procedures the patient has undergone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of confusion and delirium. The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He was started on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and given Cipro. The patient's vital signs show a low-grade fever, mild elevation in white blood cell count, and stable oxygen saturation. His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and he has a downward drifting hematocrit level. The patient has been placed on dialysis and has undergone a tracheostomy. He is also on lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's low hematocrit levels indicate possible ongoing bleeding. Further investigation is needed to determine the source and severity of the bleed.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin assessment was not done, which raises concerns about potential pressure ulcers or other skin integrity issues.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of poor perfusion suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, likely due to his pre-existing cardiovascular disease.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause"

   failure.
    # Respiratory failure
 S/P peg and trach
   - Pt now on HD to remove fluid. Will get HD today
   - Able to tolerate trach mask well. Continue trach mask with
   intermittent rest with pressure support
   # Shock
 likely cardiogenic.  Improving. Goal MAP > 50
   - Increased midodrine to 10 because MAP low 50s. Will monitor response
   # Leukocytosis  and fever
   - CXR not suggestive of VAP.
   - will monitor results of blood and sputum cultures.
   - LFTs, amylase, lipase not suggestive of etiology. Elevated levels
   could be [**1-13**] propofol use earlier in hospital course.
   - Pt was empirically started on Cipro for UTI (7day course) however all
   samples have been of poor quality because of minimal UOP and time
   needed to collect sufficient sample for analysis.
   - Urine culture pending
   - Consider d/c foley and in/out cath to minimize risk of UTI
   # Anemia
   - GI tract is likely source of pts Hct drop (along with CKD)
 will
   continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - HCT stable. Will monitor
    # Transudative effusions
 stable
   - Pt is on HD
   - Continue to monitor effusions on serial CXR
   # Renal failure
 likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion
   - Now on HD. Will get HD today
   # DM2
   - continue with insulin sliding scale and accuchecks
   - Basal insulin held yesterday because just restarting tube feeds.
   - Only got about 10 units Sliding scale and glucose adequately
   controlled.
   - Would continue SSI for now with no long acting insulin
    # Altered Mental Status
 pt off sedation and mental status improving
   # FEN: caution with IVF, replete electrolytes prn, on TF

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the MICU due to shock and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several interventions including percutaneous endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, and placement of a dialysis catheter. He is receiving supportive care for his various conditions, including fluid restriction, nutrition through enteral feeding, and glycemic control with insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy and is showing improvement. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which will need to be closely monitored. The patient's chest x-ray does not suggest VAP, but the healthcare team is waiting for blood and sputum culture results.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient likely has cardiogenic shock, possibly due to his pre-existing congestive heart failure. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50. The patient's response to midodrine, a medication used to increase blood pressure, will be monitored.

3. Leukocytosis and Fever: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and fever, which could indicate an infection. Blood and sputum cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism. Other laboratory tests"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, stage IV renal failure, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to shock and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications, including anemia, gastrointestinal bleed, constipation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, cardiogenic shock, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy mask. It is crucial to monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters regularly. Any deterioration in respiratory function may indicate the need for adjustments in ventilator settings or further interventions.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has evidence of cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to his underlying congestive heart failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is necessary. Inotropic support may be required to maintain adequate cardiac output.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to decreased renal perfusion. Hemodialysis (HD) has been initiated to remove excess fluid and manage renal failure. Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance is essential.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and it is important to monitor for any signs of ongoing bleeding. Gastric protection with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be continued to prevent further bleeding"
