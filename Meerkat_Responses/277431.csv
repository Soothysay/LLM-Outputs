   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - Will monitor hct q6 (pt also with autoimmune hemolytic anemia)
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse, contributing to dyspnea. He was extremely anxious overnight
   with concern that he may need to be re-intubated.
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole
   .
   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin
   - Transfuse to goal Hct ~25, nitrates / morphine PRN

   # Fever: Temp 100.5 overnight; Unknown how long patient has been
   afebrile but patient had a week of fever prior to admission and has
   been treated by MICU/BMT teams with broad coverage given
   immunosuppressed state. Flu swab negative, U/A negative, Urine
   Legionella negative and all blood cultures to date with no growth. CXR
   and CT with concern for pneumonia vs atelectasis.  All culture data
   since [**1-9**] has been negative and NGTD on [**1-17**] and [**1-17**] surveillence

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a left lower lobe lung mass.
- The patient presented with hemoptysis and underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from the thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe. The patient then underwent interventional radiology (IR) embolization of the bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been stable, and the medical team will continue to monitor it every six hours. If the Hct drops below 25, the patient may require a blood transfusion.
- The patient successfully extubated but is still experiencing respiratory distress due to the embolized left lower lobe and persistent right upper lobe collapse. The patient is stable on high-flow oxygen.
- The patient's fever persisted overnight with a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient had a week-long fever prior to admission and has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics by the MICU/BMT teams. Cultures have been negative so far, and the cause of the fever is still undetermined.
- The patient's creatinine level is very elevated at 1.5 today, which may be due to hypovolemia from massive blood loss or a possible underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Further evaluation is needed.
- The patient has"

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient successfully underwent extubation and is now stable on high flow oxygen. However, with the embolized LLL and persistent right upper lobe (RUL) collapse, this is contributing to dyspnea. The patient was extremely anxious overnight with concern that he may need to be reintubated. To manage this, the patient should be treated for anxiety as needed and continue treatment for pneumonia with Vancomycin (Vanc), Levoflox"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and presents with several potential medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is hemoptysis, which is likely secondary to a left lower lobe (LLL) mass and has undergone embolization. However, the patient does not appear to be experiencing further bleeding, with stable hematocrit levels and no additional hemoptysis.

The patient is also displaying signs of lower extremity (LE) weakness, with upgoing toes, decreased abdominal wall tone, and 3/5 strength in the LE. Neurological consultation has been requested, but the patient is currently too unstable for an MRI.

The patient is suffering from hypoxia and respiratory failure, with atelectasis, LLL infarction, possible pneumonia, residual hemorrhage, and some volume overload contributing to the condition. The plan includes gentle diuresis, chest physiotherapy, supplemental oxygen, and continued antibiotics.

Additionally, the patient has developed a fever, which could be related to the developing LLL infarction. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime, and the oncology team will be consulted regarding the discontinuation of voriconazole due to the patient's inability to take oral medications.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, and further evaluation of urine electrolytes and trends in creatinine levels will be necessary. Gentle diuresis will be continued, taking into consideration the patient's pulmonary status"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hemoptysis, likely secondary to a lung mass. They have undergone embolization and are currently stable with no further bleeding. The patient also presents with left lower extremity weakness, which will be evaluated by neurology. They are experiencing hypoxia, which is attributed to atelectasis, lung infarction, potential pneumonia, residual hemorrhage, and volume overload. The patient has a fever, which may be related to the lung infarction. They are also displaying signs of acute renal failure and diabetes. The patient's goals of care will be discussed with the primary team, as they are currently NPO due to mental status. The rest of the plan will be carried out as per Dr. [First Name (STitle) 575].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress indicate a high risk for respiratory failure due to atelectasis, lung infarction, potential pneumonia, residual hemorrhage, and volume overload.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient's left lower extremity weakness, upgoing toes, and decreased strength suggest the possibility of neurological complications. Further evaluation by neurology is recommended.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential acute renal failure. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and ongoing antibiotic use suggest a risk of infection, including pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   #LUL Mass- Differential includes CLL vs Renal cell carcinoma in order
   to determine treatment options; currently need a tissue diagnosis.  IP
   not comfortable repeating bronch in light of bleeding that occurred on
   previous bronch.  Options include VATS vs mediastinoscopy
   -Will need to discuss with thoracic surgery
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include
   pneumonia. Currently weaned down to 4L
   -Aggressive Chest PT
   -Continue nebs for bronchospasm
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole-plan for 8 day course
   #Lower extremity weakness- Initial concern for possible spinal artery
   emboli post procedure; consulted neuro who felt less likely and didn
   want to get MRI given pt would not tolerate it (cannot lie flat);
   however pts ability to move lower extremities has improved; may be due
   to sedation/meds that are now wearing off
   -Continue to monitor exam closely
   -Neuro following, appreciate recs
   .
   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin
   - Transfuse to goal Hct ~25, nitrates / morphine PRN
   ..
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr continues to be elevated 1.6 from 1.7 yesterday (baseline
   1.0-1.2); unclear etiology at this point but may be due to hypovolemia
   in setting of massive blood loss, however this is most likely cause.
   Given history of RCC however, this may also be contributing. FENA 2.7
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from
   baseline 28-30 with increased hyperbilirubinemia possibly related to
   hemolysis with elevated TB, low haptoglobin. Transfused 1 unit PRBCs in
   ED. Had responsded appropriate to transfusion, and hct stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and left lung mass, presenting with hemoptysis.
- The patient underwent bronchoscopy that was complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe (LLL). He then underwent interventional radiology (IR) embolization of the bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been stable post-procedure.
- The patient successfully underwent extubation and is currently stable on high-flow oxygen, but with embolized LLL and persistent right upper lobe (RUL) collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include pneumonia.
- The patient's lower extremity weakness has improved, possibly due to sedation/medications wearing off. Neurology is following up closely.
- The patient has profound anemia in the setting of CLL, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and recent large-volume bleed. ECG shows anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior leads. This likely represents a demand-related event and not platelet-related coronary thrombosis. Troponin levels are already decreasing despite worsening renal function, suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   #LUL Mass- Differential includes CLL vs Renal cell carcinoma in order
   to determine treatment options; currently need a tissue diagnosis.  IP
   not comfortable repeating bronch in light of bleeding that occurred on
   previous bronch.  Options include VATS vs mediastinoscopy
   -Will need to discuss with thoracic surgery
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include
   pneumonia. Currently weaned down to 4L
   -Aggressive Chest PT
   -Continue nebs for bronchospasm
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole-plan for 8 day course
   #Lower extremity weakness- Initial concern for possible spinal artery
   emboli post procedure; consulted neuro who felt less likely and didn
   want to get MRI given pt would not tolerate it (cannot lie flat);
   however pts ability to move lower extremities has improved; may be due
   to sedation/meds that are now wearing off
   -Continue to monitor exam closely
   -Neuro following, appreciate recs
   .
   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin
   - Transfuse to goal Hct ~25, nitrates / morphine PRN
   ..
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr continues to be elevated 1.6 from 1.7 yesterday (baseline
   1.0-1.2); unclear etiology at this point but may be due to hypovolemia
   in setting of massive blood loss, however this is most likely cause.
   Given history of RCC however, this may also be contributing. FENA 2.7
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from
   baseline 28-30 with increased hyperbilirubinemia possibly related to
   hemolysis with elevated TB, low haptoglobin. Transfused 1 unit PRBCs in
   ED. Had responsded appropriate to transfusion, and hct stable
   - serial HCTs q8
   - Iron studies c/w ACD

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a remote history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with hemoptysis and a lung mass. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which was complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe (LLL) of the lung. The patient then underwent interventional radiology (IR) embolization of the bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been stable.

The patient has several medical issues, including:

1. Hemoptysis: The patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the LLL lobe. He underwent IR embolization of the bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor. Currently, his Hct has been stable.

- Transfuse Hct < 25
- If the patient begins to have active bleeding, he will need to be intubated on the right mainstem given the site of bleed is on the left side; given high suspicion for metastatic renal cell cancer, however, options are limited if further bleeding develops. He will likely require thoracic surgery and IR.

2. Left Upper Lobe (LUL) Mass: The differential includes CLL vs RCC to determine treatment options. Currently, a tissue diagnosis is needed. Intraoperative pathology is not comfortable repeating bronchos"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presenting with hemoptysis. He underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe (LLL) of the lung, which was successfully managed with interventional radiology (IR) embolization of the bronchial artery and injection of alcohol into the tumor. The patient is currently stable with no ongoing bleeding.

The patient also has a left upper lobe (LUL) mass, and the differential diagnosis includes CLL versus renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A tissue diagnosis is needed to determine the appropriate treatment options. The patient's respiratory distress is being managed with aggressive chest physiotherapy, nebulizers for bronchospasm, and treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefepime, and voriconazole for an 8-day course.

The patient had a fall from bed, resulting in some bleeding from the lip but with a negative head CT scan. Neurological examination is stable, and repeat CT head is recommended if there are any changes in the neuro exam. The patient's lower extremity weakness may be due to sedation/medications that are now wearing off, and close monitoring of the exam is advised.

The patient has profound anemia in the setting of CLL, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and a recent large volume bleed"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   #LUL Mass- Differential includes CLL vs Renal cell carcinoma in order
   to determine treatment options; currently need a tissue diagnosis.  IP
   not comfortable repeating bronch in light of bleeding that occurred on
   previous bronch.  Options include VATS vs mediastinoscopy
   -Will need to discuss with thoracic surgery
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include
   pneumonia. Currently weaned down to 4L
   -Aggressive Chest PT
   -Continue nebs for bronchospasm
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole-plan for 8 day course

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   #LUL Mass- Differential includes CLL vs Renal cell carcinoma in order
   to determine treatment options; currently need a tissue diagnosis.  IP
   not comfortable repeating bronch in light of bleeding that occurred on
   previous bronch.  Options include VATS vs mediastinoscopy
   -Will need to discuss with thoracic surgery
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include
   pneumonia. Currently weaned down to 4L
   -Aggressive Chest PT
   -Continue nebs for bronchospasm
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole-plan for 8 day course
   #Lower extremity weakness- Initial concern for possible spinal artery
   emboli post procedure; consulted neuro who felt less likely and didn
   want to get MRI given pt would not tolerate it (cannot lie flat);
   however pts ability to move lower extremities has improved; may be due
   to sedation/meds that are now wearing off
   -Continue to monitor exam closely
   -Neuro following, appreciate recs
   .
   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin
   - Transfuse to goal Hct ~25, nitrates / morphine PRN
   ..
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr continues to be elevated 1.6 from 1.7 yesterday (baseline
   1.0-1.2); unclear etiology at this point but may be due to hypovolemia
   in setting of massive blood loss, however this is most likely cause.
   Given history of RCC however, this may also be contributing. FENA 2.7
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from
   baseline 28-30 with increased hyperbilirubinemia possibly related to
   hemolysis with elevated TB, low haptoglobin. Transfused 1 unit PRBCs in
   ED. Had responsded appropriate to transfusion, and hct stable
   - serial HCTs q8
   - Iron studies c/w ACD
   - GAS
   - resume Prednisone 5mg daily today now that tolerating PO
   .
   # CLL: Per oncology plan is to defer further treatment; oncologist Dr
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**] who is in touch w/family
   #HTN: Continue metoprolol as above
   .
   # AIHA: Prednisone 5mg daily
   # DM2:  Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] diabetes center following.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presents with hemoptysis. The patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe (LLL) of the lung, and subsequently underwent interventional radiology (IR) embolization of the bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate 91 bpm, blood pressure 128/62 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's recent labs show a hematocrit (Hct) level of 32.2%, leukocyte count of 3.8K/uL, platelet count of 42K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.6 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.06 ng/mL. The differential white blood cell count shows neutrophils at 83.1%, bands at 10.0%, lymphocytes at 9.3%, monocytes at 6.1%, eosinophils at 1.0%, and basophils at 0.4%. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3"
