   depression who presents with hypotension somnolence.
   # Hypotension: symptoms consistent with and likely due to Clonidine
   overdose  (bradycardia, hypotension and lethargy, miosis), doubt
   sepsis, PE, or MI (also mostly r/o in ED, not febrile, not tachy or
   resp distress, no signs of cardiac decompensation and secondary CHF).
   Could be due to bleed however pt brady cardic and somnolent.
   - narcane (for possible opioid overdose)
   - flumazenil (for possible benzo overdose)
   - pressors, preferebly levophed or dopamine
   - IVF
   - atropine for AV block, check EKG and atropine ready
   - activated charcoal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history of medication overdose with clonidine, repeat acute renal failure (ARF), recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) post bare metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), hypertension/hypotension, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) due to coronary artery disease (CAD) and substance abuse (alcohol/IVDU), and recurrent pulmonary emboli (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement.

The patient presents with hypotension and somnolence, which are consistent with clonidine overdose. Other possible etiologies for somnolence include opioid or benzodiazepine overdose. The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, most likely due to hypotension in the setting of medication overdose. Other potential causes such as sepsis or shock are less likely.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate (HR) of 61 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 101/45 mmHg to 60/38 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient is receiving various"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old homeless male with a history of medication overdose, acute renal failure, recent STEMI, hypertension/hypotension, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression.
- The patient presents with hypotension, somnolence, bradycardia, miosis, and lethargy, which are consistent with clonidine overdose.
- Other potential causes for hypotension have been ruled out, including sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction.
- The patient received activated charcoal for possible opioid overdose and flumazenil for possible benzodiazepine overdose.
- Atropine has been administered for AV block, and glucagon is available for suspected beta-blocker toxicity.
- The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely due to hypotension in the setting of medication overdose. Fluid challenge has improved renal function, and further monitoring and management of renal failure are planned.
- The patient has evidence of IVC filter blockage, but this is unlikely the cause of shock and acute renal failure. Heparin therapy will be considered once the patient is more stable.
- Transient hypoglycemia may be due to concomitant beta-blocker overdose, and the patient will be closely monitored for any further episodes.
- Anemia is likely due to a chronic gastrointestinal bleed, and ongoing monitoring and management are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of medication overdose with clonidine, repeat acute renal failure (ARF), recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), hypertension/hypotension, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. The patient presents with hypotension and somnolence.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been off pressors for 12 hours, and culture data is negative, making sepsis unlikely. However, close monitoring in the unit is recommended, and the central line should be kept until transfer to the floor.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are resolving, and the patient continues to diuresis. IV fluids should be held, and oral intake should be encouraged.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) with recurrent Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema with pain but no evidence of PE. Contacting the primary care physician regarding long-term anticoagulation therapy is advised.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is stable, and iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease (ACD). PM Hct should be checked.
5. Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COAD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the ICU with an altered mental status. He has a history of chronic anti-coagulation therapy and multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 126/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium for DVT, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. The patient's fluid balance is within normal limits, with a total input of 4,597 mL and total output of 2,785 mL. He is not receiving respiratory support. Lab results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Munchausen's syndrome: This refers to a psychological disorder where individuals fake illness or injury to gain attention or sympathy. It is important to closely monitor the patient's behavior and provide appropriate psychological support.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a past medical history of medication overdose, repeat acute renal failure (ARF), recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), hypertension/hypotension, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. He presents with hypotension, somnolence, bradycardia, and miosis, which are symptoms consistent with clonidine overdose. Other potential causes such as sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), or myocardial infarction have been ruled out. Activated charcoal was given for possible medication overdose, along with narcan for opioid overdose and flumazenil for benzodiazepine overdose. The patient's blood pressure is being weaned off from pressors, and atropine is ready for administration if needed due to bradycardia.

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, most likely due to hypotension during medication overdose. Fluid challenge has been given, and further evaluation of urine electrolytes and sediment is planned to check for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal consultation has been requested, and medications are being adjusted accordingly. 

There is evidence of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter blockage, but it is unlikely the cause of shock and acute renal failure. Chronic anticoagulation is being considered as an outpatient treatment."
