   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema, intubated for airway protection.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - change sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - consider ENT c/s for scope vs CT neck when ? ready for extubation to
   evaluate for lower airway edema
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation. Likely
   pre-renal in the setting of decreased PO intake yesterday. Improved to
   baseline of 1.6 after 1 L NS.
   - cont to monitor
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of acute
   renal failure felt to be pre-renal in etiology. Na trending up from 127
   to 133 this am. Recent baseline 137.
   - continue to follow sodium
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive, likely effect from propofol.
   - will add back HCTZ when BP allows
   # H/o seizures: continue dilantin

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN) who presents with angioedema. She was intubated for airway protection due to significant swelling of the tongue and facial edema. The precipitating factor for angioedema is unclear, but it may be related to stopping Lisinopril or exposure to levofloxacin. She also has a history of allergies to Bactrim.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. She is sedated and intubated.

Her lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, sodium of 133 mg/dL, potassium of 4.9 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, and glucose of 152 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has been started on IV steroids, benadryl, and Pepcid for angioedema. She is also receiving mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation with fentanyl/versed. The plan is to evaluate for lower airway edema when ready for extubation and consider an ENT consult for scope versus CT neck"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension presenting with angioedema. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Her allergies include Bactrim (oral), shellfish, and an unknown allergy. She has no history of hereditary or acquired angioedema. The patient's recent medications include lisinopril, which was stopped, and levofloxacin. Her laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels indicating acute on chronic kidney disease, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. She also has hypotension, but it is likely due to propofol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient's presentation of angioedema may lead to airway compromise, especially since she is already intubated. Close monitoring of her airway and respiratory status is necessary.

2. Acute on chronic kidney disease: The elevated creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, requiring careful monitoring and management.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels can cause neurological symptoms and should be closely monitored. Correction of sodium levels will depend on the underlying cause and severity.

4. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, it is important to continue monitoring her hemodynamic status, especially considering the use of vasod"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - change sedation to fentanyl/versed as will likely require intubation
   for at least 24 hours
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation. Likely
   pre-renal in the setting of decreased PO intake yesterday. Improved to
   baseline of 1.6 after 1 L NS.
   - cont to monitor
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of acute
   renal failure felt to be pre-renal in etiology. Na trending up from 127
   to 133 this am. Recent baseline 137.
   - continue to follow sodium
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive, likely effect from propofol.
   - will add back HCTZ when BP allows
   # Convulsive disorder: continue dilantin
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes prn, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension who presented with angioedema. The cause of the angioedema is unclear, but it may be related to lisinopril allergy or exposure to levofloxacin. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving intravenous corticosteroids and antihistamines. She is also on mechanical ventilation and will require intubation for at least 24 hours. There is no evidence of an infectious etiology, so antibiotics have been withheld.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema appears improved since arrival to the emergency department. She is being treated with intravenous solumedrol and benadryl. She will continue to be monitored closely.
2. Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine level was 1.9 on presentation but improved to baseline after receiving 1 liter of normal saline. The cause of acute kidney injury is likely pre-renal due to decreased oral intake. The patient will continue to be monitored for any changes in kidney function.
3. Left upper extremity swelling: Ultrasound did not reveal any deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The swelling will continue to be monitored.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely hypovolemic in nature"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - change sedation to fentanyl/versed as will likely require intubation
   for at least 24 hours
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation. Likely
   pre-renal in the setting of decreased PO intake yesterday. Improved to
   baseline of 1.6 after 1 L NS.
   - cont to monitor
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of acute
   renal failure felt to be pre-renal in etiology. Na trending up from 127
   to 133 this am. Recent baseline 137.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN) who presents with angioedema. The exact precipitating factor for the angioedema is unclear, but it may be related to the recent discontinuation of lisinopril, which was listed as an allergy for unknown reasons. Another possible trigger could be exposure to levofloxacin or a food allergy. The patient appears to have improved since arrival at the emergency department (ED) and has been intubated for airway protection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,520 mL and output of 2,546 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,026 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, including famotidine and heparin sodium.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and blood glucose levels. Kidney function tests indicate a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated but within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is angioedema, which is presumed to be secondary to ACE (presumably angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), unknown shellfish derivatives, and Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including midazolam (versed) at 4 mg/hour, fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, famotidine (pepcid) started on [**2145-5-15**] at 08:00 AM, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started on [**2145-5-15**] at 08:07 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C (99.8 F), heart rate of 67 bpm with a range of 58-89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/62 mmHg to 162/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a spontaneous rate of 0, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's flow sheet data shows fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance with no acute distress. The patient has normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, nasotracheal intubation, and subglottic/neck swelling. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with no murmurs. The respiratory/chest examination reveals clear breath sounds anteriorly. The abdominal examination is unremarkable, and the extremities show trace edema bilaterally. The neurologic examination indicates the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to noxious stimuli, and has no assessed movement or tone.

The patient's lab results include normal white blood cell count, elevated platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine level, low total carbon dioxide level, and elevated glucose level. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
The patient has angioedema presumed secondary to ACE inhibitors. The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to difficult nasotracheal intubation. The patient is on steroids and antihistamines. The patient requires careful airway management, and submandibular swelling has significantly reduced although throat edema/anterior neck edema remains impressive. The patient will require continued mechanical intubation for several days as the swelling subsides. A cuff leak can be checked as an initial marker for improvement. It is likely that a neck CT will be performed later in the week.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of acute renal failure, alteration in nutrition, and inability to protect own airway. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. 

On the 24-hour flow sheet, the patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/52 to 158/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on fentanyl and midazolam infusions.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 975 mL and output of 920 mL, resulting in a balance of 55 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 80 kg at admission to 69.6 kg currently.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine and blood glucose, along with slightly low potassium and sodium levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O.

Physical examination findings are not documented due to lack of assessment in the review of systems and physical examination sections.

The patient's current assessment includes ongoing renal failure, alteration"

   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. She presents with angioedema and was intubated for airway protection. The cause of angioedema is unclear, and it is uncertain whether her symptoms were triggered by lisinopril, levofloxacin, or a food allergy. The patient's condition appears to have improved since arrival at the emergency department.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/52 to 158/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and intubated, with mechanical ventilation in place. The patient has mild facial swelling and a prominent swollen tongue protruding from her mouth, which is significantly decreased from yesterday.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels are also elevated. Other lab values, including electrolytes and calcium, are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema may recur or worsen if the underlying cause is not identified and treated appropriately.
2. Airway Compromise: Due to the patient's intubation and the swollen"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with angioedema, likely secondary to medication (Levoquin or ACE) due to known allergies. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. They have been receiving various medications including Fentanyl, Midazolam, Heparin, and Famotidine. The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating but remains within normal limits. The patient has experienced an increase in yellowish secretions, and there has been some improvement in oral, submandibular, and neck swelling. The patient remains intubated due to difficult nasotracheal intubation and airway protection concerns. There are plans to assess the extent and severity of airway edema with a CT scan and develop a careful extubation plan. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's renal function tests show mild elevation in creatinine levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 975 mL and output of 920 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 55 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator set at"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5856**] is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD, HTN admitted
   with angioedema now intubated for airway protection with course
   complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema, also
   unlikely given patient
s age. Reportedly appears improved since arrival
   to the ED. Intubated for airway protection.
   - Continue  IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
   - Continue IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - Continue IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - Continue mechanical ventilation, RSBI 222 today.
   - Change sedation to propafol, wean as tolerated with possible SBT
   later today.
   - Check cuff leak.
   - When ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation now 1.8
   with baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8. FeNa 9.1 suggesting intra-renal
   pathology with no casts.  Patient does not appear to have had any
   hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast (CIN).
   - Trend creatinine
   - If creatinine does not improve, will check renal U/S and consult
   renal.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - Trend WBC
   .
   # Anemia: Stable hct.
   - Trend hct
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to follow sodium
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - Hold home HCTZ given resolving ARF
   .
   # H/o seizures: continue dilantin
   FEN: TF, replete as necessary
   Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ
   Access: PIV, midline

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN) admitted with angioedema, now intubated for airway protection.
- The patient's condition is complicated by acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient has been improving since arrival to the emergency department (ED).
- She was recently exposed to levofloxacin and had her lisinopril medication recently stopped, which may have contributed to the angioedema.
- The patient's angioedema appears to be improved since arrival in the ED.
- She is currently receiving IV solumedrol, IV benadryl, and IV pepcid for angioedema.
- She is also mechanically ventilated, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 222 today.
- Sedation is being changed to propofol, and the plan is to wean as tolerated with a possible spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) later today.
- The patient's cuff leak needs to be checked.
- When ready for extubation, anesthesia will be required at the bedside due to difficult intubation.
- There is no evidence to suggest an infectious etiology, so antibiotics are being held off.
- The patient has acute-on-chronic kidney disease, with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8 and a current creatinine of 1.8.
- Her fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 9.1, suggesting intra-renal pathology without casts.
- There is no evidence of hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).
- The plan is to trend creatinine and consult renal if it does not improve.
- The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to steroid administration, and will continue to monitor and reduce steroids.
- Her hemoglobin concentration (hct) is stable, and will continue to trend it.
- The patient has left upper extremity (LUE) swelling, but an ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- Her serum sodium level is now within normal limits, and the hyponatremia on admission was likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of ARF.
- The patient's hypertension is currently resolving, and she should continue to follow sodium levels.
- The patient has a history of seizures, and she is receiving dilantin.
- Prophylactic heparin is being administered subcutaneously.
- The patient's access line is midline, and her code status is full code.
- The patient's communication details are provided, and she is currently receiving ICU level of care.
- Her nutrition is being provided through Fibersource HN at 50 mL/hour.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 5856**] is a 72 year old female with
   dementia, CAD, HTN admitted with angioedema now intubated for airway
   protection with course complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - Continue  IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
   - Continue IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - Continue IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - Continue mechanical ventilation, RSBI 222 today.
   - Will check cuff leak when patient is tolerating PS trial. Consider
   ENT c/s for scope vs CT neck when ? ready for extubation to evaluate
   for lower airway edema.  W
   - When ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation now 1.8
   with baseline creatinine of ~1.5. FeNa 9.1 suggesting intra-renal
   pathology with no reported casts.  Patient does not appear to have had
   any hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast (CIN).
   - Trend creatinine
   - If creatinine does not improve, will check renal U/S and consult
   renal.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - Trend WBC
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to follow sodium
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - Hold home HCTZ given ARF

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted with angioedema and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient has a history of CAD, HTN, and an episode of seizures. She is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Angioedema: The patient's recent exposure to lisinopril and levofloxacin may have triggered the angioedema. It is important to continue IV solumedrol and benadryl to manage the symptoms.

2. Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine levels indicate a worsening of renal function. Trending creatinine and consulting renal services will help determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

3. Leukocytosis: The increasing WBC count may be due to steroid administration. Monitoring the WBC trend and reducing steroids if possible will be necessary.

4. Lower extremity swelling (LUE): Although an ultrasound ruled out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), continued monitoring is required to assess for any other vascular complications.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels have normalized, likely due to volume resuscitation. However, continued follow-up is needed to ensure sodium levels remain within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN) admitted to the ICU for angioedema. She is intubated for airway protection and has a history of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's fever overnight was 100.7 degrees Celsius, but she remains hemodynamically stable. Her lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, hyponatremia, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient also has a history of seizures, and she is on dilantin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infectious process. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and imaging studies will be necessary to identify and treat any potential infections promptly.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment. It is important to monitor renal function closely and adjust medication dosages accordingly. Fluid balance and electrolyte levels should also be monitored regularly.

3. Seizure Prophylaxis: The patient has a history of seizures, and she is currently on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. Monitoring for any signs of seizure activity or changes in mental status is crucial. Regular neurologic assessments should be performed.

4. Airway Management: The patient is intubated, so careful monitoring of respiratory status and airway patency is essential. Fre"

- The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN).
- She was admitted with angioedema and is now intubated for airway protection.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient's facial and neck swelling continues to improve, but she has a cuff leak and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) below 100.
- It is unclear what triggered the angioedema, but it may have been related to lisinopril or exposure to levofloxacin.
- The patient also has a history of allergies, including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim), shellfish, ace inhibitors, and levofloxacin.
- Fever: The patient had a temperature of 100.7°F overnight but is hemodynamically stable. Antibiotics have not been started.
- Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating intra-renal pathology. There are no casts present, suggesting that the cause is not acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).
- Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, which could be due to steroid administration or an infectious process.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN) admitted with angioedema. The patient was intubated for airway protection and developed acute renal failure (ARF) during her course in the ICU.

The patient's recent progress includes being successfully extubated yesterday, with stridor treated using heliox. The facial and neck swelling continues to improve, and the plan is to convert from prednisone to a short course taper. The patient's fever is stable overnight, and there are no signs of infection at this time. 

The patient's creatinine level has returned to baseline, indicating improvement in her acute on chronic kidney disease. Leukocytosis is stable, likely due to steroid administration. Anemia is stable with a normal hematocrit (Hct) level. Hyponatremia has resolved, and the patient is now within normal serum sodium levels. Hypertension is currently under control, and the home HCTZ medication is being held.

The patient's history of seizures is being managed with dilantin. Prophylactic measures include heparin sodium subcutaneously for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and midline intravenous access. Code status is full code, and the patient will be called out today.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially required intubation"

   with angioedema now intubated for airway protection with course
   complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Facial and neck swelling continues to improve. Patient
   extubated successfully yesterday with stridor noted several hours
   post-intubation treated with heliox.
   - Convert to prednisone 40 mg daily, plan for short course taper.
   - Convert benadryl to po prn
   - [**Last Name (un) **] famotidine to PO.
   .
   # Fever: Patient afebrile overnight.
   - Culture data NGTD
   - Would consider initiating antimicrobial therapy if patient becomes
   febrile.
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Creatinine now at baseline.
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Stable today, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u culture data
   .
   # Anemia: Stable hct.
   - Trend hct
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to trend sodium
