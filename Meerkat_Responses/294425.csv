   24 Hour Events:
   [**6-1**] Events:
   -tachypnea and wheezing with position changes to 40
s and 50
   Per previous MICU admission note:
   76 YO M w/history of parkinson's disease, COPD, afib, hearing loss,
   urinary retention w/indwelling foley, and recent admission for
   aspiration pneumonia admitted today w/complaint of worsening cough and
   low grade temp. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 19**] [**5-9**] - [**5-13**] and treated w/a
   2 week course of linezolid and zosyn which ended on [**5-23**]. Since then
   patient has had a worsening cough but reports no fever (NH reports temp
   - unclear how high). Patient denies SOB, chest pain, or any other
   symptoms. Patient given Vanco and Zosyn in ED.
   .
   In the emergency department he was found to have low grade temp - 100,
   100.2, tachycardic to 110, tachypnic to 40 and 93% on 3L. He was given
   vanc and zosyn as well as nebs in the ED and admitted to the medical
   floor. On the floor, he was being treated for viral pneumonia.
   Antibiotics were held and he was ordered for q6 nebs. He subsequently
   triggered this evening for tachypnea to the 40s, though has maintained
   his sats in the high 90s on 4L nasal cannula. ABG was 7.43/44/192. He
   was given solumedrol 125mg IV, zosyn, vanco, nebs x 2. Transfer to MICU
   was requested for closer monitoring.
   .
   On arrival to the MICU, the patient denies respiratory distress. Per
   report, he has been having diarrhea recently. His main concern is
   locating his call bell and having the light turned out. He denies LH,
   dizziness, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain.

   well as persistent moderate left pleural effusion and associated
   atelectasis remain. There is slightly improved aeration of the left
   upper lobe. The right lung remains clear. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is stable. Severe rightward scoliosis limits evaluation.
   Gas-filled loops of colon are again noted.
   IMPRESSION: Slightly improved aeration at the left lung apex with
   decreased pleural effusion. No definite evidence of pneumonia.
   .
   [**5-31**] CXR #2: difficult to interpret [**3-10**] marked elevation of L
   hemidiaphragm, no obvious significant change
   .
   [**5-31**] CT chest:
   1) Persisting dependent consolidation in the left lower lobe, likely
   from aspiration.
   2) Prominent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm without diaphragmatic
   defect.
   3) Two small 4- to 5-mm ground-glass nodules in the right middle lobe
   (3:32) which appear likely unchanged compared to the CT torso of
   [**2165-10-24**], however followup in one year by CT is recommended.
   4) Only partially imaged on today's study is a approximately 4 cm
   apparent cystic mass anterior to the IVC at the level of the filter
   placement. This lesion is not well characterized on this study, though
   is most suggestive of a GI duplication cyst. It has not changed
   significantly from the CT of [**2165-11-9**].
   6) 2 cm indeterminate left renal lesion which is not well characterized
   by non-contrast CT. Evaluation by MR is recommended if the patient is a
   potiental surgical candidate. Otherwise, a 6 month follow-up CT could
   be performed.
   7) Severe scoliosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. CXR difficult to
   interpret b/c of elevated hemidiaphragm.
   - Will stop vanco/zosyn and observe patient
   - will switch to prednisone 60mg PO daily x 5 day course
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps on previous ED and on the
   floor. Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley).
   Abdomen benign. Temp is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No
   skin lesions. CDiff possibility given recent Abx, although no Hx of
   diarrhea.
   - abx as above
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - remove foley, condom catheter
   # Tacycardia: Clinically dehydrated, BP stable. EKG shows sinus
   tachycardia (Hx of afib but sinus during last admission as well). Could
   also be due to low grade temp, anxiety, albuterol nebs. Received 1L
   IVF.
   - will bolus another 500cc NS now
   - continue to monitor
   - expect tachycardia to improve as pt's breathing stabilizes
   # UTI: cont cipro
   # parkinsons: continue current meds
   # COPD: continue nebulizers
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline, has Hx of GI bleeds
   - will guiac stools
   - follow Hct
   - type and screen sent
   # Afib: continue amiodarone, hold antiocoagulation as per Hx of GI
   bleeding.
   #. FEN: IVF as above, replete lytes prn, G tube feeds
   #. Access: PIV
   #. PPx: pneumoboots, SQH
   #. Code: full code, confirmed with patient and attempted to contact
   healthcare proxy.  Pt. clear he wishes to be intubated even if it means
   he may never wean off machine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hearing loss, urinary retention with an indwelling Foley catheter, and recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented with worsening cough and low-grade fever. He was treated with antibiotics in the emergency department and admitted to the medical floor. The patient subsequently developed tachypnea and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for closer monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, indicating possible respiratory distress or COPD exacerbation.
2. Low-grade fever: The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, which could be due to an underlying infection or urinary tract infection (UTI).
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be caused by dehydration, anxiety, or the use of albuterol nebs.
4. UTI: The patient has a history of urinary retention with an indwelling Foley catheter, increasing the risk of UTI.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is below normal, indicating a possible anemia.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to the recent aspiration pneumonia.
7. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia increases the risk of recurrence.

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hearing loss, urinary retention with an indwelling Foley catheter, and recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. He presents with worsening cough, low-grade fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient was initially treated with antibiotics and nebulizers in the emergency department and admitted to the medical floor for viral pneumonia. However, he triggered again this evening with tachypnea in the 40s and maintained high oxygen saturation on 4L nasal cannula. He received steroids, antibiotics, nebs x 2, and was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.

The patient denies respiratory distress and reports recent diarrhea. His main concern is locating his call bell and having the light turned out. He denies other symptoms such as dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Allergies include sulfa (sulfonamides), unknown allergies to hydantoins, trimethadione/paramethadione, phenacemide, barbiturates, primidone, and gadolinium-containing agents. The patient received prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 112/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,723 mL and output of 659 mL, with a total balance of 1,064 mL. Respiratory support includes high-flow nebulizers, and the patient's ABG results are 7.43/44/19.

Physical examination reveals a frail elderly male appearing anxious with a resting tremor. The patient has clear ocular movements and pupils, normal cardiac auscultation, and diffuse coarse breath sounds with wheezing and poor air movement, worse on the left side. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there are no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema in the extremities. The patient has contractures in the hands and feet.

   atelectasis remain. There is slightly improved aeration of the left
   upper lobe. The right lung remains clear. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is stable. Severe rightward scoliosis limits evaluation.
   Gas-filled loops of colon are again noted.
   IMPRESSION: Slightly improved aeration at the left lung apex with
   decreased pleural effusion. No definite evidence of pneumonia.
   .
   [**5-31**] CXR #2: my read: difficult to interpret [**3-10**] marked elevation of L
   hemidiaphragm, no obvious significant change
   .
   [**5-31**] CT chest:
   1) Persisting dependent consolidation in the left lower lobe, likely
   from aspiration.
   2) Prominent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm without diaphragmatic
   defect.
   3) Two small 4- to 5-mm ground-glass nodules in the right middle lobe
   (3:32) which appear likely unchanged compared to the CT torso of
   [**2165-10-24**], however followup in one year by CT is recommended.
   4) Only partially imaged on today's study is a approximately 4 cm
   apparent cystic mass anterior to the IVC at the level of the filter
   placement. This lesion is not well characterized on this study, though
   is most suggestive of a GI duplication cyst. It has not changed
   significantly from the CT of [**2165-11-9**].
   6) 2 cm indeterminate left renal lesion which is not well characterized
   by non-contrast CT. Evaluation by MR is recommended if the patient is a
   potiental surgical candidate. Otherwise, a 6 month follow-up CT could
   be performed.
   7) Severe scoliosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI. Completed
   14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. CXR difficult to interpret
   b/c of elevated hemidiaphragm.
   - continue vanco/zosyn, cipro
   - will switch to prednisone 60mg PO daily x 5 day course
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Fever: patient w/low grade temps on previous ED and on the floor.
   Possible sources lung vs urine (indwelling foley). Abdomen benign. Temp
   is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No skin lesions. CDiff
   possibility given recent Abx, although no Hx of diarrhea.
   - abx as above
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - foley changed
   # Tacycardia: Clinically dehydrated, BP stable. EKG shows sinus
   tachycardia (Hx of afib but sinus during last admission as well). Could
   also be due to low grade temp, anxiety, albuterol nebs. Received 1L
   IVF.
   - will bolus another 500cc NS now
   - continue to monitor
   - expect tachycardia to improve as pt's breathing stabilizes
   # UTI: cont cipro
   # parkinsons: continue current meds
   # COPD: continue nebulizers
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline, has Hx of GI bleeds
   - will guiac stools
   - follow Hct
   - type and screen sent
   # Afib: continue amiodarone, hold antiocoagulation as per Hx of GI
   bleeding.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hearing loss, urinary retention with an indwelling Foley catheter, and recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. He presented with worsening cough and low-grade fever. The patient was initially treated with antibiotics and nebulizers in the emergency department before being admitted to the medical floor. On the floor, he was being treated for viral pneumonia and his antibiotics were held. He subsequently triggered for tachypnea to the 40s but maintained his oxygen saturation in the high 90s on 4L nasal cannula. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 44, and PaO2 of 192. The patient received Solu-Medrol, Zosyn, Vancomycin, and nebulizers twice. A transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) was requested for closer monitoring due to his tachypnea and potential respiratory distress.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient denied respiratory distress and reported recent diarrhea. His main concern was locating his call bell and having the light turned out. He denied any other symptoms. The patient has multiple allergies, including sulfa (sulfonamides), hydantoins, trimethadione/paramethadione, phenacemide, barbiturates, prim"

   well as persistent moderate left pleural effusion and associated
   atelectasis remain. There is slightly improved aeration of the left
   upper lobe. The right lung remains clear. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is stable. Severe rightward scoliosis limits evaluation.
   Gas-filled loops of colon are again noted.
   IMPRESSION: Slightly improved aeration at the left lung apex with
   decreased pleural effusion. No definite evidence of pneumonia.

   [**5-31**] CXR #2: my read: difficult to interpret [**3-10**] marked elevation of L
   hemidiaphragm, no obvious significant change
   .
   [**5-31**] CT chest:
   1) Persisting dependent consolidation in the left lower lobe, likely
   from aspiration.
   2) Prominent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm without diaphragmatic
   defect.
   3) Two small 4- to 5-mm ground-glass nodules in the right middle lobe
   (3:32) which appear likely unchanged compared to the CT torso of
   [**2165-10-24**], however followup in one year by CT is recommended.
   4) Only partially imaged on today's study is a approximately 4 cm
   apparent cystic mass anterior to the IVC at the level of the filter
   placement. This lesion is not well characterized on this study, though
   is most suggestive of a GI duplication cyst. It has not changed
   significantly from the CT of [**2165-11-9**].
   6) 2 cm indeterminate left renal lesion which is not well characterized
   by non-contrast CT. Evaluation by MR is recommended if the patient is a
   potiental surgical candidate. Otherwise, a 6 month follow-up CT could
   be performed.
   7) Severe scoliosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI. Completed
   14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. CXR difficult to interpret
   b/c of elevated hemidiaphragm.
   - continue vanco/zosyn, cipro
   - will switch to prednisone 60mg PO daily x 5 day course
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Fever: patient w/low grade temps on previous ED and on the floor.
   Possible sources lung vs urine (indwelling foley). Abdomen benign. Temp
   is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No skin lesions. CDiff
   possibility given recent Abx, although no Hx of diarrhea.
   - abx as above
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - foley changed
   # Tacycardia: Clinically dehydrated, BP stable. EKG shows sinus
   tachycardia (Hx of afib but sinus during last admission as well). Could
   also be due to low grade temp, anxiety, albuterol nebs. Received 1L
   IVF.
   - will bolus another 500cc NS now
   - continue to monitor
   - expect tachycardia to improve as pt's breathing stabilizes
   # UTI: cont cipro
   # parkinsons: continue current meds
   # COPD: continue nebulizers
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline, has Hx of GI bleeds
   - will guiac stools
   - follow Hct

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, COPD, atrial fibrillation, hearing loss, urinary retention with an indwelling Foley catheter, and recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. He was admitted to the hospital with complaints of worsening cough and low-grade temperature. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and nebulizers but continues to experience tachypnea, diffuse wheezing, and poor air movement. His ABG results are within normal limits, and he is not hypoxic. The patient's recent imaging shows persistent consolidation in the left lower lobe, likely due to aspiration, as well as small ground-glass nodules in the right middle lobe. There is also a cystic mass anterior to the IVC, suggestive of a GI duplication cyst, and an indeterminate left renal lesion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's tachypnea, diffuse wheezing, and poor air movement indicate possible respiratory complications. Given his history of COPD, there is a risk of exacerbation or recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and continued use of nebulizers are recommended.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's low-grade temperature and indwelling Foley catheter increase the risk of UTI. Ciprofloxacin has been started empirically, and the Foley catheter should be changed.
3. Anemia: The"

   IMPRESSION: Slightly improved aeration at the left lung apex with
   decreased pleural effusion. No definite evidence of pneumonia.

   [**5-31**] CXR #2: difficult to interpret [**3-10**] marked elevation of L
   hemidiaphragm, no obvious significant change
   .
   [**5-31**] CT chest:
   1) Persisting dependent consolidation in the left lower lobe, likely
   from aspiration.
   2) Prominent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm without diaphragmatic
   defect.
   3) Two small 4- to 5-mm ground-glass nodules in the right middle lobe
   (3:32) which appear likely unchanged compared to the CT torso of
   [**2165-10-24**], however followup in one year by CT is recommended.
   4) Only partially imaged on today's study is a approximately 4 cm
   apparent cystic mass anterior to the IVC at the level of the filter
   placement. This lesion is not well characterized on this study, though
   is most suggestive of a GI duplication cyst. It has not changed
   significantly from the CT of [**2165-11-9**].
   6) 2 cm indeterminate left renal lesion which is not well characterized
   by non-contrast CT. Evaluation by MR is recommended if the patient is a
   potiental surgical candidate. Otherwise, a 6 month follow-up CT could
   be performed.
   7) Severe scoliosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. CXR difficult to
   interpret b/c of elevated hemidiaphragm.
   - Will stop vanco/zosyn and observe patient
   - will switch to prednisone 60mg PO daily x 5 day course
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps on previous ED and on the
   floor. Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley).
   Abdomen benign. Temp is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No
   skin lesions. CDiff possibility given recent Abx, although no Hx of
   diarrhea.
   - abx as above
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - remove foley, condom catheter
   # Tacycardia: Clinically dehydrated, BP stable. EKG shows sinus
   tachycardia (Hx of afib but sinus during last admission as well). Could
   also be due to low grade temp, anxiety, albuterol nebs. Received 1L
   IVF.
   - will bolus another 500cc NS now
   - continue to monitor
   - expect tachycardia to improve as pt's breathing stabilizes
   # UTI: cont cipro
   # parkinsons: continue current meds
   # COPD: continue nebulizers
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline, has Hx of GI bleeds
   - will guiac stools
   - follow Hct
   - type and screen sent
   # Afib: continue amiodarone, hold antiocoagulation as per Hx of GI
   bleeding.
   #. FEN: IVF as above, replete lytes prn, G tube feeds
   #. Access: PIV
   #. PPx: pneumoboots, SQH
   #. Code: full code, confirmed with patient and attempted to contact
   healthcare proxy.  Pt. clear he wishes to be intubated even if it means
   he may never wean off machine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hearing loss, urinary retention with an indwelling Foley catheter, and recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented with complaints of worsening cough and low-grade fever. 

Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient was found to have a low-grade temperature of 100-100.2°F, tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 3 liters of oxygen. Nebulizers were administered in the emergency department, and antibiotics (Vanco and Zosyn) were given. The patient was admitted to the medical floor and treated for viral pneumonia. Antibiotics were held, and nebs were ordered every 6 hours. 

However, the patient triggered tachypnea in the evening, reaching rates in the 40s, but maintained high 90s saturation on 4 liters of nasal cannula. An ABG showed pH 7.43, PCO2 26, and PO2 192. Solumedrol 125mg IV, Zosyn, Vanco, and nebs x 2 were given. The patient's condition prompted a transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, COPD, atrial fibrillation, hearing loss, urinary retention with an indwelling Foley catheter, and recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. He presents with worsening cough and low-grade fever. The patient was previously admitted to Hospital1 from [**5-9**] to [**5-13**] and treated with a 2-week course of linezolid and zosyn. Since then, he has had a worsening cough but reports no fever. He denies shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other symptoms. In the emergency department, he was found to have a low-grade temperature of 100-100.2°F, tachycardia to 110 bpm, tachypnea to 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 3L. He was given vancomycin and zosyn as well as nebs in the ED and admitted to the medical floor. On the floor, he was being treated for viral pneumonia. Antibiotics were held, and he was ordered for q6 nebs. He subsequently triggered this evening for tachypnea to the 40s, though he maintained his sats in the high 90s on 4L nasal cannula. An ABG showed pH 7.43, PCO2 44 mmHg, and PO2 192 mmHg. He was given solumedrol 125 mg IV, zosyn, vanco, nebs x 2. Transfer to MICU was requested for closer monitoring.

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. CXR difficult to
   interpret b/c of elevated hemidiaphragm. - will switch to prednisone
   60mg PO daily x 5 day course
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps on previous ED and on the
   floor. Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley).
   Abdomen benign. Temp is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No
   skin lesions. CDiff possibility given recent Abx, although no Hx of
   diarrhea.
   - abx as above
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - foley replaced
   # Tacycardia: Clinically dehydrated, BP stable. EKG shows sinus
   tachycardia (Hx of afib but sinus during last admission as well). Could
   also be due to low grade temp, anxiety, albuterol nebs. Received 1L
   IVF.
   - will bolus another 500cc NS now
   - continue to monitor
   - expect tachycardia to improve as pt's breathing stabilizes
   # Bradycardia:  Patient with sinus brady on ekg, no chest pain, trops
   negative.  Possible urinary retention/pharmacologic (cipro).
   - Cont. to monitor, EKG in AM.
   # UTI: cont cipro
   # parkinsons: continue current meds
   # COPD: continue nebulizers
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline, has Hx of GI bleeds
   - will guiac stools
   - follow Hct

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, COPD, chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and recent aspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted to the ICU from the floor with tachypnea. The patient has been on a 14-day course of linezolid/Zosyn and completed it one week ago. He is now being started on prednisone 60mg PO daily for 5 days. The patient's current medications include guaifenesin, standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6, and albuterol prn q2.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tachypnea: The patient has underlying COPD and is experiencing tachypnea with diffuse wheezing and poor air movement. This may be due to a COPD exacerbation or recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Further evaluation with ABG and sputum sample is recommended.

2. Low-grade Fever: The patient has had low-grade temperatures on previous occasions. This could be related to the lung, possibly aspiration pneumonia, or the indwelling Foley catheter. Further investigation with blood cultures, urine culture, and follow-up C. diff is advised.

3. Tachycardia: The patient is clinically dehydrated, with stable blood pressure. The EKG shows sinus tachycardia, which could be attributed to low-grade fever, anxiety, or albuter"

","Summary:
The patient is a frail elderly male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and malnutrition. He was admitted to the ICU due to a respiratory infection and sepsis. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and ongoing struggles with weaning off mechanical ventilation. He has had multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and Clostridium difficile colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently low, with an overnight bradycardia episode reaching as low as 38 beats per minute. This could potentially lead to inadequate cardiac output and organ perfusion.
2. Sepsis: The patient's recent positive MRSA screen and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection. If left untreated, this could progress to sepsis and septic shock, leading to multi-organ failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: Despite being extubated, the patient's respiratory effort remains compromised, as evidenced by his use of accessory muscles and decreased air movement. This puts him at risk for recurrent respiratory failure and the need for re-intubation.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest impaired kidney function. If not addressed, this could progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient had a confirmed full code status and tested positive for MRSA. He experienced mild hematuria, good urine output, and passing some clots after changing his foley catheter to a condom catheter. The patient's chest X-ray was unchanged but showed better aerated lungs. Overnight, the patient had bradycardia with a heart rate as low as 38 beats per minute.

The patient has multiple allergies to sulfa (sulfonamides), hydantoins, trimethadione/paramethadione, phenacemide, barbiturates, primidone, and gadolinium-containing agents. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin at 02:12 AM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 08:42 AM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lansoprazole (Prevacid), and other ICU medications.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 117/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received a total of 2,713 mL of fluids since midnight, with 1,440 mL given through the mouth, 1,073 mL through intravenous fluids, and 765 mL output via urine.

The patient's physical examination shows that he appears anxious with a resting tremor. His eyes are normal, pupils are equal and reactive, and his mouth is very dry. His cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The patient's chest examination indicates tachypnea and the use of accessory muscles to breathe, with diffuse coarse breath sounds and wheezing. The patient's abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with a PEG tube in place without any surrounding erythema. The patient has blood at the meatus and some clots in his urine after replacing the foley catheter. His extremities are cachectic with contractures of the hands and feet. His skin examination is unremarkable.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 139 mg/dL, potassium of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 169 mg/dL, and a troponin-T"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago.  Prednisone 60mg PO
   daily x 5 day course
   - Attempt to use BIPAP to assist with lung aeration
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps on previous ED and on the
   floor. Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley).
   Abdomen benign. Temp is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No
   skin lesions. C. Diff toxin positive.
   - abx as above along with addition of oral vancomycin.
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - foley replaced

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, COPD, chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and recent aspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted from the floor with tachypnea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 117/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient appears anxious and has a resting tremor. Physical examination reveals tachycardia, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The patient uses accessory muscles to breathe and has diffuse coarse breath sounds and wheezing, worse on the left side. Blood at the meatus is noted, and the patient has a Foley catheter in place with some clots in the urine. The patient also has contractures of the hands and feet.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 169 mg/dL, low hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, and slightly elevated potassium level of 4.9 mEq/L. The patient is positive for MRSA, C. difficile stool toxin, and GNR bacteria in the urine culture. Chest X-ray findings include persistent dependent consolidation in the left lower lobe likely from aspiration,"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. CXR difficult to
   interpret b/c of elevated hemidiaphragm. - will switch to prednisone
   60mg PO daily x 5 day course
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps on previous ED and on the
   floor. Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley).
   Abdomen benign. Temp is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No
   skin lesions. CDiff possibility given recent Abx, although no Hx of
   diarrhea.
   - abx as above
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - foley replaced
   # Tacycardia: Clinically dehydrated, BP stable. EKG shows sinus
   tachycardia (Hx of afib but sinus during last admission as well). Could
   also be due to low grade temp, anxiety, albuterol nebs. Received 1L
   IVF.
   - will bolus another 500cc NS now
   - continue to monitor
   - expect tachycardia to improve as pt's breathing stabilizes
   # Bradycardia:  Patient with sinus brady on ekg, no chest pain, trops

   4) Only partially imaged on today's study is a approximately 4 cm
   apparent cystic mass anterior to the IVC at the level of the filter
   placement. This lesion is not well characterized on this study, though
   is most suggestive of a GI duplication cyst. It has not changed
   significantly from the CT of [**2165-11-9**].
   6) 2 cm indeterminate left renal lesion which is not well characterized
   by non-contrast CT. Evaluation by MR is recommended if the patient is a
   potiental surgical candidate. Otherwise, a 6 month follow-up CT could
   be performed.
   7) Severe scoliosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago.  Prednisone 60mg PO
   daily x 5 day course
   - Attempt to use BIPAP to assist with lung aeration
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps on previous ED and on the
   floor. Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley).
   Abdomen benign. Temp is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No
   skin lesions. C. Diff toxin positive.
   - abx as above along with addition of oral vancomycin.
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - foley replaced
   # Tacycardia: Clinically dehydrated, BP stable. EKG shows sinus
   tachycardia (Hx of afib but sinus during last admission as well). Could
   also be due to low grade temp, anxiety, albuterol nebs. Received 1L
   IVF.
   - will bolus another 500cc NS now
   - continue to monitor
   - expect tachycardia to improve as pt's breathing stabilizes
   # Bradycardia:  Patient with sinus brady on ekg, no chest pain, trops
   negative.  Possible urinary retention/pharmacologic (cipro).
   - Cont. to monitor, EKG in AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea and is now on non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 65-79 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 151/67 to 158/77 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 17-28 inspirations per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 99%, and temperature within normal range.

The physical examination reveals a frail elderly male with a resting tremor, normal sinus rhythm, diffuse rhonchi in the chest, and cachectic appearance with contractures of the hands and feet.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 2.8 to 5.2 thousand/mm3, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) levels between 27.0% and 30.1%, normal platelet count (Plt) within 105-117 thousand/mm3, and elevated glucose levels between 139 and 180 mg/dL. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly trigerred by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. Initially treated
   with vanco/zosyn for? Pneumonia however d/c
d [**6-2**] as pneumonia thought
   to be unlikely. Prednisone 60mg PO daily x 5 day course for ? COPD
   exacerbation.
   - Attempt to use BIPAP to assist with lung aeration
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT if pt tolerates
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps in  ED and on the floor.
   Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley). Abdomen
   benign. Temp is low grade - possible pt w/viral etiology. No skin
   lesions. C. Diff toxin positive.
   - oral vancomycin.
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - follow-up c diff
   - sputum CX if able
   - foley replaced
   # Tacycardia: Clinically dehydrated, BP stable. EKG shows sinus
   tachycardia (Hx of afib but sinus during last admission as well). Could
   also be due to low grade temp, anxiety, albuterol nebs. Received 1L
   IVF.
   - will bolus another 500cc NS now
   - continue to monitor
   - expect tachycardia to improve as pt's breathing stabilizes
   # Bradycardia:  Patient with sinus brady on ekg, no chest pain, trops
   negative.  Possible urinary retention/pharmacologic (cipro). Resolved
   following placement of foley. Over last 24 hours HR 48-79.

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, COPD, chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and recent aspiration pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU due to tachypnea and is currently on non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has shown some potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient has underlying COPD, which can exacerbate and cause difficulty in breathing. The diffuse wheezing and poor air movement suggest a possible COPD exacerbation or recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
2. Low-grade Fever: The patient has had low-grade temperatures in the ED and on the floor. This could be due to a viral etiology or urinary tract infection, especially since the Foley catheter was replaced.
3. Bradycardia: The patient had sinus bradycardia on the EKG, which resolved after the placement of a Foley catheter. It is possible that the bradycardia was caused by urinary retention or pharmacologic effects.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be attributed to dehydration, anxiety, or the use of albuterol nebs.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is low, but stable. He has a history of GI bleeds.
6. UTI: The patient is currently on ciprofloxacin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent aspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted to the ICU with tachypnea, which is likely due to a COPD exacerbation or recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He has completed a 14-day course of antibiotics for pneumonia but was discontinued as the pneumonia was thought to be unlikely. The patient's tachypnea improved today.

The patient also had low-grade fever, which could be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or possibly Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He was treated with oral vancomycin for C. diff and ciprofloxacin for UTI. His heart rate initially was tachycardic but improved with intravenous fluids and then developed bradycardia in the 30s, which resolved after the placement of a foley catheter. His mentation remained intact throughout.

The patient's current medications include prednisone for COPD exacerbation, albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, guaifenesin, and oral vancomycin for C. diff. He has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, so anti-coagulation will be held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and recent aspiration pneumonia put him at risk for respiratory failure. He has diffuse wheezes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/44 mmHg to 158/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation using a Bipap mask and has been tolerating it well. The patient has allergies to sulfa, hydantoins, trimethadione/paramethadione, phenacemide, barbiturates, primidone, and gadolinium-containing agents.

Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, so there is no immediate concern for bradycardia.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's review of systems mentions no change in bowel habits, so diarrhea is not currently an issue.
3. Alteration in nutrition: The patient is receiving fiber source HN (full) at 60 mL/hour, indicating an attempt to provide adequate nutrition.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin status is not assessed, so it is unclear if there are any skin integrity issues.

   to be unlikely.  Tachypnea improved today.
   - continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily x 10 day course (day 5 of 10) for
   COPD exacerbation.
   - Attempt to use BIPAP to assist with lung aeration
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent aspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted to the ICU with tachypnea, which is likely due to a COPD exacerbation possibly triggered by unresolved pneumonia. Other potential medical complications that can arise include low-grade fever, bradycardia/tachycardia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently being treated with various medications such as Prednisone, albuterol, atrovent nebs, guaifenesin, oral vancomycin, and IV flagyl for Clostridium difficile infection, ciprofloxacin for UTI, and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, COPD, and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He was readmitted to the ICU for tachypnea, which is likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient has completed a 14-day course of antibiotics and is currently on Prednisone for the exacerbation. He is also receiving nebulizers with albuterol and atrovent, as well as guaifenesin. 

The patient had low-grade fever in the ED and on the floor, which may be related to a urinary tract infection (UTI). He tested positive for Clostridium difficile toxin, and oral vancomycin has been started. A urine culture is pending, and the Foley catheter will be replaced. 

The patient initially had tachycardia but developed bradycardia in the 30s, which was thought to be secondary to urinary retention or medication (ciprofloxacin). After the placement of a Foley catheter, the heart rate returned to normal. 

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, so anti-coagulation has been held. His Hct levels are stable, and he has a history of anemia. 

Nutrition is being provided through a feeding tube, and glycemic control is being monitored. Prophylaxis measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He was readmitted to the ICU for tachypnea. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 56 bpm (with sinus bradycardia), blood pressure ranging from 122/51 mmHg to 158/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool face tent with CPAP/PSV ventilation and FiO2 of 30%. The patient is tolerating the face tent at 30% with 15L flow, and chest PT and nebs seem beneficial.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient's main complaint is tachypnea, which is likely due to an exacerbation of COPD. It could also be triggered by unresolved pneumonia or viral upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient is currently receiving treatment for COPD exacerbation, including prednisone, albuterol and atrovent nebs, guaifenesin, and chest PT.

2. Low-Grade Fever: The patient has had low-grade temperatures in the emergency department and on the floor. Possible sources include lung infection or indwelling Foley catheter. The"

   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly triggered by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. Initially treated
   with vanco/zosyn for? pneumonia however d/c
d [**6-2**] as pneumonia thought
   to be unlikely.  Tachypnea improved today.  Awaiting placement
   - continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily x 10 day course (day 6 of 10) for
   COPD exacerbation.
   - Attempt to use BIPAP to assist with lung aeration
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able

   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - sputum cx if able
   - foley replaced
   # Tacycardia/Bradycardia: Initally tachycardic on admission. Improved
   with IVF. On [**6-2**] developed bradycardia into the 30s. EKG showed sinus

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent aspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted to the ICU from the floor with tachypnea, which is likely due to a COPD exacerbation possibly triggered by unresolved pneumonia or viral upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure and normal oxygen saturation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with BiPAP to assist with lung aeration. 

Laboratory results indicate a falling hematocrit level, from 30.2 to 26.4, without any obvious bleeding source. His white blood cell count is within normal limits. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are mostly within normal range. Troponin-T levels are negative, indicating no cardiac damage.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Tachypnea: The patient's tachypnea has improved today, suggesting that the COPD exacerbation may be resolving. However, further evaluation is needed to rule out recurrent aspiration pneumonia or viral URI. The plan includes continuing Prednisone, using BiPAP, administering albuterol and atrovent nebs q6, and obtaining a sputum sample if the patient is able.

2. Falling Hct: The patient's hematocrit level has decreased from 30.2 to 26.4. There is no obvious"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/ parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly triggered by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. Initially treated
   with vanco/zosyn for? pneumonia however d/c
d [**6-2**] as pneumonia thought
   to be unlikely.  Tachypnea improved today.  Awaiting placement
   - continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily x 10 day course (day 6 of 10) for
   COPD exacerbation.
   - Attempt to use BIPAP to assist with lung aeration
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT
   # Falling Hct:  No obvious bleeding source, from 30 to 26, low normal
   baseline, will continue to monitor and guiaic all stools
   - F/U [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - guiaic all stools
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps in  ED and on the floor.
   Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley). Abdomen
   benign. No skin lesions. C. Diff toxin positive. Afebrile x 72 hours.
   - oral vancomycin and IV flagyl for c. diff
   - cipro for UTI- 7 day course ( day one = [**5-31**])
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - sputum cx if able
   - foley replaced
   # Tacycardia/Bradycardia: Initally tachycardic on admission. Improved
   with IVF. On [**6-2**] developed bradycardia into the 30s. EKG showed sinus
   brady. No CP. Trops negative. Mentating throughout. Thought possibly to
   be secondary to urinary retention/pharmacologic (cipro). Resolved
   following placement of foley.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic indwelling Foley catheter.
- He was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, which improved today.
- The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia but currently has no signs of infection.
- He is awaiting placement and continues to receive treatment for COPD exacerbation.
- The patient's hematocrit levels have been slightly falling overnight.
- Other medical issues include low-grade fever, falling hematocrit, bradycardia, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to the recent aspiration pneumonia and triggers such as unresolved pneumonia or viral upper respiratory infection (URI).
2. Recurrent Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of chronic indwelling Foley catheter and recent aspiration event, there is a risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
3. UTI: The patient has been diagnosed with a UTI, which may lead to complications if not adequately treated.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have been falling, indicating a possible development of anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia, which resolved after the placement of a Foley catheter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a chronic indwelling Foley catheter.
- He was readmitted from the floor with tachypnea, which has since improved. The cause of tachypnea is still under investigation, with possible diagnoses including COPD exacerbation, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or a viral upper respiratory infection (URI).
- The patient completed a 14-day course of antibiotics for pneumonia but was taken off them as the pneumonia was deemed unlikely.
- He is currently being treated for a COPD exacerbation with oral prednisone and nebulized bronchodilators.
- The patient has a low-grade fever, which is likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) rather than the lungs. He has been afebrile for the past 72 hours.
- He has Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, for which he is receiving oral vancomycin and intravenous (IV) metronidazole.
- The patient's heart rate has been fluctuating between tachycardia and bradycardia, but now appears to be stable.
- His anemia is stable and does not require intervention at this time.
- His atrial fibrillation is being managed with amiodarone, and anti-coagulation has been held due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen, leading to increased shortness of breath, decreased oxygenation, and potentially respiratory failure.
2. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: The patient may develop another episode of aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. UTI: The patient may develop a new or resistant urinary tract infection, which can lead to systemic infection, fever, and potential sepsis.
4. C. diff colitis: The patient's C. diff infection could worsen, leading to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and potentially toxic megacolon.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's fluctuating heart rate and history of atrial fibrillation increase the risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or atrial flutter.

The Answer is: These are the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a frail elderly male with a resting tremor. He has diffuse rhonchi in the chest, worse on the left side, and contractures of the hands and feet. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/62 to 149/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 763 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 13 cmH2O, and a spontaneous respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count within normal range, hematocrit (Hct) slightly falling overnight, platelet count within normal range, creatinine (Cr) levels within normal range, troponin-T levels below the detection limit, and glucose levels elevated. Other lab results, including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are also provided.

Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly below the normal range, which can indicate bradycardia."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 76 YO M w/ parkinsons, COPD, chronic indwelling foley,
   and recent aspiration pneumonia here re-admitted [**6-1**] from floor with
   tachypnea.
   # Tachypnea: Patient with underlying COPD. Not hypoxic but diffusely
   wheezy with poor air movement. ABG initially was reassuring with no
   evidence of hypoxia.  Likely COPD exacerbation, possibly triggered by
   unresolved pna though with decreased cough, normal WBC, and no outright
   fever, unlikely. Possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, or viral URI.
   Completed 14d course of linezolid/zosyn 1 week ago. Initially treated
   with vanco/zosyn for? pneumonia however d/c
d [**6-2**] as pneumonia thought
   to be unlikely.  Tachypnea improved today.  Awaiting placement
   - continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily x 10 day course (day 6 of 10) for
   COPD exacerbation.
   - Attempt to use BIPAP to assist with lung aeration
   - standing albuterol and atrovent nebs q6 with albuterol prn q2
   - continue guiafenesin
   - sputum sample if patient able
   - chest PT
   # Falling Hct:  No obvious bleeding source, from 30 to 26, low normal
   baseline, will continue to monitor and guiaic all stools
   - F/U [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - guiaic all stools
   # Low grade Fever: patient w/low grade temps in  ED and on the floor.
   Possible sources lung, however likely urine (indwelling foley). Abdomen
   benign. No skin lesions. C. Diff toxin positive. Afebrile x 72 hours.
   - oral vancomycin and IV flagyl for c. diff
   - cipro for UTI- 7 day course ( day one = [**5-31**])
   - follow-up blood cx, urine culture
   - sputum cx if able
   - foley replaced
   # Tacycardia/Bradycardia: Initally tachycardic on admission. Improved
   with IVF. On [**6-2**] developed bradycardia into the 30s. EKG showed sinus
   brady. No CP. Trops negative. Mentating throughout. Thought possibly to
   be secondary to urinary retention/pharmacologic (cipro). Resolved
   following placement of foley.
   - Cont. to monitor
   # UTI: cont cipro
   # Parkinsons: continue current meds
   # COPD: continue nebulizers
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline, has Hx of GI bleeds
   - Hct stable
   # Afib: continue amiodarone, hold antiocoagulation as per Hx of GI
   bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent aspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted to the ICU from the floor due to tachypnea, which improved today. The patient is awaiting placement and continues to receive treatment for COPD exacerbation, possible recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and viral upper respiratory infection (URI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen, leading to increased shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing another episode of aspiration pneumonia, especially if he has difficulty swallowing or if his protective airway reflexes are compromised.
3. UTI: The patient has a long-term indwelling Foley catheter, which increases the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has a positive C. difficile toxin, indicating a possible infection caused by Clostridium difficile bacteria.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are falling, suggesting potential blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells.
6. Bradycardia/Tachycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia (slow heart rate) and tachycardia (fast heart rate), which need to be monitored and managed appropriately.
7. GI Bleeding"
