   Assessment and Plan
   #) Hypoxia: A-a gradient = 587 on 100% FiO2, indicating severe
   hypoxemia. Several posible explanations: Infection most likely, given
   fever and productive cough in a susceptible host, with a CT scan
   demonstrating scattered GGOs and areas of nodularity in both lung
   fields. This pattern suggests an atypical etiology (virus, mycoplasma,
   chlamydia), although the patient should receive empiric abx coverage
   for typical agents as well. Legionella ruled out by negative urinary
   antigen. PCP unlikely, given [**Name9 (PRE) 11734**] LDH and current ppx regimen.
   Infection superimposed on underlying lung disease (e.g. pulmonary
   hypertension [**1-18**] untreated OSA) might account for why the patient's
   hypoxia appears out of proportion to the findings on CT. At baseline,
   pt's room air O2 sat is in low-to-mid 90s. Possible, though less
   likely, that the patient has an intracardiac shunt (e.g. PFO)
   contributing to hypoxia in the setting of increased R-sided pressures
   from infection-driven hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction, which may be
   reflected in the RV strain pattern on EKG. No evidence of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure on ABG. PE ruled out by the CT angiogram. Patient
   has no prior history or exam/imaging findings to support diagnosis of
   CHF or COPD exacerbation.
   -Attempt to lower FiO2 via Venti [**Month/Day (2) **]
   -Consider a trial of [**Month/Day (2) **] ventilation if O2 Sat < 90% on non rebreather
   -Vancomycin 1g IV Q12H (Day 1 is [**2-14**]) for Gram positive coverage
   -Aztreonam 1000 mg IV Q12H (Day 1 is [**2-14**]) for Gram negative coverage,
   given allergy to cephalosporins and quinolones
   -Doxycycline
   -f/u blood cultures, CMV viral load
   -f/u Viral DFA panel
   -Sputum culture and gram stain, including fungal cx and PCP stain
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] Echo with bubble study to r/o intracardiac shunt/PFO
   -TMP-SMX 1 Tab DS Daily for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 11735**] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]>100.4 --> repeat blood and urine cx
   #) Hypotension: Initially concerning for sepsis but more likely [**1-18**]
   dehydration from poor PO intake, given improvement with 2L NS. Also
   possible that patient's underlying steroid-induced adrenal
   insufficiency, diagnosed by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim testing on last admission, is a
   contributing factor.
   -Continue stress-dose steroids: Methylprednisolone Sodium Succ 100 mg
   IV Q8H
   -75cc/hr NS for maintenance, given poor PO intake
   -Infectious work-up, as above
   #) EKG Changes: The ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions
   concerning for demand ischemia in setting of infection, but the
   ST-segment changes appear to be an exaggeration of a baseline
   abnormality, and the patient ruled out for MI with 3 sets of negative
   cardiac enzymes. The persistent T-wave inversions may be non-specific.
   The S1Q3T3 pattern apparent on the initial EKG from today suggests
   R-heart strain, possibly [**1-18**] increased pulmonary vascular resistance
   from hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction, although the strain pattern was
   less evident on repeat EKG.
   -Hold ASA for thrombocytopenia
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plt count 140s on admission, then 113 last night,
   down from 220s in [**12-26**]. Plt count stable in 110s this morning. Most
   likely explanation is medication side effect, as both sulfa drugs and
   vancomycin can cause thrombocytopenia. Another possible explanation is
   HIT Type 1, although the patient's plt count was down from baseline
   prior to administration of subcutaneous heparin on the floor. ITP
   always possible, though this would be a diagnosis of exclusion.
   -Trend plt count
   -Continue subcutaneous heparin for DVT ppx unless plt<100
   #) DM2: Steroid-induced. Pt has been maintaining BS in 130s with 12
   units NPH in AM. No PO intake in past three days. Inpatient BS are
   170s-180s despite poor PO intake [**1-18**] stress-dose steroids.
   -Continue 12 units NPH QAM
   -Insulin Sliding Scale PRN
   #) BMT/GVHD: Stable. No evidence that GVHD is contributing to the
   patient's lung process.
   -Continue steroids (home dose of prednisone replaced by stress dose
   steroids in inpt setting, see above)
   -TMP-SMX 1 Tab DS Daily for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], as above
   -Continue Acyclovir for Herpes ppx
   -Continue Folic Acid 1mg daily
   -Vitamin D 400 units PO daily
   #) [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine 1.5 on admission, up from baseline of 0.9-1.0, with
   return to baseline following 2L NS, suggesting a pre-renal picture. Pt
   received contrast load in EW for CT angio, though this was preceded by
   the 2L NS, and pt's current lab values are not concerning for a
   contrast-induced ATN.
   -Trend creatinine
   #) Nausea: Pt has 3-month hx of nausea/vomiting. GI work-up was
   essentially unrevealing. Barium swallow indicated mild esophagitis. EGD
   noted small hiatal hernia; biopsies were negative. H pylori studies
   were negative. Gastric emptying studying was normal. Hospital admission
   in [**12-26**] for this CC concluded that DDX included GERD vs adrenal
   insufficiency.
   -Continue Pantoprazole 40mg PO Q12H for GERD
   -Continue Budesonide 3mg PO TID
   -Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H PRN for nausea
   -Start bowel regimen: Colace + Senna
   #) Headache: Improved with pain medication. Pt is somnolent but has
   normal mental status otherwise. Concern is for meningeal infection,
   though pt has no focal neuro deficits or meningeal signs on exam.
   -Low threshhold for LP if meningeal signs or neuro deficit develops,
   headache becomes unresponsive to pain meds
   -Acetaminophen PRN for pain
   #) Neuropathic pain: Stable. Continue at-home pain med regimen.
   -Oxycodone SR PO 60mg [**Hospital1 **], 20mg Q2PM
   -Hydromorphone 2-4mg PO Q6H PRN for pain
   #) FEN:
   -Replete electrolytes
   -Diabetic diet as tolerated
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin for DVT
   #) Access: 2 peripheral IVs

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and status post allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) to the skin and liver. The patient is currently presenting with hypoxia, fever, and hypotension following 2 days of productive cough and lethargy.

The patient's oxygen saturation (O2 sat) dropped to 85% on room air, 88% on 6 liters nasal cannula (NC), and 88% on 35% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) via ventillator. The patient was switched back to a non-rebreather mask. The patient remained afebrile overnight and was started on maintenance fluids, as well as bolused with 1 liter of normal saline (NS), and remained hemodynamically stable. The second and third cardiac enzymes were negative.

The patient reports feeling much better in the morning, although they woke up drenched in sweat. They continue to have a productive cough but deny dyspnea, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, palpitations, or chronic left upper extremity pain, which is well-controlled.

On examination, the patient appears less somnolent than the previous night, is easily arousable, and appropriately interactive. They are oriented x3, with no acute distress or increased respiratory effort. The patient has sclera anicteric,"

   55yM with a history of AML, s/p allogenic BMT in [**6-22**] complicated by
   severe GVHD to skin and liver, on steroids, presenting from oncology
   clinic with profound hypoxia, fever, and productive cough, likely
   secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure [**1-18**] CAP: Several possible explanations,
   but infectious process is most likely, given fever and productive cough
   in a susceptible host, with CXR demonstrating areas of opacification at
   lung bases bilaterally (R>L), and CT demonstrating scattered GGOs and
   areas of nodularity in both lung fields. Atypical vs typical etiology.
   Legionella ruled out by negative urinary antigen. PCP unlikely, given
   [**Name9 (PRE) 11734**] LDH and current ppx regimen. Infection superimposed on
   underlying lung disease (possibly GVHD to lung, less likely pulmonary
   hypertension [**1-18**] untreated OSA or emphysematous changes) might account
   for why the patient's hypoxia appears out of proportion to the findings
   on CT. At baseline, pt
s DLCO is 50% and RA O2 sat is low-to-mid 90s.
   Possible, though less likely, that the patient has an intracardiac
   shunt (e.g. PFO) contributing to hypoxia in the setting of increased
   R-sided pressures from infection-driven hypoxia-induced
   vasoconstriction, which may be reflected in the RV strain pattern on
   EKG. No evidence of hypercarbic respiratory failure on ABG. PE ruled
   out by the CT angiogram. No prior history or exam/imaging findings to

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**6-22**]. He is currently experiencing hypoxia, fever, and productive cough following 2 days of symptoms. The patient's respiratory status has been stabilized overnight, and infiltrates appear to be increasing on chest X-ray (CXR) along with an increased productive cough. The patient is currently on non-rebreather mask and being treated with oxygen saturation (O2 sat) of 95%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia seems to be secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as indicated by fever, productive cough, and opacifications seen on CXR. Possible explanations for the patient's hypoxia include infection superimposed on underlying lung disease (GVHD to lung), untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or emphysematous changes. Legionella has been ruled out, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is less likely due to the patient's current prophylactic regimen. Other potential causes such as pulmonary hypertension, intracardiac shunt (e.g., patent foramen ovale), or heart failure have been considered but ruled out based on the patient's medical history and test results.

   severe GVHD to skin and liver, on steroids, presenting from oncology
   clinic with hypoxia, fever, and hypotension following 2 days of
   productive cough and lethargy.
   24 Hour Events:
   No acute events overnight.
   For hypoxia, pt maintained on non rebreather mask overnight, with O2
   sat between 93-98%.  On attempt to lower FiO2 this morning, O2 sat
   dropped to 85% on RA, 88% on 6L NC, and 88% on 35% FiO2 via Venti mask.
   Pt was switched back to the non rebreather, then transitioned to a cool
   nebulizer, with O2 sat maintained at approx 95%.
   Pt remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable overnight. He received
   a 1L NS bolus and was started on maintenance fluids, given no PO
   intake.
   Cardiac enzymes #2 and #3 returned negative.
   This morning, pt reports feeling much better, though he woke up
   drenched in sweat. He reports increased productive cough but denies
   dyspnea, chest pain (including pleurisy), nausea, abd pain, dizziness,
   palpitations, headache. His chronic LUE pain is well controlled. He
   expressed an interest in breakfast.

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and subsequent allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**6-22**], complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) to the skin and liver. He is currently presenting from the oncology clinic with symptoms of hypoxia, fever, and productive cough. The patient's condition is likely secondary to community-acquired pneumonia, as evidenced by his fever, cough, and chest X-ray demonstrating areas of infiltrate at the lung bases. The patient's hypoxia appears to be out of proportion to the findings on the CT scan, which shows scattered ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and areas of nodularity in both lung fields. Legionella infection has been ruled out, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is considered unlikely due to the patient's current prophylactic regimen.

Possible complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's profound hypoxia and fever suggest a severe respiratory infection, potentially leading to respiratory failure if not promptly treated.

2. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of fever, there is a risk of developing sepsis if the underlying infection is not adequately managed.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been steadily decreasing, which may be due to medication"

   55yM with a history of AML, s/p allogenic BMT in [**6-22**] complicated by
   severe GVHD to skin and liver, on steroids, presenting from oncology
   clinic with hypoxia, fever, and hypotension following 2 days of
   productive cough and lethargy.
   24 Hour Events:
   No acute events overnight.
   For hypoxia, pt maintained on non rebreather mask overnight, with O2
   sat between 93-98%.  On attempt to lower FiO2 this morning, O2 sat
   dropped to 85% on RA, 88% on 6L NC, and 88% on 35% FiO2 via Venti mask.
   Pt was switched back to the non rebreather, then transitioned to a cool
   nebulizer, with O2 sat maintained at approx 95%.
   For hypotension, pt received a 1L NS bolus last night and was started
   on maintenance fluids, given no PO intake. He remained afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable overnight.
   Cardiac enzyme sets 2 and 3 returned negative. Repeat EKG @ 8pm
   demonstrated NSR @ 86bpm; 1mm ST-segment depression in V4=V5,
   persistent T-wave inversions in V2-V6.
   This morning, pt reports feeling much better, though he woke up
   drenched in sweat. He reports increased productive cough but denies
   dyspnea, chest pain (including pleurisy), nausea, abd pain, dizziness,
   palpitations, headache. His chronic LUE pain is well controlled. He
   expressed an interest in breakfast.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yM with a history of AML, s/p allogenic BMT in [**6-22**] complicated by
   severe GVHD to skin and liver, on steroids, presenting from oncology
   clinic with profound hypoxia, fever, and productive cough, likely
   secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure [**1-18**] CAP: Several possible explanations,
   but infectious process is most likely, given fever and productive cough
   in a susceptible host, with CXR demonstrating areas of opacification at
   lung bases bilaterally (R>L), and CT demonstrating scattered GGOs and
   areas of nodularity in both lung fields. Atypical vs typical etiology.
   Legionella ruled out by negative urinary antigen. PCP unlikely, given
   [**Name9 (PRE) 11734**] LDH and current ppx regimen. Infection superimposed on
   underlying lung disease (possibly GVHD to lung, less likely pulmonary
   hypertension [**1-18**] untreated OSA or emphysematous changes) might account
   for why the patient's hypoxia appears out of proportion to the findings
   on CT. At baseline, pt
s DLCO is 50% and RA O2 sat is low-to-mid 90s.
   Possible, though less likely, that the patient has an intracardiac
   shunt (e.g. PFO) contributing to hypoxia in the setting of increased
   R-sided pressures from infection-driven hypoxia-induced
   vasoconstriction, which may be reflected in the RV strain pattern on
   EKG. No evidence of hypercarbic respiratory failure on ABG. PE ruled
   out by the CT angiogram. No prior history or exam/imaging findings to
   support diagnosis of CHF or COPD exacerbation.
   -Attempt to lower FiO2
   -Consider a trial of mask ventilation if O2 Sat < 90% on non rebreather
   -Vancomycin 1g IV Q12H (Day 1 is [**2-14**]) for Gram positive coverage
   -Aztreonam 1000 mg IV Q12H (Day 1 is [**2-14**]) for Gram negative coverage,
   given allergy to cephalosporins and quinolones
   -Doxycycline 100mg IV Q12H (Day 1 is [**2-14**]) for mycoplasma coverage

   -TMP-SMX 1 Tab DS Daily for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 11735**] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]>100.4 --> repeat blood and urine cx
   -PA/Lateral CXR tomorrow
   #) Hypotension: [**1-18**] dehydration, fluid responsive, now resolved.
   Initially concerning for sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency.
   -D/C stress-dose steroids
   -Resume home steroid regimen of 10mg prednisone PO daily
   -Advance diet
   -D/C maintenance fluids
   -Infectious work-up, as above
   #) EKG Changes: ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions initially
   concerning for demand ischemia in the setting of infection, but the
   ST-segment changes are an exaggeration of a baseline abnormality, and
   the patient ruled out for MI.
   -Repeat EKG today
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plt count 140s on admission, then 113 last night,
   down from 220s in [**12-26**]. Plt count stable in 110s this morning. Most
   likely explanation is medication side effect. Sulfa drugs, vancomycin,
   and pantoprazole can cause thrombocytopenia, though the time course is
   not right for any of these medications. Another possible explanation is
   HIT Type 1, although the patient's plt count was down from baseline
   prior to administration of subcutaneous heparin on the floor. ITP
   always possible, though this would be a diagnosis of exclusion.
   -Trend plt count
   -Continue subcutaneous heparin for DVT ppx unless plt<100
   #) DM2: Steroid-induced. Pt has been maintaining BS in 130s with 12
   units NPH in AM. No PO intake in past three days. Despite this,
   inpatient BS are 170s-180s, most likely [**1-18**] stress-dose steroids.
   -Continue 12 units NPH QAM
   -Insulin Sliding Scale PRN
   #) BMT/GVHD: Stable. Possible that GVHD to the lung is contributing to
   the patient
s hypoxia, as discussed above, though this is not a
   diagnosis we would make in the inpatient setting.
   -Continue steroids, as above
   -TMP-SMX 1 Tab DS Daily for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], as above
   -Continue Acyclovir for Herpes ppx
   -Continue Folic Acid 1mg daily
   -Vitamin D 400 units PO daily
   -Repeat PFTs in outpatient setting
   #) [**Last Name (un) **]: Pre-renal picture, now resolved. Creatinine 1.5 on admission,
   up from baseline of 0.9-1.0, with return to baseline following
   hydration.
   -Trend creatinine
   #) Nausea: Pt has 3-month hx of nausea/vomiting. GI work-up was
   essentially unrevealing. Barium swallow indicated mild esophagitis. EGD
   noted small hiatal hernia; biopsies were negative. H pylori studies
   were negative. Gastric emptying studying was normal. Hospital admission
   in [**12-26**] for this CC concluded that DDX included GERD vs adrenal
   insufficiency.
   -Continue Pantoprazole 40mg PO Q12H for GERD
   -Continue Budesonide 3mg PO TID
   -Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H PRN for nausea
   -Start bowel regimen: Colace + Senna
   #) Headache: Resolved. Pt was somnolent last night but had normal MS
   otherwise. Concern is for meningeal infection, though pt continues to
   have no focal neuro deficits or meningeal signs on exam.
   -LP if meningeal signs or neuro deficit develops, or headache returns
   and becomes unresponsive to pain meds
   -Acetaminophen PRN for pain
   #) Neuropathic pain: Stable. Continue at-home pain med regimen.
   -Oxycodone SR PO 60mg [**Hospital1 **], 20mg Q2PM
   -Hydromorphone 2-4mg PO Q6H PRN for pain

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and a previous allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting the skin and liver. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to parainfluenza infection. The patient's condition has improved significantly, with reduced oxygen requirements and maintained oxygen saturation in the low-to-mid 90s. The patient is also experiencing symptoms of nausea, possibly related to GERD, esophagitis, adrenal insufficiency, or GVHD involvement in the gut. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial superinfection: Given the possibility of bacterial superinfection, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be continued until speciation results are available.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of AML and previous BMT complicated by severe GVHD. GVHD can involve the lungs, leading to pneumonia. Continued monitoring for any worsening respiratory symptoms is necessary.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's fingerstick blood sugars were high during the day yesterday, likely secondary to stress-dose steroids in the morning and increased oral intake throughout the day. This may indicate uncontrolled diabetes or steroid-induced hyperglycemia.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has undergone an allogenic bone marrow transplant complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) to the skin and liver. He is currently on steroids and presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's 24-hour events indicate that he remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable, with gradually lowered oxygen requirements throughout the day. His oxygen saturation levels were maintained in the low-to-mid 90s.

Microbiology results show that Parainfluenza Type 1 is positive, while Influenza A and B are negative. Sputum culture grew Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative coccobacilli, and a few Gram-negative rods. Sputum culture for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) was negative, and fungal cultures are pending. Urine culture was also negative. Blood cultures are still pending.

Given the viral pneumonia with possible bacterial superinfection, the patient is being continued on vancomycin and aztreonam, while doxycycline has been discontinued.

The patient's clinical improvement is noted in the morning, with reduced cough and no headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, pleurisy, nausea, abdominal pain, or dizziness. He is eating a full diet and ambulating to the chair in his"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and subsequent allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) to the skin and liver. He is currently on steroids and presenting from the oncology clinic with profound hypoxia, fever, and productive cough. The patient's condition is likely secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). 

Microbiology results indicate a Parainfluenza Type 1 infection, with a possible bacterial superinfection. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and aztreonam for gram-positive and gram-negative coverage, respectively. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, blood pressure within normal range, heart rate of 68 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood cultures are pending. 

The patient's pain, nausea, and headache have resolved. He is currently clinically improved, reporting reduced cough and no other symptoms. He is eating a full diet and ambulating to a chair in his room. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Superinfection: The patient has a possible bacterial superinfection along with the Parainfluenza Type 1 infection. This may require further antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting his skin, lung, and liver. He was admitted with pneumonia, which initially suggested a viral infection with parainfluenza and a possible bacterial superinfection. The patient's respiratory status has shown improvement, and his white blood cell count is now normal. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and other medications for GVHD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially had pneumonia, which is a lung infection that can lead to respiratory distress and difficulty in breathing. However, the patient's respiratory status has improved with treatment.
2. GVHD: The patient has GVHD, which is a condition where the donated cells recognize the recipient's body as foreign and attack it. This can affect various organs, including the skin, lung, and liver. The patient is being treated with prednisone to manage GVHD.
3. Infection: Due to a compromised immune system from AML and GVHD, the patient is at risk of developing further infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms will be necessary to identify any signs of infection.
4. Bleeding: GVHD can also affect the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells, including platelets, increasing the risk of bleeding. Monitoring the patient's platelet count and signs of bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**6-22**]. He is currently in the ICU due to complications from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting his skin and lungs, as well as hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to a parainfluenza infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 110-156/67-94 mmHg, heart rate between 63-95 bpm, respiratory rate at 9-18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 90% on room air. He is able to ambulate around the pod while maintaining an oxygen saturation above 90% on 2 liters of nasal cannula, but required 3 liters of nasal cannula overnight due to an oxygen saturation below 90%. The patient denies cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.

Physical examination reveals good air movement bilaterally with end-inspiratory crackles at the right lung base. Wheezes were initially present overnight but not on the morning examination. Cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and obesely distended. There are wound problems on the right lower extremity.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a"

   55yM with a history of AML, s/p allogenic BMT in [**6-22**] complicated by
   GVHD to skin and liver, on steroids, presenting with hypoxic
   respiratory failure secondary to parainfluenza infection.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure [**1-18**] Parainfluenza infection: Clinically
   improved. Able to maintain O2 sat >90% on RA while ambulating but not
   while sleeping. Bacterial superinfection unlikely, given growth of
   commensal flora on sputum cx, but plan to continue abx until final
   speciation is determined.
   -Continue to wean O2 with goal of O2Sat>94% on RA (patient
s baseline)
   -Continue ambulation around floor
   -Continue Vancomycin 1g IV Q12H (Day 1 is [**2-14**]) for Gram pos coverage
   -Continue Aztreonam 1000 mg IV Q12H (Day 1 is [**2-14**]) for Gram neg
   coverage
   -f/u final sputum cx and fungal cx
   -f/u  blood cx
   -continue TMP-SMX 1 Tab DS Daily for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 11735**] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]>100.4 --> repeat blood and urine cx
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Count dropped to 110s from baseline of 200s on
   this admission but is now recovering and in the 140s today. Explanation
   unclear; likely medication side effect, given that the patient is on
   multiple drugs (Bactrim, PPI, Vanc) that can affect the plt count.
   -Continue to trend plt count
   -Continue subcutaneous heparin for DVT ppx unless plt<100
   #) DM2: Steroid-induced. Fingerstick BS were 300 at 12noon and 6pm
   yesterday, respectively. Better control overnight and this morning.
   Possible that AM NPH dose needs to be increased, though this change
   should be made in the outpatient setting.
   -Continue 12 units NPH QAM
   -Insulin Sliding Scale PRN
   #) BMT/GVHD: Stable. Possible that pt has GVHD involvement in the lung,
   given hypoxia out of proportion to CXR and CT findings.
   -Continue home dose steroids: Prednisone 10mg PO daily
   -TMP-SMX 1 Tab DS daily for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], as above
   -Continue Acyclovir for Herpes ppx
   -Continue Folic Acid 1mg daily
   -Vitamin D 400 units PO daily
   -Repeat PFTs in outpatient setting
   #) Nausea: Pt currently asymptomatic but has 3-month hx of
   nausea/vomiting attributed to GERD vs esophagitis vs adrenal
   insufficiency vs GVDH involvement in the gut.
   -Continue Pantoprazole 40mg PO Q12H for GERD
   -Continue Budesonide 3mg PO TID for gut GVHD
   -Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H PRN for nausea
   -Continue bowel regimen: Colace + Senna
   #) Neuropathic pain: Stable. Continue at-home pain med regimen.
   -Oxycodone SR PO 60mg [**Hospital1 **], 20mg Q2PM
   -Hydromorphone 2-4mg PO Q6H PRN for pain

- His current vital signs are stable, with an oxygen saturation level (SpO2) of 93% on room air. He is able to ambulate around the pod while maintaining an SpO2 >90% on 2 liters of nasal cannula, but required 3 liters of nasal cannula overnight due to low SpO2.
- There are no signs of wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
- Preliminary sputum culture shows heavy growth of commensal flora, and fungal culture reveals yeast.
- The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating between 5.4 and 7.9 thousand/mm3, platelet count between 113 and 147 thousand/mm3, and hemoglobin between 14.1 and 16 g/dL.
- He has an elevated blood glucose level of 189 mg/dL.

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in [**6-22**] and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting the skin and lung. He is currently on steroids and presents with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to a parainfluenza infection.

24-hour events:
- The patient remains afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
- He is able to ambulate around the pod while maintaining oxygen saturation (O2 sat) above 90% on room air (RA). Overnight, he was switched to 3 liters per minute nasal cannula (NC) due to O2 sat below 90%. This morning, he is on 3L NC with O2 sat of 97%.
- The patient reported wheezing overnight but does not have wheezing this morning. No cough, shortness of breath (SOB), or chest pain (CP).
- Preliminary sputum culture shows heavy growth of commensal flora.
- Antibiotics were continued despite low suspicion for bacterial superinfection due to the patient's history of BMT.
- The patient has allergies to cefepime, ciprofloxacin HCl, and doxycycline.
- The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2146-2-16**] at 10:05 AM.
