   # Hypertension: BP 200's/100's on admission. Has run similarly high on
   previous admissions. On labetalol drip and home doses of metoprolol,
   lisinopril, and amlodipine. Titrating meds to SBP's in 150's.
   - Uptitrate oral BP meds as needed; Could consider uptitrating
   metoprolol dose when transitioning off labetalol, or substituting
   nifedipine for amlodipine.

   # Mental Status Changes/? delerium: Pt described as confused and
   agitated which is a significant change from his baseline per his

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presented with hyperglycemia, emesis, significantly elevated blood pressures, and was found to have no ketonemia but with an elevated anion gap. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including fever of unknown origin, inability to protect his airway, hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, and mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's persistent fever needs to be investigated further to determine the underlying cause. Possible etiologies include infection or other inflammatory conditions.
2. Inability to protect his airway: Due to sedation and intubation, the patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this complication.
3. Hypertension: The patient's resistant hypertension requires careful management to prevent complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy, heart failure, or hemorrhagic stroke.
4. Hyperglycemia: Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate insulin therapy are necessary to manage this condition.
5. Renal failure: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires ongoing hemodialysis treatment to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presenting with hyperglycemia and emesis. He has significantly elevated blood pressures, which have been running high on previous admissions. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with fever, possibly of unknown origin, and is on coverage for meningitis. His mental status changes may be secondary to elevated blood pressure, uremia, or metabolic derangements related to hyperglycemia. He also has anemia likely due to chronic renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia/Hypoglycemia: The patient has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia, possibly due to infection or insulin non-compliance. It is important to monitor his blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state. Blood, CSF, and urine cultures should be done to rule out infection.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. His renal function should be monitored closely, and dialysis should be continued as scheduled.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. It will be necessary to titrate his medications to achieve a target blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's confusion and agitation could be due to various factors such as elevated blood pressure, uremia, or metabolic derangements. Correcting glucose and electrolyte abnormalities, providing dialysis, and re-evaluating mental status when the patient is extubated are important steps.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, likely due to chronic renal failure. A transfusion of packed red blood cells may be required, and iron studies should be checked.
7. Aspiration Risk: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration. Close monitoring and consideration of tracheostomy placement may be necessary.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is at increased risk for DVT and PE due to immobility and underlying conditions. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued.

Please note that the patient's condition may change, and additional complications may arise. Regular monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan will be necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia and emesis, significantly elevated blood pressures, and confusion. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever, unknown origin: The patient has been experiencing a fever, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Airway, inability to protect: Due to the patient's sedation and intubation, there is a risk of aspiration and altered airway clearance.
3. Hypertension, benign: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, and it is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels need to be controlled, and the cause of hyperglycemia needs to be investigated.
5. Renal failure, end stage: The patient's renal function is severely compromised, and ongoing hemodialysis is necessary to manage his condition.
6. Mental status changes/delerium: The patient's confusion and agitation may be due to various factors such as elevated blood pressure, uremia, metabolic derangements, or illicit drug use. It is important to address these potential causes and provide appropriate treatment.
7. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is low, likely due to chronic renal failure. Blood transf"

   This is a 24 yo male with type I DM, ESLD on HD, resistant HTN who
   presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and found to have significantly
   elevated blood pressures.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Would be classified as HHS given no ketonemia, though
   AG present. Possible etiologies include infection vs insulin
   non-compliance. AG resolved after only 10 units of IM regular insulin
   with serum glucose ranging 200's to 300's over past day
   - check FSBS q6 hours
   -For dialysis tomorrow- last received on [**10-7**]
   - Receiving dialysis tomorrow which should help to correct Na,K and
   HCO3
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] following- on lantus 6 units daily and [**Last Name (un) 276**] sliding scale.
   Will substitute novolog for humalog when patient's family able to bring

   # Anion Gap Acidosis: Possible etiologies include toxic ingestion vs
   lactic acidosis or [**3-7**] chronic renal failure. Unlikely to be
   ketoacidosis given negative serum ketoacids. However, AG resolved after
   only 10 units of IM insulin. Tox screen positive only for opiates.
   Lactate 1. Most likely [**3-7**] RF.
   - cont to monitor lytes

   # Hypertension: BP 200's/100's on admission. Has run similarly high on
   previous admissions. On labetalol drip and home doses of metoprolol,
   lisinopril, and amlodipine. Titrating meds to SBP's in 150's.
   - Uptitrate oral BP meds as needed; Could consider uptitrating
   metoprolol dose when transitioning off labetalol, or substituting
   nifedipine for amlodipine.
   .
   # Mental Status Changes/? delerium: Pt described as confused and
   agitated which is a significant change from his baseline per his
   family, currently he is intubated. Possible this was secondary to
   elevated SBP vs uremia vs metabolic derangements in setting of
   hyperglycemia vs illicit drug use. Head CT prelim read neg for any

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He remains delirious off sedation but able to protect his airway. He
   will extubate today precluding any issue with fevers or hemodymanics.
   We await HSV PCR before stopping antibiotics for meningitis although
   clinical suspicion is low. His fever curve has trended down too with no
   revealing culture data. BP control has been better as has glycemic
   control.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, resistant hypertension, and presenting with hyperglycemia, emesis, and significantly elevated blood pressures. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from his conditions.

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which can be classified as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) given the absence of ketonemia, although anion gap (AG) is present. Possible etiologies include infection versus insulin non-compliance. It is important to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels regularly and adjust insulin therapy as needed.

2. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient also has anion gap acidosis, which could be due to toxic ingestion, lactic acidosis, or chronic renal failure. However, AG resolved after only 10 units of IM insulin. Tox screen is positive only for opiates, and lactate level is normal. Most likely cause is RF (renal failure).

3. Hypertension: The patient has resistant hypertension, with blood pressures in the 200's/100's on admission. He is currently on labetalol drip and home doses of metoprolol, lisinopril, and amlodipine. Titrating medications to achieve systolic blood pressure in the 150's is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia, emesis, and significantly elevated blood pressures. The patient has been febrile on admission, cultures negative, and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern for infection as well as potential delirium due to mental status changes. The patient's platelet count is normal, which lowers the suspicion for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). However, the patient does have a history of TTP, and there is some component of uremic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Mental Status Changes: The patient is febrile and has mental status changes, which may indicate an infection or delirium. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia that could be due to infection, insulin non-compliance, or other factors. Blood glucose levels need to be monitored closely, and insulin therapy may be required.
3. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient had anion gap acidosis, but it has resolved. The possible causes include toxic ingestion, lactic acidosis, or chronic renal failure. Monitoring electrolytes is necessary.

   This is a 24 yo male with type I DM, ESLD on HD, resistant HTN who
   presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and found to have significantly
   elevated blood pressures.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Would be classified as HHS given no ketonemia, though
   AG present. Possible etiologies include infection vs insulin
   non-compliance. AG resolved after only 10 units of IM regular insulin
   with serum glucose ranging 200's to 300's over past day
   - check FSBS q6 hours
   -For dialysis tomorrow- last received on [**10-7**]
   - Receiving dialysis tomorrow which should help to correct Na,K and
   HCO3
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] following- on lantus 4 units daily and [**Last Name (un) 276**] sliding scale
   and conservative sliding scale
   - blood, csf, and urine cxs to rule out infection
   .
   # Anion Gap Acidosis: Possible etiologies include toxic ingestion vs
   lactic acidosis or [**3-7**] chronic renal failure. Unlikely to be
   ketoacidosis given negative serum ketoacids. However, AG resolved after
   only 10 units of IM insulin. Tox screen positive only for opiates.
   Lactate 1. Most likely [**3-7**] RF.
   - cont to monitor lytes
   .
   # Hypertension: BP 200's/100's on admission. Has run similarly high on
   previous admissions. On labetalol drip and home doses of metoprolol,
   lisinopril, and amlodipine. Titrating meds to SBP's in 150's.
   - Uptitrate oral BP meds as needed; Could consider uptitrating
   metoprolol dose when transitioning off labetalol, or substituting
   nifedipine for amlodipine.
   .
   # Mental Status Changes/? delerium: Pt described as confused and
   agitated which is a significant change from his baseline per his
   family, currently he is intubated. Possible this was secondary to
   elevated SBP vs uremia vs metabolic derangements in setting of
   hyperglycemia vs illicit drug use. Head CT prelim read neg for any
   acute IC process.
   - correct glucose and electrolyte abnormalities
   - dialysis tomorrow
   - f/u final head ct read
   - re-evaluate MS when pt extubated
   -LP shows no meningitis by cell counts. On vanc/ceftriaxone empirically
   pending cultures and received acyclovir x 1 (to be dosed c HD dose is
   350 p HD) pending neg PCR. Will f/u csf cultures. gram stain is

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia, emesis, significantly elevated blood pressures, and mental status changes.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hyperglycemia: This could progress to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) if not managed properly. It is important to monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin dosage accordingly.

2. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) puts him at risk for further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and ongoing hemodialysis will be necessary to prevent complications.

3. Hypertension: The patient's resistant hypertension may lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or heart failure if not effectively managed. Adjusting medication doses and considering additional antihypertensive agents may be required.

4. Infection: The presence of fever of unknown origin (FUO) and elevated white blood cell count (WBC) indicates a potential infection. Cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics have been started empirically. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjustment of antibiotic therapy based on culture results will be important.

5. Mental status changes: The patient's confusion and agitation could be due to various factors such"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He has safely extubated but continues to avoid interaction with Rn/
   MD
s. It is unclear if he is more responsive to his girlfriend and
   family. MRI of brain to be performed to assess for white matter change
   ( PRES) but psychiatry evaluation is warranted at this time. If MRI is
   without concern, he will then leave the ICU but will need a sitter or
   family at bedside.

The patient's current condition includes fever, altered mental status, inability to protect airway, hyperglycemia, renal failure, and resistant hypertension.

1. Fever/Mental Status Changes/? delirium: The patient's refusal to speak and history of oppositional defiant disorder may be contributing to his current mental status changes. There is also concern for infection as he was febrile on admission, cultures negative, and on broad-spectrum antibiotics. A head CT showed no acute intracranial process, but there is still concern for infection or uremic encephalopathy. Correcting glucose and electrolyte abnormalities, performing dialysis, and obtaining a psych consult are planned.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia could be classified as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) given the absence of ketonemia, although an osmotic gap is present. Possible etiologies include infection versus insulin non-compliance. The osmotic gap resolved after administering 10 units of IM regular insulin with serum glucose ranging from 70 to 200 mg/dL over the past day. Monitoring blood glucose levels every two hours and adjusting insulin dosages"

   This is a 24 yo male with type I DM, ESLD on HD, resistant HTN who
   presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and found to have significantly
   elevated blood pressures.
   .
   # Fever/Mental Status Changes/? delirium: Pt is volitionally not
   speaking right now. He does have a history of oppositional defiant
   disorder. Was agitated and confused on admission. It is difficult to do
   a neuro exam or get a sense of his mental status right now as he is not
   cooperating. Head CT read neg for any acute IC process.  Still concern
   for infection as febrile on admission, cultures negative and on broad
   spectrum Abx. Pt does have history of TTP, but platelets not low. [**Month (only) 60**]
   also have had some component of uremic encephalopathy.
   - correct glucose and electrolyte abnormalities
   - will check peripheral smear for schistocytes, but low suspicion for
   TTP in light of normal platelet count.
   - dialysis today
   - psych consult in light of ODD; will hope to have patient more
   interactive so can get clearer picture of mental status. Otherwise may
   need MRI as per neuro.
   -LP shows no meningitis by cell counts. On vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir
   empirically pending cultures. Will f/u csf cultures. gram stain is
   negative.
   -f/u pan cultures
   # Hyperglycemia: Would be classified as HHS given no ketonemia, though
   AG present. Possible etiologies include infection vs insulin
   non-compliance. AG resolved after only 10 units of IM regular insulin
   with serum glucose ranging <70 to 200
s over past day.
   - check FSBS q2 hours
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] following- on lantus 4 units daily and [**Last Name (un) 276**] sliding scale
   and conservative sliding scale
   - blood, csf, and urine cxs to rule out infection
   .
   # Anion Gap Acidosis: Resolved. Possible etiologies include toxic
   ingestion vs lactic acidosis or [**3-7**] chronic renal failure. Unlikely to
   be ketoacidosis given negative serum ketoacids. However, AG resolved
   after only 10 units of IM insulin. Tox screen positive only for
   opiates. Lactate 1. Most likely [**3-7**] RF.
   - cont to monitor lytes
   .
   # Hypertension: BP 200's/100's on admission. Has run similarly high on
   previous admissions. On labetalol drip and home doses of metoprolol,
   lisinopril, and amlodipine. Titrating meds to SBP's in 150's.
   -off labetalol drip. On metoprolol TID, lisinopril, amlodipine.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Last HD on [**10-7**]. Getting 1 kg off today with dialysis.
   - renal dialysis fellow aware pt in house
   - cont nephrocaps
   .
   #Anemia: s/p 1 unit PRBC. Likely [**3-7**] chronic renal failure (baseline
   about 25)
   -recheck PM Hct
   -will need epo after dialysis

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He has safely extubated but continues to avoid interaction with Rn/
   MD
s. It is unclear if he is more responsive to his girlfriend and
   family. MRI of brain to be performed to assess for white matter change
   ( PRES) but psychiatry evaluation is warranted at this time. If MRI is
   without concern, he will then leave the ICU but will need a sitter or
   family at bedside.

   Psychiatry service consulted, expressed concern for delirium and
   recommended MRI for further evaluation.  MRI ordered and Haldol, Ativan
   given for pre-treatment, but in MRI the patient became very agitated,
   sat up suddenly, threatened to roll out of the bed.  MRI was stopped
   and cancelled before study could be obtained.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia and emesis. He has significantly elevated blood pressures. The patient has been agitated and confused on admission. He is not interacting with hospital staff or physicians, except for speaking with his girlfriend on the telephone. His mental status is altered, and he is uncooperative with the neurologic examination. A head CT scan shows no acute intracranial process. The patient has a history of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) but with normal platelet count. He also has uremic encephalopathy. 

The patient's fever and mental status changes are unresolved. His blood cultures are pending, and he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. His respiratory culture is negative for infection. His urine culture is also pending. He is extubated and able to breathe on his own with supplemental oxygen. His blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments. He has hyperglycemia, which is classified as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). 

The patient's anion gap acidosis has resolved. Possible etiologies include toxic ingestion, lactic acidosis, or chronic renal failure. The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic renal failure. He received a unit of packed red blood cells."

   This is a 24 yo male with type I DM, ESLD on HD, resistant HTN who
   presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and found to have significantly
   elevated blood pressures.

   # Fever/Mental Status Changes/? delirium: Pt is volitionally not
   speaking right now. He does have a history of oppositional defiant
   disorder. Was agitated and confused on admission. It is difficult to do
   a neuro exam or get a sense of his mental status right now as he is not
   cooperating. Head CT read neg for any acute IC process.  Still concern
   for infection as febrile on admission, cultures negative and on broad
   spectrum Abx. Pt does have history of TTP, but platelets not low. [**Month (only) 60**]
   also have had some component of uremic encephalopathy.

   empirically pending cultures. will d/c today. would continue acyclovir
   until negative pcr
   -could consider check tsh to r/o hyperthyroid though this is lower on
   the ddx
   # Hyperglycemia: Would be classified as HHS given no ketonemia, though
   AG present. Possible etiologies include infection vs insulin
   non-compliance. AG resolved after only 10 units of IM regular insulin
   with serum glucose ranging <70 to 200

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. The patient presents with hyperglycemia, emesis, significantly elevated blood pressures, and a previous history of TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), although platelet count is normal. The patient is also experiencing fever, mental status changes, and possible delirium. 

The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and end-stage renal disease. The initial assessment suggests that the patient may have an infection, possibly with sepsis, given the fever and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to uremic encephalopathy or an infection. 

The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. These fluctuations may be due to insulin non-compliance or an underlying infection. 

The patient's blood pressure is still elevated despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. 

Renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and the need for hemodialysis. 

The patient has anemia, which is likely due to chronic renal failure. 

Hematuria is present, which could be related to Foley catheter trauma.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and resistant hypertension. The patient presents with hyperglycemia, emesis, significantly elevated blood pressures, and has been agitated and confused on admission. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Fever/Mental Status Changes: The patient has a history of oppositional defiant disorder and is currently not speaking volitionally. He was agitated and confused on admission, making it difficult to assess his mental status. The head CT scan did not show any acute intracranial process, but there is still concern for infection as the patient was febrile on admission, and cultures are negative. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and a peripheral smear for schistocytes will be checked to rule out thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), although the low suspicion for TTP is due to the normal platelet count. Psychiatric consultation is planned, and the need for an MRI will be considered again since the patient does not have the capacity to refuse it per psych evaluation.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been high, indicating hyperglycemia. This could be due to infection or insulin non-compliance. The patient's serum glucose has ranged from <70 to 200"

   This is a 24 yo male with type I DM, ESLD on HD, resistant HTN who
   presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and found to have significantly
   elevated blood pressures.
   .
   # Fever/Mental Status Changes/? delirium: Pt is was not speaking to
   medical staff yesterday but today he is. However, he seems to be
   laughing and crying anappropriately. Pt
s mom says pt does not usually
   cry while hospitalized. He does have a history of oppositional defiant
   disorder. Was agitated and confused on admission. It is difficult to do
   a neuro exam or get a sense of his mental status right now as he is not
   cooperating. Head CT read neg for any acute IC process.  Still concern
   for infection as febrile on admission, cultures negative and on broad
   spectrum Abx. Pt does have history of TTP, but platelets not low. [**Month (only) 60**]
   also have had some component of uremic encephalopathy.
   - correct glucose and electrolyte abnormalities
   - will check peripheral smear for schistocytes, but low suspicion for
   TTP in light of normal platelet count.
   - HD yesterday
   - psych following
   - will need to consider whether MRI is worth trying again as pt does
   not have capacity to refuse per psych, will d/w neuro but holding on
   MRI for now.
   -LP shows no meningitis by cell counts. On vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir
   empirically pending cultures. will d/c vanc and ceftriaxone today.
   would continue acyclovir until negative pcr
   -could consider check tsh to r/o hyperthyroid though this is lower on
   the ddx
   # Hyperglycemia: Would be classified as HHS given no ketonemia, though
   AG present. Possible etiologies include infection vs insulin
   non-compliance. AG resolved after only 10 units of IM regular insulin
   with serum glucose ranging <70 to 200
s over past day.
   - check FSBS q2 hours
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] following- on lantus 4 units daily and [**Last Name (un) 276**] sliding scale

   # Anion Gap Acidosis: Resolved. Possible etiologies include toxic
   ingestion vs lactic acidosis or [**3-7**] chronic renal failure. Unlikely to
   be ketoacidosis given negative serum ketoacids. However, AG resolved
   after only 10 units of IM insulin. Tox screen positive only for
   opiates. Lactate 1. Most likely [**3-7**] RF.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and is found to have significantly elevated blood pressures. The patient's fever, mental status changes, and history of oppositional defiant disorder raise concerns for possible infection or delirium. The patient's hematuria is likely due to Foley trauma. The patient's anemia is likely secondary to chronic renal failure. The patient's hypertension is being managed with medication, but his blood pressure remains elevated. The patient's hyperglycemia is classified as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) given the absence of ketonemia, although the presence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) suggests possible insulin non-compliance. The patient's hypoglycemia was likely due to excessive insulin administration. The patient's anion gap acidosis has resolved. The patient's renal failure is being managed with hemodialysis. The patient's hyperthyroidism should be ruled out as a potential cause of his symptoms. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia and emesis. The patient has significantly elevated blood pressures and is currently on multiple medications to control his hypertension. He also has a fever, mental status changes, and an unknown origin of infection. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including fever of unknown origin, hyperglycemia, airway compromise, hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient presents with a persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. This could indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels may be due to poorly controlled diabetes, infection, or insulin non-compliance.
3. Airway Compromise: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration and altered gas exchange.
4. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure levels require close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease necessitates ongoing hemodialysis to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels suggest chronic renal failure as the underlying cause.
7. Hematuria: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage liver disease, resistant hypertension, presenting with hyperglycemia and emesis. The patient has significantly elevated blood pressures. Fever and mental status changes are improving, but there is concern for possible delirium. CSF cultures are negative, so antimicrobials will be discontinued except for acyclovir until HSV studies from the CSF are available. An MRI has been postponed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes and confusion indicate a potential delirium. Delirium can be caused by various factors such as infections, metabolic disturbances, or medications. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in mental status and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels indicate hyperglycemia. This could be due to poorly controlled diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels and maintaining glycemic control through regular insulin sliding scale are crucial.
3. Anion gap acidosis: The patient previously had anion gap acidosis, which resolved after administering insulin. Possible causes include toxic ingestion, lactic acidosis, or chronic renal failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and prevent its recurrence.
4. Hypertension: The patient has resistant hypertension. It is important to manage blood pressure effectively to prevent complications such as"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and has significantly elevated blood pressures.

The patient's medical history includes a history of oppositional defiant disorder, TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), and ESLD (end-stage liver disease). He also has a history of uremic encephalopathy.

The patient's current condition includes fever with unknown origin, hypoglycemia, inability to protect airway, hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal failure, and mental status changes. His vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1 C (98.7 F)
- Heart rate: 90 bpm
- Blood pressure: 185/107 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The assessment and plan include:
- Fever/Mental Status Changes/? delirium: The patient is agitated and confused, and there is concern for infection.
- Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugar levels, possibly due to infection or insulin non-compliance.
- Hypoglycemia: The patient had low blood sugar levels this morning.
- Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, and it has been difficult to control.
- ESRD on HD: The patient is on hemodialysis and received a blood transfusion.
- Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, likely due to chronic renal failure.
- Hematuria: The patient has blood in his urine, possibly due to Foley trauma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and mental status changes raise concern for an underlying infection.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS): The patient's hyperglycemia and lack of ketonemia suggest a possible diagnosis of HHS.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels can be potentially dangerous if not managed properly.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function.
5. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's significantly elevated blood pressure can lead to complications such as stroke or heart attack if not managed promptly.

It is important to monitor the patient closely and address these potential complications promptly to ensure optimal care and prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia, emesis, significantly elevated blood pressures, fever, mental status changes, and agitation. The patient's medical history includes oppositional defiant disorder, transient thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and chronic renal failure. His current medications include hydralazine, labetalol, Haldol, insulin (Lantus and sliding scale), metoprolol, clonidine patch, Norvasc, lisinopril, sevelamer, and erythropoietin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Mental Status Changes/possible delirium: The patient is febrile and experiencing mental status changes, including laughing and crying inappropriately. His ability to cooperate with neurologic exams is limited. A head CT showed no acute intracranial process. There is concern for infection, as he was febrile on admission and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's history of TTP and uremic encephalopathy should also be considered.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which could be classified as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). Possible etiologies include infection or insulin non-compliance. His serum glucose levels"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension.
- He presents with hyperglycemia, emesis, significantly elevated blood pressures, fever, mental status changes, agitation, and confusion.
- The patient has a history of oppositional defiant disorder and previously had a condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but his platelet count is not low.
- He also has a history of uremic encephalopathy.
- Lab results show elevated blood glucose levels, renal failure, anemia, and hematuria.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, insulin, and medications for blood pressure control.
- He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically pending cultures.
- The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been febrile on admission, which may indicate an underlying infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the fever.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced low blood sugar levels, which could be due to insulin administration or other factors. Monitoring and adjustment of insulin dosage may be necessary.
3. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS): The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presented with hyperglycemia, emesis, significantly elevated blood pressures, and fever. The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with episodes of agitation, confusion, and inappropriate laughing and crying. A head CT scan showed no acute intracranial process. The patient has a history of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but his platelet count is not low. He also has some component of uremic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Mental Status Changes/? Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and inappropriate emotional responses may indicate delirium. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset and fluctuating course of inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. It can be caused by various factors such as infections, metabolic abnormalities, or medication side effects.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been experiencing hyperglycemia, which can be classified as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) due to the absence of ketonemia, although the presence of osmolar gap suggests high blood sugar levels. Possible etiologies include infection or insulin non-compliance. It is important to closely monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust insulin dosage accordingly.

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 24-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage liver disease on hemodialysis, and resistant hypertension. He presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and is found to have significantly elevated blood pressures. The patient's fever has resolved, and his neurologic examination shows right hand weakness. He is scheduled for a head MRI.

The patient has labile sugars and requires continued management. His hypertension will be managed with labetolol po plus clonidine, amlodipine, and ACE-I. He is currently on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease and will receive treatment for other issues as per the ICU team.

In terms of medical complications, potential concerns include:
1. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes may indicate delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, metabolic imbalances, or medication side effects.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's labile sugars indicate uncontrolled blood glucose levels. If not managed properly, this can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
3. Hypertension: The patient's resistant hypertension requires careful management to prevent complications like stroke or cardiac events.
4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis, which is a treatment for ESRD. Complications related to dialysis access, fluid balance, electrolyte imbalances, and"
