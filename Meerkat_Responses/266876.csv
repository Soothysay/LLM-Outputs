","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the past. She was transferred from another hospital for management of melena and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient presented with diffuse ECG changes and troponin leak in the setting of melena and possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Global ECG changes and troponin leak are consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of UGIB. The cardiac enzymes will be trended overnight.

The patient had melena at the outside hospital with a hematocrit (Hct) of 26, which is down from 31 on her last admission in 12/2178. She received two large bore IVs, type and cross 2uPRBC, pantoprazole 40mg IV BID, and a GI consult. The patient is also being monitored with q6h Hct and guiac all stools. She will be transfused for Hct > 30.

Other medical conditions include hypertension, hypothyroidism, anxiety, and food intolerance. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of GIB and presented with melena, indicating a possible UGIB. The patient has been given pantoprazole and is being monitored for further bleeding.
2. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient presented with diffuse ECG changes and troponin leak, consistent with NSTEMI. Cardiac enzymes will be trended overnight.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 31 to 26, indicating anemia. The patient is being transfused with PRBCs to increase Hct to >30.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to immobilization and medical conditions. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) should be considered.
6. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and medication use. Prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is appropriate.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk for VAP. Measures to prevent VAP should be implemented, such as proper hand hygiene, oral care, and respiratory hygiene.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information or tests may be necessary to determine a more accurate assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the past. She was transferred from another hospital for management of melena and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient presented with diffuse ECG changes and troponin leak in the setting of melena and possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Global ECG changes and troponin leak are consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of her UGIB. The enzymes are being trended overnight.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) was initially 26% but has stabilized after receiving three packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions. No blood loss was observed overnight. The source of bleeding is unclear, but the antrum is suspected as the possible site; gastrointestinal consultation has been obtained. Records for the patient's past history of bleeding will be obtained.

The patient has been placed on pantoprazole 40mg IV BID for prophylaxis against stress ulcers. Two large bore intravenous (IV) lines have been inserted, and the patient has been typed and crossed for two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). 

The patient's medications have been adjusted due to the bleeding event. Metoprolol and lasix, which are used for hypertension, have been held. Lorazepam"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of CAD, HTN, and GIB, who was admitted for management of melena and NSTEMI. She has been experiencing ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and her hematocrit (Hct) levels have been fluctuating. The source of the bleeding is unclear, but GAVE syndrome is suspected. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 97/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and has been advanced to a regular diet. Her medications include a statin and aspirin, while Plavix, metoprolol, and lasix have been held due to the bleeding. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 153 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, troponin T of 1.12, and glucose of 103 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the past. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of melena and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) was stable after receiving three packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions. However, her Hct dropped from 32.5 to 28.8 this morning, indicating ongoing bleeding. The source of the bleeding is unclear, but given the patient's history of Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE) syndrome, it is suspected to be the cause. The patient underwent a consultation with the gastroenterology (GI) department, which decided against performing an endoscopy while the patient is inpatient unless she starts bleeding briskly or becomes hemodynamically unstable. 

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the ongoing bleeding.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,005 mL, with 720 mL given orally, 10 mL intravenously, and 275 mL of blood products. The total output was 627 mL through urine and 360 mL through nasogastric (NG) tube. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery through a non-invasive device, maintaining an oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and comfortable in bed. Her conjunctiva is pink, and her neck supple with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 10 cm. No abnormalities were noted in her cardiac examination. Her lungs are clear without any crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No extremity abnormalities were observed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.9 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.8 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 27.9%, platelet count of 153 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL, troponin T level of 1.12 ng/mL, and glucose level of 103 mg/dL. Other lab values include a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 25.9 seconds, elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1, and elevated levels of troponin T and CK-MB. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current medical conditions include NSTEMI, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and anxiety. For the NSTEMI, the patient's ischemia demands further evaluation, and she should continue on statin and aspirin while holding Plavix and metoprolol in the setting of bleeding. The troponin T levels are trending down, and CK levels are negative.

Regarding the UGIB, the patient's Hct dropped significantly, and she has received three pRBC transfusions. She is currently being monitored closely, and pantoprazole has been initiated to reduce gastric acid secretion. The patient has also been advised to continue with guaiac testing of stools and to receive further transfusions as necessary to maintain a hematocrit level above 30%. 

For the patient's hypertension, it is recommended to hold metoprolol and Lasix in the setting of bleeding. 

In terms of hypothyroidism, the patient's levothyroxine should be changed back to oral administration.

Lastly, lorazepam is being used as needed for anxiety management.

ICU care includes a heart-healthy diet and glycemic control. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to be transferred to Hospital Ward 408 tomorrow."
