   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9848**] is a 71 year old male with ESRD on HD, PVD, CAD s/p NSTEMI,
   here with altered mental status and sepsis requiring pressors likely
   secondary to osteo of right foot, although line infection or other
   sites of osteo cannot be excluded.
   .
   Sepsis.  Hypotension likely secondary to sepsis given that patient has
   elevated WBC and large amounts of necrotic tissue on both feet and
   hands.  Suspect that right foot osteo is the source, but may also be
   secondary to bacterial seeding from skin breakdown, line infection (has
   tunnelled HD line), or other occult source.  No clear source of
   pneumonia.  Given low voltages, will get echo to evaluate for effusion
   (though echo today at OSH did not show temponade).  Also, echo can be
   obtained to look for endocarditis.
   - follow up blood cultures, UA, UCx
   - f/u final read of foot and hand films to evaluate for osteo
   - vascular following but do not feel foot is the source
   - vanco/zosyn/cipro for double gram negative coverage in setting of
   diabetic foot osteo and GPC for dialysis patient with tunelled HD line
   - echo to evaluate EF and look for endocarditis
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Levophed to maintain MAPS> 60, consider starting vasopressin if this
   causes significant tachycardia
   - obtain OSH records of micro data
   .
   Gangrenous foot and digits/ PVD.  Patient has b/l gangrenous toes and
   toe stumps which have significantly worsened over the last year. In
   [**10-22**], he was noted to have ""a 2-cm ulceration over the site of the
   fifth digit TMA [on the left foot].""  Vascular evaluated the patient,
   but do not feel that he needs urgent amputation.  Foot films
   demonstrated osteo worst at the right foot.  He is likely not a
   surgical candidate given his recent NSTEMIs and was declined for
   revascularization.
   - vascular consult for management of gangrenous extremities
   - ABIs per vascular
   - vanco/zosyn/cipro to cover infection
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - morphine PRN foot pain
   .
   Altered mental status.  Even with vietnamese translator, patient was
   confused, although has had some improvement of mental status throughout
   the night.  Likely delerium in the setting of hypotension and
   infection.  OVerall seems to be improving.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - continue IVFs and pressors to maintain MAPs> 60
   - limit sedating meds, but will resume seroquel given agitation
   - will continue morphine in spite of sedating effects given the degree
   of his pain
   - consider head CT if no improvement of mental status over 24 hours
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient presented with hypoglycemia at OSH but was
   hyperglycemic on arrival.  Had episodes of hypoglycemia overnight on
   insulin drip so transistion to ISS.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   End stage renal disease on HD.  Likely secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  Has hyperphosphatemia.  No urgent dialysis needs.
   - will notify renal of his arrival, patient typically gets HD MWF but
   at this point would need CVVH given hypotension requiring pressors
   - initiate phos binders when eating
   .
   Hypertension.
   - hold antihypertensives in setting of hypotension requiring pressors
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease.  Patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and
   significantly reduced EF over the course of 1 year.  Was told that he
   needed revascularization but was not felt to be a cath candidate.
   - continue aspirin and statin
   - hold BB
   .
   Depression.
   - continue seroquel, celexa
   .
   H/o A.fib with RVR.
   - hold coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   - follow INR
   .
   Goals of care.  Per medical record, patient would like to be DNR/DNI.
   According to the record, patient's daughter reversed his code status
   and ""demanded that he be full code"".  I spoke with both daughters and
   the wife through the hospital provided vietnamese interpreter and all
   three parties confirmed that the wife is the health care proxy.  She
   agrees with the patient's desires for DNR/DNI.  The wife and daughter
   will arrive tomorrow morning for a more formal goals of care discussion
   with a possible movement towards comfort measures if no overall
   improvement.  Awaiting family meeting today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status and sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/47 mmHg to 115/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. He is on norepinephrine at a dose of 0.1 mcg/kg/min for blood pressure support.

The patient has multiple gangrenous limbs and foot stumps, suggestive of peripheral arterial disease. Foot films show osteomyelitis (bone infection) worse at the right foot. The source of sepsis is suspected to be the right foot osteomyelitis, but other sites such as line infection or other occult sources cannot be excluded.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin) to cover for gram-negative bacteria and gram-positive bacteria, including MR"

   Goals of care.  Per medical record, patient would like to be DNR/DNI.
   According to the record, patient's daughter reversed his code status
   and ""demanded that he be full code"".  I spoke with both daughters and
   the wife through the hospital provided vietnamese interpreter and all
   three parties confirmed that the wife is the health care proxy.  She
   agrees with the patient's desires for DNR/DNI.  The wife and daughter
   will arrive tomorrow morning for a more formal goals of care discussion
   with a possible movement towards comfort measures if no overall
   improvement.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and sepsis requiring vasopressors. The source of sepsis is likely osteomyelitis of the right foot, although other sites of infection cannot be excluded. The patient also has gangrenous extremities, specifically b/l gangrenous toes, which have significantly worsened over the past year. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/47 mmHg to 115/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. He is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,020 mL and output of 705 mL since 12 AM.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.0 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, normal platelet count of 277 K/uL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), gangrene, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted to the ICU with presumed septic shock due to gangrene, osteomyelitis, and altered mental status. The patient has expressed a desire for do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status, but there is some uncertainty regarding code status due to discordance among family members.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.4Â°F), blood pressure ranging from 102/60 mmHg to 115/75 mmHg, heart rate between 90-130 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 47 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is dependent on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support and has received a total of 1.7 liters of normal saline intravenous fluids since yesterday. There is a balance of 1,020-1,061 mL of fluids.

The patient's blood work shows leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.0-14.7 thousand/mmÂ³, elevated creatinine levels of 5.1-5.3 mg/d"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 78M ESRD, CAD / DCM, AF on coumadin, HTN,
   severe PVD, altered mental status at rehab, initially p/w hypotension
   and leukocytosis to OSH - sources include gangrenous foot, HD line, or
   (less likely) lungs.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.1 BP 102/60 HR 80 RR 18 with sat 94-100 on 4LNC.
   WD man, responds to simple commands, denies pain. Coarse BS with
   intermittent exp wheeze. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS, mild diffuse tenderness.
   Severe distal gangrene as outlined. Labs notable for WBC 14K, HCT 35,
   K+ 4.0, Cr 5.3, Tn 0.25, lactate 2.1. CXR with medial BLL changes, EKG
   low volts.
   Agree with plan to manage septic shock with IVF bolus now, weaning of
   levophed as able, and broad antibiotic coverage with zosyn, cipro and
   vanco dosed to level, while awaiting culture results. Suspect much of
   this is driven by deep tissue infection in his feet. Will check echo
   for possible endocarditis and to r/o effusion given hypotension and low
   volts. Will recheck CXR in the setting of volume resuscitation,
   especially given low EF. Severe PVD with gangrene and likely osteo -
   continue [**Year (4 digits) **] and [**Year (4 digits) 1495**], vascular following, will check arterial
   studies today. Will hold off on arterial line given severity of PVD and
   will resite CVL or place PICC after discussing risks and benefits with
   the family. HD per renal team for ESRD, no acute indication at this
   point, will try to get him off pressors to avoid CVVH. Will get wound
   care consult for multiple ulcers. For poorly controlled DM, will hold
   off on insulin drip given hypoglycemia, and will continue RISS. In
   terms of the overall direction of care, it is unclear at this point if
   patient would want further invasive procedures, including foot
   amputation to control sepsis, at this point. Plan for family meeting
   with Vietnamese interpreter at noon. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted on [**8-16**] with presumed septic shock due to gangrene and osteomyelitis, as well as altered mental status. The patient has expressed a desire for do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status, but there is some uncertainty regarding the code status due to discordance between family members. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is presumed to be in septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple possible infectious sources, including gangrene, HD line, and endocarditis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further management will depend on the results of cultures and imaging studies.
3. PVD/Gangrene: The patient has severe PVD with gangrene of the right foot. Aggressive care may require amputation, and further management will depend on the family's decision regarding the goals of care.
4. CAD/NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and experienced an NSTEMI. It is important to manage his cardiac condition carefully, especially during periods of shock and infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) who had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is now presenting with altered mental status and sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 94/53 mmHg to 126/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 83%. 

The physical examination reveals diminished right radial pulse, diminished left radial pulse, absent right dorsal pedal pulse, and absent left dorsal pedal pulse. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased creatinine level, elevated lactate level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and is currently receiving morphine sulfate for pain management. The family has made the decision to withdraw pressors and provide comfort care, with plans to remove the patient from the ventilator once his family members arrive. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of cardiovascular status, respiratory distress due to removal from the ventilator, and potential infections at other sites."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9848**] is a 71 year old male with ESRD on HD, PVD, CAD s/p NSTEMI,
   here with altered mental status and sepsis requiring pressors likely
   secondary to osteo of right foot, although line infection or other
   sites of osteo cannot be excluded.  Plan to become CMO today after
   arrival of family members.
   .
   Goals of care.  Family meeting yesterday to make patient DNR/ DNI with
   no escalation of care.  Plan to make patient CMO today after his family
   members arrive.
   .
   Sepsis.  Hypotension likely secondary to sepsis given that patient has
   elevated WBC and large amounts of necrotic tissue on both feet and
   hands.  Suspect that right foot osteo is the source, but may also be
   secondary to bacterial seeding from skin breakdown, line infection (has
   tunnelled HD line), or other occult source.  No clear source of
   pneumonia.  Given low voltages, will get echo to evaluate for effusion
   (though echo today at OSH did not show temponade).  Also, echo can be
   obtained to look for endocarditis.
   - follow up blood cultures, UA, UCx
   - f/u final read of foot and hand films to evaluate for osteo
   - vascular following but do not feel foot is the source
   - vanco/zosyn/cipro for double gram negative coverage in setting of
   diabetic foot osteo and GPC for dialysis patient with tunelled HD line
   - echo to evaluate EF and look for endocarditis
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Levophed to maintain MAPS> 60, consider starting vasopressin if this
   causes significant tachycardia
   - obtain OSH records of micro data
   .
   Gangrenous foot and digits/ PVD.  Patient has b/l gangrenous toes and
   toe stumps which have significantly worsened over the last year. In
   [**10-22**], he was noted to have ""a 2-cm ulceration over the site of the
   fifth digit TMA [on the left foot].""  Vascular evaluated the patient,
   but do not feel that he needs urgent amputation.  Foot films
   demonstrated osteo worst at the right foot.  He is likely not a
   surgical candidate given his recent NSTEMIs and was declined for
   revascularization.
   - vascular consult for management of gangrenous extremities
   - ABIs per vascular
   - vanco/zosyn/cipro to cover infection
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - morphine PRN foot pain
   .
   Altered mental status.  Even with vietnamese translator, patient was
   confused, although has had some improvement of mental status throughout
   the night.  Likely delerium in the setting of hypotension and
   infection.  OVerall seems to be improving.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - continue IVFs and pressors to maintain MAPs> 60
   - limit sedating meds, but will resume seroquel given agitation
   - will continue morphine in spite of sedating effects given the degree
   of his pain
   - consider head CT if no improvement of mental status over 24 hours
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient presented with hypoglycemia at OSH but was
   hyperglycemic on arrival.  Had episodes of hypoglycemia overnight on
   insulin drip so transistion to ISS.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   End stage renal disease on HD.  Likely secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  Has hyperphosphatemia.  No urgent dialysis needs.
   - will notify renal of his arrival, patient typically gets HD MWF but
   at this point would need CVVH given hypotension requiring pressors
   - initiate phos binders when eating
   .
   Hypertension.
   - hold antihypertensives in setting of hypotension requiring pressors
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease.  Patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and
   significantly reduced EF over the course of 1 year.  Was told that he
   needed revascularization but was not felt to be a cath candidate.
   - continue aspirin and statin
   - hold BB
   .
   Depression.
   - continue seroquel, celexa
   .
   H/o A.fib with RVR.
   - hold coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   - follow INR
   .
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), diabetes mellitus type 2, gangrenous foot and digits, depression, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), and hypophosphatemia. He presents with altered mental status, sepsis requiring pressors, likely secondary to osteomyelitis of the right foot, although line infection or other sites of osteomyelitis cannot be excluded. The patient is DNR/DNI with no escalation of care. The plan is to make the patient comfort measures only (CMO) today after his family members arrive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection, including elevated white blood cell count, large amounts of necrotic tissue on both feet and hands, and hypotension. This indicates a severe infection that could lead to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Osteomyelitis: The patient has gangrenous foot and digits, which have significantly worsened over the last year. Osteomyelitis is suspected in the right foot, but other sites of infection cannot be ruled out. This could lead to further spread of infection and tissue necrosis if not appropriately managed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, requiring the use of pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Prolonged hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is confused and has delirium, which may worsen without appropriate management of underlying causes such as infection, hypotension, and pain.
5. End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD requiring HD. His current condition may require changes in dialysis modality or frequency due to hypotension requiring pressors.
6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF). There is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Gangrenous Extremities: The patient's gangrenous foot and digits may require amputation, but surgical candidacy may be limited due to recent NSTEMIs and decline for revascularization.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia, indicating the need for careful monitoring and adjustment of insulin or other medications.
9. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has elevated phosphate levels, which may require phosphate binders to manage in the setting of ESRD.
10. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension needs to be managed cautiously in the setting"
