   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and recent hip partial replacement. He presents with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left lower extremity edema, and left hip/knee pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has difficulty maintaining oxygen saturation. He is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has a dilated thoracic aorta on chest X-ray. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab results are within normal range. The patient has a history of diabetes and schizophrenia, and there are concerns about possible hip dislocation and congestive heart failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia and may be at risk for further infections due to his compromised immune system.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient's elevated JVP and edema suggest possible heart failure. Further cardiac evaluation is needed.
3. Hip dislocation: The patient's left leg appears shortened and externally rotated, raising suspicion of a hip dislocation.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's leg edema and elevated CK levels may indicate DVT, which needs to be ruled out.
5. Diabetic complications: The patient has a history of diabetes, and his current condition may increase the risk of hyperglycemia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a nursing home resident with multiple comorbidities, including COPD, schizoaffective disorder, and dementia. The patient was admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status and subsequent deterioration in respiratory function. 

Key findings from the note include:

1. The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypotension, with blood pressures in the 80s, requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.
2. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and has been started on diltiazem for rate control.
3. The patient's oxygen saturation has been difficult to maintain, but improved with positioning and the use of BiPAP.
4. There are concerns about a possible hip dislocation, with the left leg appearing shortened and externally rotated. A plain AP film was normal, but a lateral x-ray is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Orthopedics were consulted last night.
5. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and signs of renal dysfunction.
6. The patient has a healthcare-associated pneumonia, likely due to MRSA, GNR, and typical CAP pathogens. Antibiotics have been initiated, and follow-up chest x-rays will be necessary.
7. The patient has congestive heart failure with an unknown ejection fraction. There are signs of volume overload, limiting further fluid resuscitation efforts.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with multiple chronic medical problems, currently experiencing respiratory distress. He has a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, COPD, schizoaffective disorder, and hip arthroplasty. The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and crackles in the basilar region of the chest suggest a possible pneumonia. It is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could indicate delirium, which can be caused by various factors, including infection.
3. Externally rotated left hip: The patient's externally rotated left leg may be a sign of hip dislocation, which is concerning and requires further evaluation and possible surgical intervention.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, and rate control is being achieved with diltiazem. If blood pressure is an issue, digoxin loading may be considered.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and the respiratory distress could be due to an exacerbation of the condition. Bronchodilators are being used for management.
6. Schizoaffective disorder: The patient's psychiatric condition requires management of his home medications when feasible.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and recent hip partial replacement. He presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left leg edema, and left hip/knee pain. The patient has multiple medical complications, including possible pneumonia, congestive heart failure, COPD exacerbation, hip dislocation, DVT, elevated CK levels, hyperglycemia, and schizoaffective disorder. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still experiencing altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient may have a healthcare-acquired pneumonia, which needs to be covered with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient shows signs of CHF with an elevated JVP and requires close monitoring of fluid balance.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD is worsening, and bronchodilators should be continued.
4. Hip Dislocation: There is a possibility of a hip dislocation, and further evaluation and management are needed.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's left leg edema and elevated CK levels raise concerns for DVT, and an ultrasound has been ordered to rule out this condition.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes, and his blood glucose levels need to be monitored and managed with insulin sliding scale"

   cancer and PSA 279.9.
   .          Consult PCP regarding management of patient
s prostate
   cancer.
   Externally rotated hip.  LLE shortened and externally rotated.  No

   chronic per ortho.
   LLE edema
 No clot.  DDx includes venous insufficiency, CHF (although
   worse on left).
   Elevated CK
 [**Month (only) 60**] be due to traumatic muscle injury in the setting of a

He presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left leg edema, and left hip/knee pain. Imaging studies revealed pneumonia, a large thoracic aortic aneurysm, and multiple blastic bone lesions. The patient initially required non-invasive respiratory support but has improved and is now off respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient presented with altered mental status, which could be due to delirium in the setting of infection or a possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Neurological consultation has been requested, and frequent neurologic checks are planned. A head MRI may be considered pending neurological evaluation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and rate control has been achieved with diltiazem and digoxin. Digoxin has been chosen to improve both rate control and cardiac output. Maintenance dose of digoxin will be started from tomorrow.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has healthcare-acquired pneumonia, and coverage for MRSA, GNR, and typical CAP pathogens is being provided with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin. Vancomycin dose will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and a recent hip partial replacement. He presents with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left lower extremity edema, and left hip/knee pain. The patient was transported to the CT scan for further evaluation, but no contrast was used due to a remote history of iodine allergy. An ultrasound was performed to check for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), a heart rate of 101 bpm (normal range 87-118 bpm), a blood pressure of 97/71 mmHg (normal range 76/50-120/77 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (normal range 13-28 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, normal platelet count, and normal creatinine levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate elevated troponin T, low TCO2, and glucose levels within normal range.

He presents with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left leg edema, and left hip/knee pain. The patient was transported to the CT scanner for non-contrast imaging due to concerns about iodine allergy. His respiratory status has improved, but he remains hypoxic. He has a history of unknown allergies to lithium and iodine. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/71 mmHg to 92/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient is on multiple medications, including digoxin, famotidine, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and others. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated troponin T level, and abnormal blood gas values. Imaging studies reveal new posterior left upper lobe consolidation and posterior right upper lobe ground glass opacity suggestive of pneumonia, as well as multiple blastic bone lesions concerning for metastatic prostate cancer. The patient's mental status has improved with neuro checks every four hours. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium, especially considering his recent"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with multiple chronic medical problems, including schizoaffective disorder, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and metastatic prostate cancer. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by pneumonia. The patient's mental status has improved, but he still has expressive aphasia. Other concerns include externally rotated left hip, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, hypovolemia, COPD, and metastatic prostate cancer. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is ready for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress due to pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress is already being managed with non-invasive ventilation and antibiotics. However, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if not properly monitored and treated.

2. Externally rotated left hip: Although the CT scan reassured that there is no dislocation, there is still a concern for hip dislocation or fracture. This could lead to further complications such as non-union, infection, or pressure ulcers.

3. Altered mental status and expressive aphasia: The patient's improved mental status is a positive sign, but the presence of expressive aphasia indicates potential communication difficulties. This may affect the patient's ability to express his needs and wishes, potentially leading to miscommunication and suboptimal care.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient"

   follow commands.  However, he will not produce speech other than
Hello.
  This is concerning for expressive aphasia.
   o         We will discuss with ortho whether his prosthesis would
   contraindicate MRI.
   o         Infection can certainly contribute and may be the main cause.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with multiple chronic medical problems, including schizoaffective disorder, COPD, metastatic prostate cancer, atrial fibrillation, and hypovolemia. He presents with respiratory distress and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely caused by MRSA, GNR, and typical CAP pathogens. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been started on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin. 

The patient's mental status has improved, but he still experiences expressive aphasia. He is also at risk for dislocation of his left hip, which will require orthopedic input. His atrial fibrillation seems to be better controlled with digoxin, and his hypovolemia has been addressed. 

The patient has a history of schizoaffective disorder and will resume home medications when feasible. He also has metastatic prostate cancer, which will be discussed with his primary care physician. 

The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition via nasogastric tube, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures such as boots for DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blockers, and VAP prevention. 

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is expected to remain in the ICU for further management."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, and hip partial replacement. He presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left lower extremity edema, and left hip/knee pain. Imaging studies revealed pneumonia, a large thoracic aortic aneurysm, and multiple blastic bone lesions. The patient initially required non-invasive respiratory support but has improved and is now off respiratory support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status - likely delirium due to infection. Neurology does not believe there is a new cerebrovascular accident (CVA), so an MRI can be held.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - controlled initially with diltiazem, then with digoxin. Continue digoxin for rate control.
3. Pneumonia - cover MRSA, GNR, typical CAP pathogens with vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and azithromycin. Stop azithromycin after a 5-day course.
4. Congestive heart failure - use digoxin to support pressure.
5. Blastic bone lesions - likely metastasis from prostate cancer. Consult PCP regarding management of patient's prostate cancer.
6. Externally rotated hip - chronic external rotation likely due to orthopedic issues.
7. Left lower extremity edema - no"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, and hip partial replacement. He presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left lower extremity edema, and left hip/knee pain. Imaging studies revealed pneumonia, a large thoracic aortic aneurysm, and multiple blastic bone lesions. The patient initially required non-invasive respiratory support but has since improved and is off respiratory support. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of improvement followed by deterioration. Delirium is likely due to infection, but other causes such as CVA should also be considered, although a normal non-contrast CT has been performed. Neurological checks are being conducted every four hours.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has atrial fibrillation but is not currently on anticoagulation. Digoxin has been initiated for rate control and to improve cardiac output and renal perfusion. Monitoring of the ECG is ongoing.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has healthcare-acquired pneumonia. Coverage for MRSA, GNR, and typical CAP pathogens with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin has been started. Van"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo M with COPD, Afib, prostate cancer, thoracic aneurysm, s/p hip
   partial replacement, presented on [**2166-9-9**] with altered mental status,
   tachycardia, hypoxemia, LLE edema, and left hip/knee pain.  Imaging
   studies revealed pneumonia, large thoracic aortic aneurysm, and
   multiple blastic bone lesions.  The patient initially required
   non-invasive respiratory support but his respiratory status has
   improved, and he has been off of respiratory support since the evening
   of [**2166-9-10**].
   Altered mental status
 Per nursing home, patient A&Ox3 without
   dementia at baseline.  Mental status has fluctuated from hour to hour
   and tends to be better in the afternoon.  For instance, yesterday
   afternoon, the patient was able to respond to simple commands and
   answer simple questions.  However, this morning, the patient
s mental
   status is less responsive, as he has been in the mornings during this
   hospitalization.  This is likely delirium in the setting of acute
   infection, although some features are strange such as patient
   apparent aphasia.  Neurology evaluated the patient yesterday and does
   not feel that he has aphasia or has had a CVA.
          Neuro checks Q4H.
   .          Avoid benzos and opioids.
   Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Patient not on anticoagulation.
   Patient
s PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 125**], [**Name (NI) 420**] and does not believe anticoagulation
   is a good idea given fall risk.  Rate initially controlled with
   diltiazem.  Switched to digoxin to improve BP, cardiac output, renal
   perfusion.  Rate control and BP good.
          Continue digoxin for rate control.
   .          Check digoxin level in a.m. [**2166-9-13**].
   .          Monitor ECG.
   Pneumonia
 Patient with healthcare-acquired (nursing home resident)
   pneumonia.  Breathing has improved.  Vancomycin dose decreased to 750
   mg Q12 hours at 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.
          Cover MRSA, GNR, typical CAP pathogens with vanco, zosyn,
   azithro.  Stop azithromycin after completion of 5-day course [**9-14**].  Last
   dose will be Saturday night/Sunday morning at midnight.  Stop vanco and
   Zosyn on [**9-17**] after completion of 8-day course.
          Follow blood cultures.  Blood cultures x 2 are pending.
   .          Check vancomycin level on Saturday morning.
   Congestive Heart Failure - EF unknown.  JVP persistently elevated.
          Continue digoxin to support pressure.
   COPD
 Moving well today.  No wheezes.
          Continue bronchodilators
 albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
          Change methylprednisolone 20 mg IV Q8H to prednisone 30 mg
   PO daily.
   .          Continue to taper
   steroids.
   Blastic bone lesions
 Likely metastasis given history of prostate
   cancer and PSA 279.9.  Will need to rule out spinal cord compression
   given lower extremity weakness.
   .          MRI spine to rule out cord compression.
   Externally rotated hip - LLE shortened and externally rotated.  No
   evidence of fracture of dislocation on CT.  External rotation can be a
   sign of flaccid paresis, although neuro felt lower extremity strength
   to be symmetric.  Will rule out spinal cord lesion with MRI as above.
   LLE edema
 No clot.  DDx includes venous insufficiency, CHF (although
   worse on left).
   Schizoaffective disorder - Speech and swallow evaluated yesterday.
   Felt patient could take crushed meds.  Restarted home psych meds
   yesterday.
   .           Changed Depakote to valproic acid given patient
s dietary
   restrictions to purees and crushed meds.
   .           olanzapine
   Back pain
 [**Month (only) 60**] be a result of known metastatic disease.  Would avoid
   opioids given patient
s delirium, although patient may need more than
   just Tylenol if he develops significant pain.
   .           Tylenol for pain management.
   Hypothyroidism - Levothyroxine

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo M with COPD, Afib, prostate cancer, thoracic aneurysm, s/p hip
   partial replacement, presented on [**2166-9-9**] with altered mental status,
   tachycardia, hypoxemia, LLE edema, and left hip/knee pain.  Imaging
   studies revealed pneumonia, large thoracic aortic aneurysm, and
   multiple blastic bone lesions.  The patient initially required
   non-invasive respiratory support but his respiratory status has
   improved, and he has been off of respiratory support since the evening
   of [**2166-9-10**].
   Altered mental status
 Per nursing home, patient A&Ox3 without
   dementia at baseline.  Mental status has fluctuated from hour to hour
   and tends to be better in the afternoon.  For instance, yesterday
   afternoon, the patient was able to respond to simple commands and
   answer simple questions.  However, this morning, the patient
s mental
   status is less responsive, as he has been in the mornings during this
   hospitalization.  This is likely delirium in the setting of acute
   infection, although some features are strange such as patient
   apparent aphasia.  Neurology evaluated the patient yesterday and does
   not feel that he has aphasia or has had a CVA.
          Neuro checks Q4H.
   .          Avoid benzos and opioids.
   Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Patient not on anticoagulation.
   Patient
s PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 125**], [**Name (NI) 420**] and does not believe anticoagulation
   is a good idea given fall risk.  Rate initially controlled with
   diltiazem.  Switched to digoxin to improve BP, cardiac output, renal
   perfusion.  Rate control and BP good.
          Continue digoxin for rate control.
   .          Check digoxin level in a.m. [**2166-9-13**].
   .          Monitor ECG.
   Pneumonia
 Patient with healthcare-acquired (nursing home resident)
   pneumonia.  Breathing has improved.  Vancomycin dose decreased to 750
   mg Q12 hours at 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.
          Cover MRSA, GNR, typical CAP pathogens with vanco, zosyn,
   azithro.  Stop azithromycin after completion of 5-day course.  Last
   dose will be Saturday night/Sunday morning at midnight.  Stop vanco and
   Zosyn on [**9-17**] after completion of 8-day course.
          Follow blood cultures.  Blood cultures x 2 are pending.
   .          Check vancomycin level on Saturday morning.
   Congestive Heart Failure - EF unknown.  JVP persistently elevated.
          Continue digoxin to support pressure.
   COPD
 Moving well today.  No wheezes.
          Continue bronchodilators
 albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
          Change methylprednisolone 20 mg IV Q8H to prednisone 30 mg
   PO daily.
   .          Continue to taper steroids.
   Blastic bone lesions
 Likely metastasis given history of prostate
   cancer and PSA 279.9.  Will need to rule out spinal cord compression
   given lower extremity weakness.
   .          MRI spine to rule out cord compression.
   Externally rotated hip - LLE shortened and externally rotated.  No
   evidence of fracture of dislocation on CT.  External rotation can be a
   sign of flaccid paresis, although neuro felt lower extremity strength
   to be symmetric.  Will rule out spinal cord lesion with MRI as above.
   LLE edema
 No clot.  DDx includes venous insufficiency, CHF (although
   worse on left).
   Schizoaffective disorder - Speech and swallow evaluated yesterday.
   Felt patient could take crushed meds.  Restarted home psych meds
   yesterday.
   .           Changed Depakote to valproic acid given patient
s dietary
   restrictions to purees and crushed meds.
   .           olanzapine
   Back pain
 [**Month (only) 60**] be a result of known metastatic disease.  Would avoid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, thoracic aneurysm, and hip replacement. He presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left leg edema, and left hip/knee pain. Imaging studies revealed pneumonia, a large thoracic aortic aneurysm, and multiple blastic bone lesions. The patient initially required non-invasive respiratory support but has improved and been off respiratory support since the evening of 9/10.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status - likely delirium in the setting of acute infection.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - patient not on anticoagulation.
3. Congestive heart failure - elevated JVP, possible fall risk.
4. Pneumonia - healthcare-acquired (nursing home resident) pneumonia.
5. Blastic bone lesions - likely metastasis from prostate cancer.
6. Lower extremity weakness - possible spinal cord compression.
7. Left leg edema - no clot, differential diagnosis includes venous insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and other causes.
8. Back pain - likely due to known metastatic disease.
9. Hypothyroidism - patient requires levothyroxine.
10. Delirium - patient has fluctuating mental status and difficulty following commands.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including COPD, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, thoracic aneurysm, and a history of hip partial replacement. He presented with altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, left lower extremity edema, and left hip/knee pain. Imaging studies revealed pneumonia, large thoracic aortic aneurysm, and multiple blastic bone lesions. The patient required non-invasive respiratory support initially but has since improved and is off respiratory support. He continues to have fluctuating mental status, likely due to delirium secondary to acute infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient is not currently on anticoagulation despite having atrial fibrillation. His PCP does not believe anticoagulation is a good idea due to fall risk. Rate control has been achieved with digoxin, and digoxin levels should be monitored. The ECG should also be monitored.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has healthcare-acquired pneumonia. Coverage for MRSA, GNR, and typical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pathogens is being provided with vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and azithromycin.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a femoral neck fracture. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate ranging from 72 to 101 beats per minute, blood pressure between 108/77 mmHg and 118/88 mmHg, respiratory rate between 18 and 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on face tent.

The patient has received various medications, including heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's blood glucose levels have been monitored and are within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is elevated, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, ruling out acute myocardial infarction.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to his altered mental status and inability to assess certain vital signs such as peripheral pulses and skin condition. Neurologic examination was not performed.

The patient's overall condition is complicated by several factors, including"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with multiple chronic medical problems, including respiratory distress. He has been improving and appears to have had pneumonia and possibly COPD. He is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin. The patient's altered mental status has been waxing and waning, and it is more consistent with delirium rather than a CVA. He is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is better controlled with digoxin than with diltiazem infusion. His COPD is improving, and he will be weaned off steroids and continue with bronchodilators. He has schizoaffective disorder, metastatic prostate cancer, and a DNR/DNI status. He also has an externally rotated left hip, which was evaluated by CT and orthopedics but deemed benign. The patient is receiving ICU care, including advanced diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. He is also being monitored for VAP. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be transferred to the floor."
