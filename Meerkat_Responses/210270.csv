   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Pt is a pleasant 76 yo M w/ PMHx of CAD s/p MI w/ LV aneurysm, EF
   25-30% by pt report, NIDDM, TIMI score [**6-16**], who presents from an
   outside hospital after episode of chest/abdominal pressure,
   diaphoresis, dyspnea, with positive cardiac enzymes, and no ST
   elevations, consistent with NSTEMI.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt currently chest pain free, no new ST elevations or
   other EKG findings to suggest acute MI. No need for emergent
   revascularization or lysis at this time. Plan for diagnostic cath on
   Monday (today) if Pt continues to be hemodynamically stable, at which
   point can eval for percutaneous intervention vs potential CABG. If
   hemodynamically unstable or EKG changes concerning for evolving acute
   MI can activate cath lab.  Remained asymptomatic and Hemodynamically
   stable on [**2151-10-24**].

   - Continue integrillin
   - Maintain chest pain free using nitro, morphine PRN
    .
   # PUMP: Pt reports hx of CHF w/ EF of 25-30% although could not find
   records of this. Only ECHO is from [**2130**] w/ EF > 55%. Pt sx likely w/ a
   component of CHF as he experienced considerable relief w/ lasix, and
   was found to have CXR w/ pulmonary edema. At the moment Pt does not
   appear clinically volume overloaded.  Evidence of significant, chronic
   LV aneurysm on CXR, ECG, likely contributing to systolic dysfunction.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular aneurysm, and reduced ejection fraction (25-30%). He presents with symptoms consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), including chest pressure, diaphoresis, and dyspnea. The patient's cardiac enzymes are positive, indicating myocardial injury.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, no murmurs, and dry inspiratory rales at the bases of the lungs.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin T levels, elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count are within normal limits. Other laboratory values such as electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests are also within normal limits.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. The plan for revascularization has been deferred to Monday, pending further evaluation. The patient's medication regimen includes atorvastatin, carved"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular aneurysm, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents with chest and abdominal pressure, diaphoresis, dyspnea, and positive cardiac enzymes. He was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30% and a high TIMI score of 6-16.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is currently chest pain-free, with no new ST elevations or other EKG findings to suggest acute MI. No emergent revascularization or lysis is needed at this time. A diagnostic catheterization is planned for Monday if the patient remains hemodynamically stable, to evaluate for percutaneous intervention versus potential coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). If the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable or shows EKG changes concerning for evolving acute MI, the cath lab should be activated.

Medications:
- Continue ASA 81 mg qD
- Continue Plavix 75 mg
- Holding home crestor, starting atorvastatin 80 mg
- PRN oxygen, nitro, morphine
- Continue Carvedilol
- Continue integrillin
- Maintain chest pain-free using nitro, morphine PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular aneurysm, and diabetes mellitus. He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have severe three-vessel disease (3VD) on cardiac catheterization. The patient is being prepared for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 104/48 mmHg and heart rate of 91 bpm. He has mild pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and CT scan, but no evidence of pericardial effusion or mediastinal hematoma. The patient is currently on heparin drip, and his blood glucose levels are well-controlled.

Assessment and Plan:
- Coronaries: The patient is chest pain-free and hemodynamically stable. He has severe 3VD and is being prepped for CABG. Medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol, and thallium viability study.
- Pump: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25-30%. He is currently experiencing symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure, including considerable relief with Lasix and evidence of chronic left ventricular aneurysm on imaging. Medications include coreg, eplerenone, vals"

The recent trans-thoracic echo showed left ventricular cavity enlargement with inferior/inferolateral and apical aneurysms, along with a probable mural thrombus in the inferior aneurysm. Moderate mitral regurgitation and a low ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30% were also noted. Additionally, the cardiac catheterization revealed severe three-vessel disease (3VD), with occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA), 80-90% proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and 80-90% stenosis at the origin of the circumflex artery (Cx). The patient is being prepped for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). These findings indicate a high risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or further myocardial ischemia.

2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema with underlying emphysema. The CT chest confirmed mild pulmonary edema superimposed on severe emphysema, particularly in the lung apices. This combination of conditions increases the risk of respiratory infections,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and prostate cancer. He presented to the ICU with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon admission, he was found to have a left ventricular cavity enlargement with inferior/inferolateral and apical aneurysms, as well as a probable mural thrombus in the inferior aneurysm. There was also moderate mitral regurgitation and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%.

Cardiac catheterization revealed severe triple vessel disease with occluded right coronary artery, and significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery. Elevated left and right-sided filling pressures were noted, along with preserved cardiac index. The patient is being evaluated for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but a calcified inferior wall LV aneurysm is not in a good location for aneurysmectomy.

The patient experienced hemoptysis in the afternoon, which was initially thought to be due to post-nasal drip. However, given his LV aneurysm with probable mural thrombus, he was kept on heparin. Pulmonology consultation was sought, and the patient's chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema with underlying emphysema.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular aneurysm, and diabetes mellitus. He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed severe three-vessel disease (3VD) and the patient is being prepped for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 

The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30% and is experiencing symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF), which was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is currently on carvedilol, eplerenone, and valsartan. He also has a history of chronic left ventricular aneurysm, likely contributing to systolic dysfunction. 

The patient experienced hemoptysis in the afternoon, which was initially suspected to be epistaxis. However, a chest CT scan showed emphysematous changes with no clear source of bleeding. The patient's pulmonary function is being evaluated by pulmonary consultation. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, and brain natriuretic peptide, indicating myocardial injury and heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery bypass graft"
