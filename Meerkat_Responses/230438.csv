   hypotension. 8% bands in setting of leukopenia. unclear infectious
   etiology, ? cellulitis vs cholangitis vs other abdominal.

    - tylenol < 2g to control fevers
   # Abdominal Pain: epigastric pain and tense, diffusely tender abdomen,
   no rebound, +/- guarding, with watery diarrhea nonbloody and with
   elevated t bili and elevated lactate but low alk phos, no
   transaminitis, normal lipase. ct abd with enlarged gallbladder but no
   e/o cholecystitis but mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, ? AIDS
   cholangiopathy. possibly known complication of truvada with lactic

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events notable for cholecystostomy tube placement with resolution of
   abdominal pain, continued fever to 101.  Episode of chest pain with no
   ekg changes, resolved.  Weaning levophed gtt.
   BP 102/50s, P80 Sat 95% on RA.  I/O:24h +6.5  This AM -700.  Chole tube
   drainaged
   Exam notable for >3+ LE edema, erythema, diffuse, unchanged.  Abd soft
   +BS.  L chest wall tenderness.  CTA B/L RRR S1 S2.
   Labs notable for 10.6 <- 7.5 / Hct 35 <- 39 / Plt 213. 17% bands.
   Cr 1.2 <- 1.4, Bicarb 22.
   Vanc trough 9.3
   Meds include: Vanc / Zosyn, truvada, kaletra, PRN dilaudid.
   45M h/o HIV, Kaposi
s sarcoma / lymphoma felt to be in remission with
   ongoing lymphedema, septic shock and pressors d/t cholecystitis, s/p
   perc chole tube.  Improving.
   Agree with plan to continue antibiotics and chole tube drainage,
   continuing on HAART per ID.  Remains on both Vanc / Zosyn for concern
   of celluitis in addition to cholecystitis, reasonable to continue for
   now awaiting final cx data.  Weaning pressors, consider further fluid
   bolus PRN.  Remainder of plan as above.
   Pt is critically ill: CC time  35 min.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV and Kaposi sarcoma/lymphoma, currently on HAART therapy. He presented with neutropenic fevers, acute on chronic lower extremity edema, abdominal pain, and elevated bilirubin levels. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, and the source of infection is unclear, possibly cellulitis, cholangitis, or other abdominal issues. He underwent a cholecystostomy tube placement, which resolved his abdominal pain, but he continues to have a fever. The patient also experienced an episode of chest pain without EKG changes, which resolved on its own. His blood pressure remains low, and he requires norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Other vital signs include a heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's white blood cell count is 1.0 with 16% neutrophils, 8% bands, and 74% lymphocytes. He has widespread lower extremity edema, which is thought to be due to lymphedema from his history of lymphoma. Laboratory results show an elevated lactate level and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's condition is critically ill, and he requires aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of cholecystectomy, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis and cholangitis secondary to a bile duct injury during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 

The patient's vital signs show persistent fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, tachycardia with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 66/32 to 110/51 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 103 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein level of 35.0 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 2.5 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

The patient has multiple drains in place, including a cholangiocentric drain with significant output. The patient's abdominal pain has improved after the placement of the drain, but he continues to spike fevers despite receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV, currently on Truvada and Kaletra, and a past medical history of Kaposi's sarcoma of the inguinal lymph nodes with lymphedema in the lower extremities. He has a positive Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test and was treated with penicillin on [**5-23**]. The patient presents with neutropenic fevers, acute-on-chronic leg edema, abdominal pain and tenderness, elevated total bilirubin, and elevated lactate levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is hypotensive and has neutropenic fever. There is a possibility of cellulitis, cholangitis, or other abdominal infections. Levophed is being administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses are being given to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) above 10, and antibiotics have been started.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient has epigastric pain and a tense, diffusely tender abdomen. There is no rebound or guarding, and he has watery diarrhea. The patient has elevated total bilirubin and lactate levels, but low alkaline phosphatase, no transaminitis, and normal lipase. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen reveals an enlarged gallbladder"

   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV and Karposi lymphoma, presenting with neutropenic fevers, acute on chronic lower extremity edema, abdominal pain and tenderness, and elevated bilirubin levels. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to an unknown infectious etiology. He also has abdominal pain and tenderness, possibly due to AIDS cholangiopathy or lactic acidosis as a known complication of truvada. The patient's leukocyte count is low, indicating neutropenia. His vital signs show hypotension and fever. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of hypotension and fever indicates sepsis. If left untreated, it can progress to septic shock and organ failure.
2. AIDS Cholangiopathy: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and elevated bilirubin levels suggest the possibility of AIDS cholangiopathy. If not treated, this condition can lead to liver damage and complications.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate level indicates lactic acidosis, a known complication of truvada. If not addressed, lactic acidosis can cause metabolic acidosis and organ dysfunction.
4. Neutropenic Fever: The patient's low white blood cell count and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV and a low CD4 count, who presented with neutropenic fevers, acute-on-chronic leg edema, abdominal pain and tenderness, and elevated bilirubin levels. He has been diagnosed with sepsis and is currently receiving aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. His abdominal pain is thought to be due to AIDS cholangiopathy, possibly related to his medication, Truvada. The patient's neutropenia is also being investigated, with potential causes including lymphoma or medication side effects. He is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and others. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already developed sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and infection. Prompt and aggressive treatment is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Organ dysfunction: Due to his underlying immunocompromised state, the patient may be at risk of developing organ dysfunction, particularly in the liver and kidneys. Monitoring liver and kidney function is crucial.
3. AIDS cholangiopathy: This is a known complication of HIV infection and can lead to liver dysfunction and biliary obstruction. Further evaluation, such as ERCP/MRCP, may be necessary to confirm the"
