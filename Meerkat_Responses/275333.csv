   Assessment and Plan
   In brief this is a 74 year old man with history of HTN, COPD and CHF
   who is transfered for management of AF, decompenstated diastolic CHF
   and moderate MR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation: Apparently new onset since [**2128-10-14**],
   however his most recent ECG prior to this was in [**2119**]. Also pt is a
   poor historian. Likely precipitant of afib is CHF exacurbation.
   Alternative etiologies include thyroid dysfunction(normal function on
   OSH labs) and less likley infection. Currently on rate/rhythm control
   with BB, digoxin and amiodarone. Anticoagulated with heparin ggt (CHADS
   [**2-25**], note unclear h/o CVA).
   - continue rate/rhythm control(lopressor); transition to po regimen
   overnight
   - continue amiodarone loading
   - monitor digoxin level(1.2)
   - Heparin/warfarin s/p cardioversion
   - DCCV/w/TEE for further eval of MR in am
   -?wether anesthesia will come to CCU
   .
   # PUMP:Decompensated diastolic (and possibly systolic if 55% is true,
   with moderate MR <60 = systolic dysfunction) LV dysfunction, on
   presentation at OSH, now nearing euvolemia: The exact etiology of the
   exacurbation is not known. The most concerning precipitant is worsening
   mitral regurgitation, although this may be precipitated by  dietary or
   medication noncompliance or gut edema and poor absorbtion. TTE showed
   preserved systolic function. However, given his severe MR it is
   possible that his has systolic dysfunction as well (and the EF is
   underestimated by TTE since some of the flow is regurgitant). No
   baseline TTE available to determine progression of his LV dysfunction.
   Currently nearing euvolemia. His weight has improved by aprx 30 lb
   since initiation of furosemide ggt.
   - continue diuresis with furosemide 40mg [**Hospital1 7**]; transition to oral
   regimen tonight; if necessary would add metolazone.
   - monitor i/o (goal negative -1L), [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, check CXR on admission
   - afterload reduction goal SBP<120; continue BB and uptitrate as
   tolerated, captopril.
   .
   # VALVES: Mitral regurgitation: Most likely this is a chronic process
   vs. acute [**Hospital1 11251**] muscle rupture or flail leaflet, although no
   records available to support this. I suspect age relate change is the
   most likely etiology. A history of RHD is not reported. No evidence of
   ischemic disease at OSH to suggest acute MR [**First Name (Titles) 3415**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11251**] mm rupture,
   but he has not been evaluated in past.
   - plan for TEE in am to better eval MR given poor windows on TTE
   - consider c. catheterization to eval for CAD
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] c/s once MS clears
   .
   # CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD, EKG without evidence of ischemia
   current or prior.
   - plan for cardiac cath
   - check lipid panel, HBA1c to risk stratify.
   - continue aspirin, BB
   .
   # Delirium: Disoriented and combative in the setting of acute illness.
   Likely ICU delirium vs. toxic metabolic cause. Possibly medication
   induced. Unclear baseline mental status as lives alone and had poor
   grooming on admission at OSH.
   - regulate sleep/wake cycle
   - monitor metabolic and blood profiles
   - check RPR, B12, folate
   - haldol if needed for acute agitation, would avoid benzos if at all
   possible
   - PRN seroquel [**Doctor First Name **], avoid restraints

   # HTN: Blood pressure waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**].

   Assessment and Plan
   In brief this is a 74 year old man with history of HTN, COPD and CHF
   who is transfered for management of AF, decompenstated diastolic CHF
   and moderate MR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation: Apparently new onset since [**2128-10-14**],
   however his most recent ECG prior to this was in [**2119**]. Also pt is a
   poor historian. Likely precipitant of afib is CHF exacurbation.
   Alternative etiologies include thyroid dysfunction(normal function on
   OSH labs) and less likley infection. Currently on rate/rhythm control
   with BB, digoxin and amiodarone. Anticoagulated with heparin ggt (CHADS
   [**2-25**], note unclear h/o CVA).
   - continue rate/rhythm control; transition to po regimen overnight
   - monitor digoxin level
   - heparin to warfarin bridge if no additional invasive procedures
   - DCCV/w/TEE for further eval of MR in am
   .
   # PUMP:Decompensated diastolic (and possibly systolic) LV dysfunction,
   on presentation at OSH, now nearing euvolemia: The exact etiology of
   the exacurbation is not known. The most concerning precipitant is
   worsening mitral regurgitation, although this may be precipitated by
   dietary or medication noncompliance or gut edema and poor absorbtion.
   TTE showed preserved systolic function. However, given his severe MR it
   is possible that his has systolic dysfunction as well (and the EF is
   underestimated by TTE since some of the flow is regurgitant). No
   baseline TTE available to determine progression of his LV dysfunction.
   Currently nearing euvolemia. His weight has improved by aprx 30 lb
   since initiation of furosemide ggt.
   - continue diuresis with furosemide; transition to oral regimen
   tonight; if necessary would add metolazone.
   - monitor i/o (goal negative 500cc), [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, check CXR on admission
   - afterload reduction goal SBP<120; continue BB and uptitrate as
   tolerated, will add second [**Doctor Last Name **] ACEi tonight given BP room.
   - may consider stopping digoxin since he has diastolic dysfunction,
   will continue for now and check dig level.
   # VALVES: Mitral regurgitation: Most likely this is a chronic process
   vs. acute [**Doctor Last Name 11251**] muscle rupture or flail leaflet, although no
   records available to support this. I suspect age relate change is the
   most likely etiology. A history of RHD is not reported. No evidence of
   ischemic disease at OSH to suggest acute MR [**First Name (Titles) 3415**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11251**] mm rupture,
   but he has not been evaluated in past.
   - plan for TEE in am to better eval MR given poor windows on TTE
   - consider c. catheterization to eval for CAD
   - consider CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] c/s re MVR/percutanous interventions in am
   .
   # CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD, EKG without evidence of ischemia
   current or prior.
   - plan for cardiac cath
   - check lipid panel, HBA1c to risk stratify.
   - continue aspirin, BB
   .
   # Delirium: Disoriented and combative in the setting of acute illness.
   Likely ICU delirium vs. toxic metabolic cause. Possibly medication
   induced. Unclear baseline mental status as lives alone and had poor
   grooming on admission at OSH.
   - regulate sleep/wake cycle
   - monitor metabolic and blood profiles
   - check RPR, B12, folate
   - haldol if needed for acute agitation, would avoid benzos if at all
   possible
   - start seroquel [**Name (NI) **]
   - PT consult for OOB to chair
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressure waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**].
   - continue BB, uptitrate as tolerated
   - add ACEi - start with captopril and uptitrate as possible
   .
   # COPD: Stable

","The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was transferred for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), decompensated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). He is currently experiencing new-onset AF, which is likely precipitated by CHF exacerbation. The patient is being treated with rate/rhythm control medications including beta-blockers (BB), digoxin, and amiodarone. He is also anticoagulated with heparin due to a CHADS2 score.

The patient has decompensated diastolic (and possibly systolic) left ventricular dysfunction with moderate MR. The exact etiology of the exacerbation is not known, but worsening mitral regurgitation may be a concern. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed preserved systolic function, but given his severe MR, systolic dysfunction is possible. No baseline TTE is available to determine the progression of his LV dysfunction.

The patient's weight has improved by approximately 30 lbs since the initiation of furosemide. He is nearing euvolemia and will continue diuresis with furosemide, transitioning to an oral regimen tonight. If necessary, metolazone may be added. Fluid balance should be monitored, and electrolytes should be checked regularly.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with atrial fibrillation (AF), decompenstated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The most likely precipitant of AF is CHF exacerbation. The patient is on rate/rhythm control medication including beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone. He is also anticoagulated with heparin.

The patient has severe MR, which may be chronic rather than acute. There is no evidence of ischemic disease or papillary muscle rupture. TEE showed no intracardiac thrombus and revealed severe eccentric mitral regurgitation involving the partial posterior mitral leaflet.

The patient's delirium is likely due to acute illness or medication. His weight has improved since initiation of diuretic therapy. His blood pressure is being managed with beta-blockers and may require additional antihypertensive medication.

The patient's COPD is stable, and he will continue to receive nebulizers and oxygen as needed. He has a history of poor oral intake, so a speech and swallow consult has been ordered. Fluid restriction and heart-healthy low sodium diet are recommended.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Heart Failure: The patient's CHF is already Decompens"

   # RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation: Apparently new onset since [**2128-10-14**],

   with BB, digoxin and amiodarone. Anticoagulated with heparin gtt (CHADS
   2, note unclear h/o CVA).  S/P TEE and DCCV.
   - on PO metoprolol for rate-control

   mitral regurgitation, although this may be precipitated by  dietary or
   medication noncompliance or gut edema and poor absorbtion. TTE showed
   preserved systolic function. However, given his severe MR it is
   possible that his has systolic dysfunction as well (and the EF is
   underestimated by TTE since some of the flow is regurgitant). No
   baseline TTE available to determine progression of his LV dysfunction.
   Currently nearing euvolemia. His weight has improved by aprx 30 lb

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was transferred for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), decompensated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient is currently on rate/rhythm control with beta-blockers (BB), digoxin, and amiodarone. He is also anticoagulated with heparin. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and direct current cardioversion (DCCV).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Rhythm: The patient likely has new-onset AF, possibly due to CHF exacerbation. He is being managed with rate/rhythm control medications.
2. Pump: The patient has decompensated diastolic (and possibly systolic) left ventricular dysfunction with moderate MR. His LV dysfunction is being managed with diuretics, afterload reduction, and blood pressure control.
3. Valves: The patient has severe eccentric mitral regurgitation without evidence of acute papillary muscle rupture or flail leaflet. Chronic process of MR is suspected, and further evaluation for coronary artery disease (CAD) and potential cardiac catheterization is planned.
4. Coronaries: No prior history of CAD, EKG without evidence of ischemia. Cardiac cath"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), decompensated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). He has been on rate/rhythm control medications including beta-blockers (BB), digoxin, and amiodarone. He is also anticoagulated with heparin due to CHADS2 score. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and direct current cardioversion (DCCV). His current vital signs are stable, but he has been agitated and pulling at lines. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AF: The patient is experiencing new-onset atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and thromboembolism. He is already on anticoagulation therapy, but close monitoring for any signs of stroke or thrombus formation is necessary.
2. Decompensated Diastolic CHF: The patient has severe diastolic dysfunction, which may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output. Monitoring for these symptoms and adjusting diuretic therapy accordingly is essential.
3. Moderate MR: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation, which can lead to volume overload and symptoms of heart"

   Assessment and Plan
   In brief this is a 74 year old man with history of HTN, COPD and CHF
   who is transfered for management of AF, decompenstated diastolic CHF
   and moderate MR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation: Apparently new onset since [**2128-10-14**],
   however his most recent ECG prior to this was in [**2119**]. Also pt is a
   poor historian. Likely precipitant of afib is CHF exacurbation.
   Alternative etiologies include thyroid dysfunction(normal function on
   OSH labs) and, less likely, infection. Currently on rate/rhythm control
   with BB, digoxin and amiodarone. Anticoagulated with heparin gtt (CHADS
   2, note unclear h/o CVA).  S/P TEE and DCCV.
   - on PO metoprolol for rate-control
   - as patient is likely sufficiently loaded on amiodarone, switch to 200
   mg po qday
   - heparin/warfarin s/p cardioversion(warfarin pending decision re:
   cath/surgery)
   - D/C

   .
   # PUMP:Decompensated diastolic (and possibly systolic if 55% is true,
   with moderate MR <60 = systolic dysfunction) LV dysfunction, on
   presentation at OSH, now nearing euvolemia: The exact etiology of the
   exacerbation is not known. The most concerning precipitant is worsening
   mitral regurgitation, although this may be precipitated by  dietary or
   medication noncompliance or gut edema and poor absorbtion. TTE showed
   preserved systolic function. However, given his severe MR it is
   possible that his has systolic dysfunction as well (and the EF is
   underestimated by TTE since some of the flow is regurgitant). No
   baseline TTE available to determine progression of his LV dysfunction.
   Currently nearing euvolemia. His weight has improved by aprx 30 lb
   since initiation of furosemide ggt.
   - continue diuresis with furosemide 60mg PO daily; if necessary would
   add metolazone.
   - monitor i/o (goal negative -1L), [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - afterload reduction goal SBP<120; currently on BB, ACEI (lisinopril)

   # VALVES: Mitral regurgitation: Most likely this is a chronic process
   vs. acute papillary muscle rupture or flail leaflet, although no
   records available to support this.  A history of RHD is not reported.
   No evidence of ischemic disease at OSH to suggest acute MR [**First Name (Titles) 3415**]

   A1C-P
   - continue aspirin, BB, ACEI

   # Delirium: Disoriented and combative in the setting of acute illness.
   Likely ICU delirium vs. toxic metabolic cause. Possibly medication
   induced.  Patient lives alone and had poor grooming on admission at
   OSH.  Per sister, patient is independent at baseline.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation, decompensated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient's current condition shows improvement with the use of BIPAP, mental status clearance, and correction of free water deficit. He is being managed with rate/rhythm control medications, anticoagulation, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of stroke and worsen heart function.
2. Decompensated Diastolic CHF: The patient's heart failure is causing fluid accumulation and reduced cardiac output, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue.
3. Moderate Mitral Regurgitation: This condition can lead to further heart damage and complications like pulmonary edema.
4. Medication Reactions: With a history of penicillin allergies, there is a risk of adverse reactions to certain medications.
5. Delirium: The patient is disoriented and combative, possibly due to ICU delirium or medication-induced causes. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, self-removal of tubes or lines, and other complications.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was transferred for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), decompensated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). 

The patient's recent events include being somnolent all day with some carbon dioxide retention, improvement after being placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), clearing mental status throughout the day, and being oriented back to baseline. The patient also had a developing free water deficit, which was corrected by bolusing D5W. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/94 mmHg to 102/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on a ventilator. 

The patient's physical examination findings include normal general appearance, regular rapid regular rhythm, bibasilar diminished breath sounds, stable abdomen with slight tenderness, warm well-perfused extremities, and no peripheral edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the ICU for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), decompensated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 144/64 to 157/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His weight has improved by approximately 30 pounds since starting furosemide.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient's ECG showed new-onset AF, which is likely related to his CHF exacerbation. He is currently on rate/rhythm control medications including metoprolol, amiodarone, and digoxin. He is also anticoagulated with heparin.

The patient has decompenstated diastolic (and possibly systolic) LV dysfunction with moderate MR. The exact etiology of the exacerbation is not known, but worsening mitral regurgitation may be a contributing factor. TTE showed preserved systolic function, but given his"

   exacerbation is not known. The most concerning precipitant is worsening
   mitral regurgitation, although this may be precipitated by  dietary or

   preserved systolic function. However, given his severe MR it is
   possible that his has systolic dysfunction as well (and the EF is

   baseline TTE available to determine progression of his LV dysfunction.
   Currently nearing euvolemia. His weight has improved by aprx 30 lb

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), decompensated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Rhythm: The patient has new-onset AF, likely precipitated by CHF exacerbation. He is on rate/rhythm control with beta-blockers (BB), digoxin, and amiodarone. Anticoagulation with heparin is ongoing due to CHADS2 score and unclear history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

2. PUMP: The patient has decompensated diastolic (and possibly systolic) LV dysfunction with moderate MR. The exact etiology of the exacerbation is unknown, but worsening mitral regurgitation seems to be a concerning precipitant. TTE showed preserved systolic function, but given severe MR, systolic dysfunction might also be present. The patient is nearing euvolemia, and his weight has improved significantly since starting furosemide gtt. The plan includes switching diuresis regimen to furosemide 60 mg po qday, monitoring intake/output (I/O), and aiming for a negative fluid balance.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was transferred for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), decompensated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:
1. AF: The patient has new-onset AF, which may be precipitated by CHF exacerbation, thyroid dysfunction, or infection. He is currently on rate/rhythm control medications including beta-blockers (BB), digoxin, and amiodarone. Anticoagulation with heparin is ongoing.
2. Decompensated Diastolic CHF: The patient has diastolic (and possibly systolic) LV dysfunction. The exact etiology is not known, but worsening MR is a concerning precipitant. He is nearing euvolemia and his weight has improved since starting furosemide gtt.
3. Moderate MR: The patient has severe eccentric mitral regurgitation due to a partial posterior mitral leaflet. He is being considered for left heart catheterization (LHC) to evaluate for coronary artery disease (CAD). Surgery is not an option at this time due to altered mental status (AMS), hypercarbia, and deconditioning. Mitral valve clip placement may be considered as an"

   74 year old man with history of HTN, COPD and CHF who is transfered for
   management of AF, decompenstated diastolic CHF and moderate MR.

   # RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation: Apparently new onset since [**2128-10-14**],
   however his most recent ECG prior to this was in [**2119**]. Also pt is a
   poor historian. Likely precipitant of afib is CHF exacurbation.
   Alternative etiologies include thyroid dysfunction(normal function on
   OSH labs) and, less likely, infection. Currently on rate/rhythm control
   with BB, digoxin and amiodarone. Anticoagulated with heparin gtt (CHADS
   2, note unclear h/o CVA).  S/P TEE and DCCV.
   - on PO metoprolol for rate-control
   - continue amiodarone 200 mg po qday
   - heparin/warfarin s/p cardioversion(warfarin pending decision re:
   cath/surgery)
   .
   # PUMP:Decompensated diastolic (and possibly systolic if 55% is true,
   with moderate MR <60 = systolic dysfunction) LV dysfunction, on
   presentation at OSH, now nearing euvolemia: The exact etiology of the
   exacerbation is not known. The most concerning precipitant is worsening
   mitral regurgitation, although this may be precipitated by  dietary or
   medication noncompliance or gut edema and poor absorbtion. TTE showed
   preserved systolic function. However, given his severe MR it is
   possible that his has systolic dysfunction as well (and the EF is
   underestimated by TTE since some of the flow is regurgitant). No
   baseline TTE available to determine progression of his LV dysfunction.
   Currently nearing euvolemia. His weight has improved by aprx 30 lb
   since initiation of furosemide gtt.
   - switch diuresis regimen to to furosemide 60 mg po qday
   - monitor i/o (goal even to slightly negative), [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - afterload reduction goal SBP<120; currently on BB, ACEI (lisinopril)

   vs. acute papillary muscle rupture or flail leaflet, although no

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted for management of atrial fibrillation, decompenstated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/77 mmHg to 170/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, metoprolol, amiodarone, furosemide, lisinopril, aspirin, and a proton pump inhibitor. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. RHYTHM: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, likely precipitated by CHF exacerbation. He is currently on rate/rhythm control medications such as beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone. Anticoagulation with heparin is ongoing due to CHADS2 score.

2. PUMP: The patient has decompenstated diastolic"

   # PUMP:Decompensated diastolic (and possibly systolic if 55% is true,
   with moderate MR <60 = systolic dysfunction) LV dysfunction, on
   presentation at OSH, now nearing euvolemia: The exact etiology of the
   exacerbation is not known. The most concerning precipitant is worsening
   mitral regurgitation, although this may be precipitated by  dietary or
   medication noncompliance or gut edema and poor absorbtion. TTE showed
   preserved systolic function. However, given his severe MR it is
   possible that his has systolic dysfunction as well (and the EF is
   underestimated by TTE since some of the flow is regurgitant). No
   baseline TTE available to determine progression of his LV dysfunction.
   Currently nearing euvolemia. His weight has improved by aprx 30 lb
   since initiation of furosemide gtt.
   - switch diuresis regimen to to furosemide 60 mg po qday
   - monitor i/o (goal even to slightly negative), [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - afterload reduction goal SBP<120; currently on BB, ACEI (lisinopril)

   # VALVES: Mitral regurgitation: Most likely this is a chronic process
   vs. acute papillary muscle rupture or flail leaflet, although no
   records available to support this.  A history of RHD is not reported.
   No evidence of ischemic disease at OSH to suggest acute MR [**First Name (Titles) 3415**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 11268**]ary mm rupture, but he has not been evaluated in past.   TEE - No
   intracardiac thrombus seen. Partial posterior mitral leaflet with
   severe eccentric mitral regurgitation.
   - consider LHC to eval for CAD

   # CORONARIES: No prior history of CAD, EKG without evidence of ischemia

   A1C-5.9
   - continue aspirin, BB, ACEI

   # Delirium: Disoriented and combative in the setting of acute illness.
   Likely ICU delirium vs. toxic metabolic cause. Possibly medication
   induced.  Patient lives alone and had poor grooming on admission at
   OSH.  Per sister, patient is independent at baseline.

   - seroquel QHS, avoid restraints
   - monitor metabolic and blood profiles (possible high co2 retention
   55-60 pCO2 regularly)
 NIPPV if necessary
   - RPR, B12, folate WNL
   - haldol if needed for acute agitation, would avoid benzos if at all
   possible

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF).
- He was admitted for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), decompenstated diastolic CHF, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).
- The patient's most recent ECG prior to this was in 2019, and it is unclear whether he has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
- He is currently being treated with beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone for rate/rhythm control, and anticoagulated with heparin due to CHADS2 score.
- The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and direct current cardioversion (DCCV).
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 150/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient's weight has improved by approximately 30 pounds since the initiation of furosemide infusion.
- He is nearing euvolemia, with a goal of slightly negative intake/output balance.
- The patient's mitral valve is affected by severe eccentric mitral regurgitation, most likely a chronic process.
- No intracardiac thrombus was seen on TEE.
- The patient does not have a history of coronary artery disease, but an upcoming cardiac catheterization is planned.
- He also has delirium, which may be due to ICU delirium or medication-induced causes.
- The patient's blood pressure is waxing and waning, and his COPD is stable.
- He is on a heart-healthy low-sodium diet, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure symptoms due to diastolic dysfunction.
2. Development of cardiogenic shock if systolic dysfunction progresses.
3. Thromboembolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism due to atrial fibrillation and severe mitral regurgitation.
4. Acute exacerbation of COPD leading to respiratory failure.
5. Poor glycemic control due to diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia.
6. Infection or sepsis, especially considering the use of indwelling lines and potential for VAP.
7. Further decline in renal function and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Adverse effects from medications such as digoxin toxicity or amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.
9. Psychological disturbances such as persistent delirium or depression.
10. Poor wound healing or pressure ulcers due to immobility and malnutrition."
