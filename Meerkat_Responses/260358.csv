   Imaging: CXR [**2164-2-17**]: There has seen no interval change in the dilated
   tracheobronchial tree and dilated esophagus. The bibasilar
   consolidative changes of lung bases, which are superimposed on
   underlying interstitial lung disease, appear relatively unchanged.
   However, there are new foci of atelectasis within the right lung. No
   pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected.
   .
   Chest CTA [**2164-2-14**]:
   1. No pulmonary embolus.
   2. Progressed interstitial lung disease including honeycombing,
   cylindrical
   bronchiectasis, and diffuse ground-glass opacification predominantly in
   the
   lower lobes. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is a primary diagnostic
   consideration, with the possibility of superimposed aspiration
   suggested
   particularly in light of the patulous esophagus. Although unlikely
   given age, connective tissue disease may also present in this manner.
   It would be atypical however to present at this advanced age.
   3. Meidastinal adenopathy. Given relative dramatic sizes, felt out of
   proportion to be reactive nodes. Follow up CT in [**2-3**] months recommended
   to
   further evaluate.
   4. Large hiatal hernia with patulous esophagus. Contributes to
   possibility
   of superimposed aspiration.

   62M quadraparetic s/p transverse myelitis, sent to ICU from floor for
   hypoxia and closer monitoring/nursing care.
   .
   # Hypoxia: persistent despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia,
   ?aspiration especially as patient has patulous esophagus. Concerning
   for underlying IPF given chest CT findings. Unable to bronch so far due
   to easy desaturation to 60s. No PE per chest CTA. Less likely is
   pulmonary edema. Leukocytosis improving on abx.
   - continue vanco, pip-tazo, levoflox for now
   - sputum cx
   - consider elective intubation for bronch
   - hold off on diuresis for now
   .
   # LE edema: Pt with notable LE edema which by report is new. Bilateral,
   with some erythema which could represent venous stasis vs cellulitis.
   Echo showed preserved biventricular systolic function. LENIS showed DVT
   in left femoral vein.
   - vanco will cover cellulitis
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - gentle diuresis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old quadraplegic man who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress. He has a history of asthma, multiple pneumonia episodes, and transverse myelitis. The patient has allergies to aspirin, Samter's syndrome, erythromycin base, iodine, cottonseed oil, ceftazidime, clindamycin, and naloxone. He is currently on various medications including heparin sodium, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, methadone, and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 125/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. His heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a non-rebreather mask.

Physical examination findings include a thin and anxious appearance, normal pupillary examination, clear breath sounds, diminished peripheral pulses, and warm skin. Neurologic examination reveals the patient is unable to stand, and he does not respond to commands or assessable for orientation, movement, tone, or sensation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood chemistry reveals low sodium, potassium, magnesium, and albumin"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male who is paraplegic due to transverse myelitis and was admitted to the ICU from the floor for hypoxia and closer monitoring/nursing care. The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea. 

The patient has a history of anxiety, alteration in nutrition, pneumonia (presumably aspiration), hypoxemia, decubitus ulcer (present at admission), chronic pain, and a tib/fib fx sustained from falling off a wheelchair. 

Upon admission, the patient was transferred back to the ICU for frequent desaturation to the 60s requiring non-rebreather mask (NRB), no fever, and persistent leukocytosis. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin) and being monitored for now; will not electively intubate for bronchoscopy (for now). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 125/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool. 

The patient's physical examination reveals general appearance as thin and anxious, with eyes/conjunctiva being PERRL, head/ears/nose/throat being normocephalic, lymphatic system being within normal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who is paraplegic due to transverse myelitis. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and closer monitoring/nursing care. The patient has several medical conditions including pneumonia, aspiration, hypoxemia, decubitus ulcer (present at admission), chronic pain, and a history of anxiety, alteration in nutrition, and tib/fib fx.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory issues: The patient has persistent hypoxia despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, and there is concern for underlying IPF given the chest CT findings. The patient also has a patulous esophagus, making him more susceptible to aspiration. This increases the risk of respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema with some erythema, which could represent venous stasis or cellulitis. An echo showed preserved biventricular systolic function, but a LENIS revealed a DVT in the left femoral vein. This indicates a risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges.

3. Sacral decubiti: The patient has multiple sacral decubiti, which can become infected and lead to serious complications such as osteomyelitis.

4. Chronic pain management: The patient is on several medications for chronic pain management, including methadone and fentanyl. However,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of transverse myelitis. He was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea and new bilateral ground glass opacities on chest CT. The etiology of these findings is unclear, but they are concerning for possible interstitial lung disease (ILD) or aspiration.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be caused by various factors such as respiratory infections, pulmonary embolism, or ILD. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Pain: The patient has chronic lower back pain that is increasing in severity. The cause of the pain is unclear, but it may be related to his history of transverse myelitis or other underlying conditions. Constipation has also been mentioned as a complication.

3. GI issues: The patient requires evaluation for aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia and other respiratory complications. Increasing the dose of omeprazole to 40mg daily and discussing the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) are planned interventions.

4. DVT: The patient is on a heparin drip for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Monitoring and adjusting the anticoagulation therapy will be necessary.

5. Nutrition: The patient is currently nothing by mouth (NPO), indicating that he is not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of transverse myelitis. He was admitted with dyspnea and new bilateral ground glass opacities on chest CT. The etiology of his condition is unclear, but it is concerning for possible interstitial lung disease (ILD) or aspiration. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been fluctuating, and he requires supplemental oxygen. He also complains of severe pain and has a history of chronic lower back pain. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but he has an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count. His blood glucose level is low. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin, fentanyl, omeprazole, and others. He is unable to stand or walk due to muscle wasting. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the worsening dyspnea and severe pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a possible respiratory complication. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Pain: The patient's chronic lower back pain is worsening, which may be complicated by constipation. It is important to optimize the bowel regimen and consider imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT of the lumbar spine, once the patient is stable.
3. GI issues: The patient may have an evaluation of aspiration with a pH probe and an increased dose of omepr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of transverse myelitis. He was admitted with dyspnea and new bilateral ground glass opacities on chest CT. The etiology is unclear, but it is concerning for possible interstitial lung disease (ILD) versus aspiration. The patient's hypoxemia is being managed with oxygen therapy, and further investigations are planned to evaluate for eosinophils, ANCA, GBM, IgE, glucan, galactommanan, SPEP/UPEP, and sputum if obtainable. The decision to proceed with bronchoscopy has been deferred for another 24-48 hours.

The patient also experiences chronic lower back pain, which is increasing in severity. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely complicated by constipation. To address this, the bowel regimen will be improved, and an evaluation with MRI or CT of the lumbar spine will be considered when the patient is stable from a pulmonary standpoint. A geriatric-psych consult has been requested for behavior issues.

In terms of gastrointestinal concerns, the patient will need an evaluation of aspiration, and a pH probe is planned. The dose of omeprazole has been increased to 40mg daily, and the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) will be discussed with the patient, considering his history of sinus surgery.

The patient is currently on a heparin drip for deep vein"

   Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress
   24 Hour Events:
   - PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] called: suggests CPAP trial if possible but thinks
   patient will be unlikely to tolerate mask unless Clonazepam loaded (pt
   states he's tolerated in the past for approximately 30 seconds); agrees
   that intubation may not be helpful for longterm goals but thinks PEG
   may be necessary and that family would agree
   - Palliative / Pain consult: suggest scheduled Alprazolam 0.125 Q4H (pt
   may refuse); Fentanyl 12.5-25mcg IV q4H (pt may refuse); contact Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] and see if he will be able to visit patient in hospital, also need
   to clarify if longterm goals have been discussed as outpatient with
   family
   - Geriatrics consult: Would recommend Celexa instead of Wellbutrin,
   schedule alprazolam, contact PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CBC with diff obtain: no eosiniophilia or significant change
   - NGT not placed given h/o nasal surgery
   - PEG not pursued given tenuous respiratory status
   - Anti-GBM, SPEP, UPEP sent
   - Pt taking minimal pos, changed po Alprazolam to IV Ativan
   - Medications changed to IV for less po dosing: Synthroid, PPI
   - Started refusing po anxiolytics; given Ativan 0.5mg IV x 2
   - Per discussion with family & patient, will change code status to
   DNR/DNI as patient would never want a trach and his functional status
   is already poor; if no hope for improved functional status, would

","Summary:
The patient is a 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, allergies, and previous surgeries. The patient's family has discussed the possibility of palliative care and pain management. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI due to poor functional status and preference for home hospice if no hope for improved functional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and pneumonia may worsen, leading to further deterioration of respiratory function.
2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the lower extremities due to immobility and prolonged bed rest.
3. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient already has a decubitus ulcer present at admission, which may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Ineffective Coping and Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety and ineffective coping mechanisms, which can contribute to increased stress and potential complications.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels may decrease, indicating inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues.
6. Chronic Pain: The patient is suffering from chronic pain, which can impact overall well-being and recovery.
7. Malnutrition: The patient may be at risk of malnutrition due to alteration in nutrition and inadequate intake.
8. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient is at risk of aspiration pneumonia due to impaired swallowing and"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and closer monitoring. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. 

The patient has a history of paraplegia due to transverse myelitis and has been experiencing persistent hypoxia despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. The concern for underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is raised due to chest CT findings. The patient's leukocytosis is improving on antibiotics. 

The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema with some erythema, which could represent venous stasis or cellulitis. An echocardiogram showed preserved biventricular systolic function. The patient also has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left femoral vein. 

Additionally, the patient has multiple sacral decubiti, which were treated with levofloxacin as an outpatient and are scheduled for a plastics evaluation. The patient sustained a tib/fib fracture from falling from a wheelchair, which was not surgically treated. 

The patient is on several medications for chronic pain management, including methadone and fenatyl. 

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include: 
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia and respiratory distress indicate a high risk of respiratory"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU from the floor for hypoxia and closer monitoring. He has a history of paraplegia due to transverse myelitis. The patient has persistent hypoxia despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, and there are concerns about underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis given the chest CT findings. The patient is not producing sputum, making it difficult to obtain a sputum culture. He has been adamant about being do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI). The patient also has bilateral lower extremity edema with erythema, which could represent venous stasis or cellulitis. An echocardiogram showed preserved biventricular systolic function, and a leg ultrasound revealed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left femoral vein. The patient has multiple sacral decubitus ulcers and a tibial/fibular fracture sustained from a fall while using a wheelchair. He is on several medications, including methadone and fentanyl, for chronic pain management. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia despite antibiotics suggests a possible underlying condition such as interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's poor respiratory status may lead to respiratory failure if"

   Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress
   24 Hour Events:
   - PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] called: suggests CPAP trial if possible but thinks
   patient will be unlikely to tolerate mask unless Clonazepam loaded (pt
   states he's tolerated in the past for approximately 30 seconds); agrees
   that intubation may not be helpful for longterm goals but thinks PEG
   may be necessary and that family would agree
   - Palliative / Pain consult: suggest scheduled Alprazolam 0.125 Q4H (pt
   may refuse); Fentanyl 12.5-25mcg IV q4H (pt may refuse); contact Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] and see if he will be able to visit patient in hospital, also need
   to clarify if longterm goals have been discussed as outpatient with
   family
   - Geriatrics consult: Would recommend Celexa instead of Wellbutrin,
   schedule alprazolam, contact PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CBC with diff obtain: no eosiniophilia or significant change
   - NGT not placed given h/o nasal surgery
   - PEG not pursued given tenuous respiratory status
   - Anti-GBM, SPEP, UPEP sent
   - Pt taking minimal pos, changed po Alprazolam to IV Ativan
   - Medications changed to IV for less po dosing: Synthroid, PPI
   - Started refusing po anxiolytics; given Ativan 0.5mg IV x 2
   - Per discussion with family & patient, will change code status to
   DNR/DNI as patient would never want a trach and his functional status
   is already poor; if no hope for improved functional status, would
   prefer home with hospice

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with several medical conditions including transverse myelitis, Samter's syndrome, a recent leg fracture, and frequent urinary tract infections. The patient was admitted with shortness of breath and diffuse lung parenchymal infiltrates. He is currently in acute respiratory distress and requires oxygenation through a non-rebreather mask.

The patient has been on extensive antibiotic treatment (Vanc/zosyn/levaquin) for presumed aspiration but continues to experience respiratory distress. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI). Due to the patient's DNR/DNI status, more invasive testing such as bronchoscopy has not been pursued.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are within normal limits.

The patient's current medical complications include ineffective coping (anxiety), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, chronic pneumonia, hypoxemia, decubitus ulcer (present at admission), chronic pain, and diffuse parenchymal lung disease.

The plan includes completing treatment for pneumonia, starting a trial of steroids for possible"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with shortness of breath as the chief complaint. The patient has a history of multiple allergies, including reactions to medications such as erythromycin, clindamycin, and ceftazidime. The patient has received various antibiotics over the past few days, including piperacillin, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's review of systems shows fatigue, weight loss, dry mouth, edema, dyspnea, anemia, coagulopathy, and agitation. The vital signs indicate a heart rate within normal limits, blood pressure slightly elevated, respiratory rate on the higher end of normal, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on respiratory support with a non-rebreather mask and has an ABG result of ///25.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin and anxious, with poor dentition. There are no abnormalities noted in the lymphatic system, but cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. Peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Respiratory examination shows wheezes and rhonchi, indicating potential pulmonary issues. The abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present, but the patient is unable to stand due to muscle wasting. Skin assessment was not performed, but the patient has ulceration present at admission. Neurologic examination was not fully assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count,"

   # Hypoxia: persistent despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia,
   ?aspiration especially as patient has patulous esophagus. Concerning
   for underlying IPF given chest CT findings. Unable to bronch so far due
   to easy desaturation to 60s. No PE per chest CTA. Less likely is
   pulmonary edema. Leukocytosis improving on abx.
   - continue vanco, pip-tazo, levoflox for now
   - sputum cx (not currently producing sputum)
   - consider elective intubation for bronch but given pt adamantly DNI
   given possible need for trach, no bronch; also bronch would be
   difficult given desaturations

   # Hypoxia: persistent despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia,
   ?aspiration especially as patient has patulous esophagus. Concerning
   for underlying IPF given chest CT findings. Unable to bronch so far due
   to easy desaturation to 60s. No PE per chest CTA. Less likely is
   pulmonary edema. Leukocytosis improving on abx.
   - continue vanco, pip-tazo, levoflox for now
   - sputum cx (not currently producing sputum)
   - consider elective intubation for bronch but given pt adamantly DNI
   given possible need for trach, no bronch; also bronch would be
   difficult given desaturations
   - steroids (Solumedrol 60mg IV QD)
   - some coughing over last 24H, try to obtain sputum sample
   - CXR this AM
   # LE edema: Pt with notable LE edema which by report is new. Bilateral,
   with some erythema which could represent venous stasis vs cellulitis.
   Echo showed preserved biventricular systolic function. LENIS showed DVT
   in left femoral vein.
   - vanco will cover cellulitis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who is paraplegic and has a history of transverse myelitis. He was admitted to the ICU from the floor for hypoxia and closer monitoring/nursing care. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to chronic pneumonia and aspiration. There is concern for underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) given the chest CT findings. The patient's persistent hypoxia is not improving despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, and there is a concern for potential pulmonary edema. 

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a DVT in the left femoral vein, as evidenced by the use of heparin gtt and an Echo showing preserved biventricular systolic function.

3. Sacral decubitus ulcers: The patient has multiple sacral decubitus ulcers that require ongoing wound care and a plastics consult.

4. Tibia/fibula fracture: The patient sustained a tibia/fibula fracture from a fall and did not undergo surgical treatment. The fracture is being managed with a boot and orthopedic pain management.

5. Chronic pain management: The patient is on several medications, including methadone and fentanyl, for chronic pain management. This should be done cautiously due to the patient's respiratory status. A palliative care"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current health condition and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and pneumonia due to aspiration. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT), Lower Extremity: The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the lower extremities. If a clot were to dislodge and travel to the lungs, it could cause a potentially life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism.

3. Decubitus Ulcer (Present at Admission): The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which is a pressure sore commonly seen in bedridden patients. This can worsen and lead to infection or even gangrene if not properly managed.

4. Anxiety and Ineffective Coping: The patient is experiencing anxiety and ineffective coping mechanisms, which may contribute to their overall stress and worsen their health outcomes.

5. Chronic Pain: The patient is dealing with chronic pain, which can be managed but not completely resolved. It is essential to address and control the pain to improve the patient's comfort and well-being.

6. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis, an infection of the skin and underlying tissues. If left untreated or poorly managed, it can spread and lead to serious systemic complications.

   # Hypoxia: persistent despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia,
   ?aspiration especially as patient has patulous esophagus. Concerning
   for underlying IPF given chest CT findings. Unable to bronch so far due
   to easy desaturation to 60s. No PE per chest CTA. Less likely is
   pulmonary edema. Leukocytosis improving on abx. Did consider elective
   intubation for bronch but given pt adamantly DNI given possible need
   for trach, no bronch; also bronch would be difficult given
   desaturations
   - continue vanco, pip-tazo, levoflox for now
   - steroids (Solumedrol 60mg IV QD)
 will need po equivalent if going
   home
   - some coughing over last 24H, try to obtain sputum sample
   - Follow-up ACE-I, IGE, anti-GBM
   # ARF: Worsening since admission, unclear etiology.  UA negative for
   infection.  FeNa [**2-21**] = 1.2.  Likely some component of prerenal despite
   this given poor po intake.
   - Maintenance fluid while NPO
   - Send urine eos given new antibiotics
   - Trend, renally dose meds
   # LE edema: Pt with notable LE edema which by report is new. Bilateral,
   with some erythema which could represent venous stasis vs cellulitis.
   Echo showed preserved biventricular systolic function. LENIS showed DVT
   in left femoral vein.
   - vanco will cover cellulitis
   - continue heparin gtt for now, will not go home on anti-coagulation
   - encourage improved nutition as likely reflects prealbumin = 2
   .
   # Sacral decubiti: Multiple sacral decubiti, with some ? osteo per
   wife. Was treated with levoflox as outpatient, scheduled for Plastics

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of transverse myelitis, admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and closer monitoring. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including ineffective coping, anxiety, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), chronic respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypoxemia, decubitus ulcer, chronic pain, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 141/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen delivery and has been intubated.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals sacral decubitus ulcers, muscle wasting, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows decreased tone and paralysis of both lower extremities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia persists despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. The underlying cause could be aspiration, especially given the patulous esophagus. There is a concern for underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) based on chest CT findings. Intubation for bronchoscopy is considered, but it is"

   .
   # Hypoxia: persistent despite antibiotics for presumed pneumonia,
   ?aspiration especially as patient has patulous esophagus. Concerning
   for underlying IPF given chest CT findings. Unable to bronch so far due
   to easy desaturation to 60s. No PE per chest CTA. Less likely is
   pulmonary edema. Leukocytosis improving on abx. Did consider elective
   intubation for bronch but given pt adamantly DNI given possible need
   for trach, no bronch; also bronch would be difficult given
   desaturations
   - continue vanco, pip-tazo, levoflox for now
   - steroids (Solumedrol 60mg IV QD)
   - some coughing over last 24H, try to obtain sputum sample
   - CXR this AM
   - Follow-up ACE-I, IGE, anti-GBM
   # ARF: Worsening since admission, unclear etiology.  UA negative for
   infection.  FeNa [**2-21**] = 1.2.  Likely some component of prerenal despite
   this given poor po intake.
   - Maintenance fluid while NPO
   - Send urine eos given new antibiotics
   - Trend, renally dose meds
   # LE edema: Pt with notable LE edema which by report is new. Bilateral,
   with some erythema which could represent venous stasis vs cellulitis.
   Echo showed preserved biventricular systolic function. LENIS showed DVT
   in left femoral vein.
   - vanco will cover cellulitis
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - encourage improved nutition as likely reflects prealbumin = 2
   .
   # Sacral decubiti: Multiple sacral decubiti, with some ? osteo per
   wife. Was treated with levoflox as outpatient, scheduled for Plastics
   eval [**2164-2-16**] as outpatient..
   - f/u wound care recs
   - f/u plastics consult
   - holding vitamins / zinc currently as patient refusing all oral
   medications
   .
   # Tib/fib fx: Fx sustained falling from WC. This was not treated
   surgically.  Ortho aware.
   - Continue boot
   .
   # Chronic pain: Pt is on several medications, including methadone and
   fentanyl.
   - Continue meds cautiously given resp status
   - palliative care consult:
   - [**Female First Name (un) 1290**]-psych c/s: start remeron
   - prn fentanyl
   - continue IV ativan, IV haldol, IV fentanyl
   - psyche consult
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn /  bowel regimen/  minimal PO, consider
   continued peripheral nutrition
   .
   # PPX: PPI, heparin gtt, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: DNR/DNI

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of paraplegia due to transverse myelitis. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and closer monitoring/nursing care. The patient has multiple medical complications, including ineffective coping, anxiety, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, chronic pneumonia, hypoxemia, decubitus ulcer (present at admission), chronic pain, and possible interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) given the chest CT findings.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, steroids, and various pain medications such as methadone and fentanyl. The patient has a do not intubate (DNI) and do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 141/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient's physical examination shows signs of poor dentition, muscle wasting, and unable to stand. The patient has a Foley catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on"
