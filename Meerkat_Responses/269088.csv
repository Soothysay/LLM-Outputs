","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), dementia, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU from a nursing home with symptoms of shortness of breath, wheezing, and hypoxia. The patient has copious respiratory secretions and is aphasic with residual right-sided hemiparesis. She is currently on vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage, oxygen therapy, and fluoxetine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is likely due to pneumonia, possibly either nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NH/CAP) or aspiration pneumonia. There is also a flare-up of COPD exacerbation.
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Flare-up: The patient's wheezing on examination and LLL opacity on chest X-ray suggest a COPD flare-up.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Exacerbation: Although there is minimal evidence of CHF exacerbation on imaging, exam, and labs, the patient has a history of CHF.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, recurrent pneumonia, and aspiration. She was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. The patient is non-communicative, aphasic with residual right-sided hemiparesis, and incoherent. She has diffuse rhonchi and wheezing bilaterally, warm, dry extremities with mild lower extremity edema bilaterally.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.8 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 130 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/61 to 159/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her temperature is slightly below normal.

1. Pneumonia: The patient's condition remains unimproved with persistent leukocytosis and copious purulent secretions. Antibiotics have been continued, and azithromycin has been started for atypical coverage. Frequent suctioning, chest physiotherapy, and repeat sputum cultures are planned. Bronchoscopy may be considered if severe plugging or lack of improvement is observed.
2. COPD: Prednis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of aspiration pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), admitted from a nursing home with symptoms of shortness of breath, wheezing, and hypoxia. The patient has minimal evidence of congestive heart failure exacerbation on imaging, exam, and labs, but does have a history of congestive heart failure. She is experiencing respiratory distress, likely due to either nosocomial pneumonia (PNA) or aspiration pneumonia, possibly triggered by a COPD flare. The patient also has hypothyroidism, hypertension, dementia, depression, osteoporosis, and a feeding tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory symptoms and LLL opacity on OSH film indicate respiratory distress, likely due to PNA or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support, such as aerosol-cool and nebulized treatments, are necessary.

2. COPD Flare: The patient's history of COPD and the wheezing observed on examination suggest a COPD flare. Management should include continued steroids, standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs overnight, and consideration of changing to PRN in the morning pending improvement.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Although there is minimal evidence of CHF exacerbation, the patient has a history of CHF. Close monitoring for signs of volume overload, obtaining an E"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of aspiration pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted from a nursing home with shortness of breath, wheezing, and hypoxia. There is a possible left lower lobe opacity on the oxygen saturation history film.

The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress. She has wheezing on examination and a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. Her white blood cell count is elevated (22-28), suggesting a possible pneumonia (either nursing home-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia). The respiratory status is likely to be related to either condition. There is minimal evidence of congestive heart failure exacerbation on imaging, examination, and labs, but the patient has a history of congestive heart failure. She also has copious respiratory secretions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 84 bpm (with a range of 57-132 bpm), a blood pressure of 110/61 mmHg (with a range of 83-159/34-111 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (with a range of 16-37 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 92%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

   -Will continue with current prednisone dosing as she is requiring nebs
   PRN (atrovent) and will need to get a better and more durable response
   to bronchodilators.
   -This may require intermittent IPPV to aid with lung recruitment.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER-
   -Will move to vanco/CTZ/Flagyl/Azithro for ongoing Rx of Pneumonia
   -She raises clear concern for persistent aspiration events leading to
   inability to clear her pulmonary secretions and pneumonia.
   -Add urine legnionella to testing.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a chief complaint of pneumonia. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient was admitted with aspiration pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. She is currently in the ICU receiving close treatment with some improvement in her level of respiratory distress. However, she still has significant pulmonary secretions requiring frequent suctioning and continues to wheeze throughout her exam.

The patient has allergies to ciprofloxacin, and she is currently on multiple antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, metronidazole, and ceftazidime. She is also receiving lansoprazole (Prevacid) for stress ulcers and heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/52 mmHg to 159/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.23, PaCO2 61 mmHg, and PaO2 68 mmHg. Her physical examination reveals dullness to percussion,"

 CONCLUSION:
   The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are not well seen.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen. Valvular function could not be evaluated.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of COPD, recurrent pneumonia, and COPD exacerbation. She presented with hypoxia and dyspnea. The patient has been experiencing difficulty breathing, with diffuse rhonchi and moderate secretions. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/64 to 158/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has been receiving various medications and treatments, including diuretics, antibiotics, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of recurrent pneumonia and current symptoms suggest a possible pneumonia exacerbation. This can be indicated by the presence of leukocytosis, purulent secretions, and infiltrates on chest X-ray.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and symptoms such as dyspnea, bronchospasm, and increased sputum production may indicate a COPD exacerbation.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of hypoxia, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential complications like hypoxic brain injury.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient's echocardiogram shows a dilated left atrium and normal left ventricular systolic function. However, there is a possibility of a focal wall motion abnormality, and the a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recurrent pneumonia, and dementia. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and dyspnea.

The patient's medical history includes COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), dementia, and osteoporosis. She is also on medications for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient has received various treatments including diuretics, antibiotics, and respiratory support. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels are within normal range.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.8, slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, and elevated potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L. Imaging studies reveal a dilated left atrium and normal left ventricular systolic function, but further evaluation of the right ventricle and valvular function could not be done due to suboptimal technical quality.

The patient's current problems include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, pneumonia, stroke, and dementia. The assessment and plan include treatment for pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and other conditions such as congestive heart failure and hypertension."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recurrent pneumonia, and aspiration. She is currently admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and dyspnea, indicating an acute exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia. The patient has had multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VTACH), but no intervention was taken as her electrolytes were within normal limits.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, administration of lasix, and the initiation of antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 94-111 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129/74 to 144/105 mmHg, respiratory rate between 22-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. Her physical examination reveals wheezing and diffuse rhonchi in the lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no edema or cyanosis.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Kidney function is within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels are elevated, but other electrolytes and liver function tests are within normal range.

Imaging shows no significant changes in the chest X-ray, and microbiology results are pending. The"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female admitted with respiratory failure in the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. She is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been given Atrovent/Albuterol nebs and Prednisone at 30mg, which will be continued tomorrow. Prolonged rehab is likely needed for her to return to independent status.

The patient also has pneumonia, for which she is being treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and Flagyl. She has experienced some improvement in terms of secretion volume but still has significant limitations in mobilizing secretions.

Additionally, the patient has ventricular tachycardia, which is non-sustained, mono-morphic, and not triggered. Telemetry will be maintained, and an ECG will be checked.

The patient also has a history of CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction) with residual aphasia and dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct). She is a nursing home resident.

In the ICU, the patient's nutrition consists of Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 65 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has a PICC line in place for medication administration. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)"
