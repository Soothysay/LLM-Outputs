   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old quadriplegic male who presented to the ICU with a seizure and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of motor vehicle accident (MVA) 10 years ago, and the current symptoms may be related to that. The patient was intubated due to refractory seizures and has been given antibiotics for suspected meningitis. The patient also has bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicating potential pneumonia. The patient requires pressors for hypotension and has a right femoral line placed. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 99/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, platelet count of 210 K/uL, blood glucose level of 129 mg/dL, sodium level of 0.6 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride level of 7 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 35.2%, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.19. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is unresponsive and intubated. His cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and his respiratory examination shows rhonchorous breath sounds. The patient has no lower extremity edema and his skin examination is not assessed. Neurologically, the patient does not follow commands, responds to noxious stimuli, and has not been assessed for movement or tone.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is suspected to have seizure, fevers, respiratory failure, and potential sources of fevers include pneumonia and meningitis. The patient is being loaded with kepra and will have a lumbar puncture (LP) performed. Broad antibiotics will be continued.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, and septic shock is also a possibility. Broad coverage for pneumonia will be continued, and an LP will be performed. The patient will continue to receive intravenous fluids (IVF) and weaning of levophed will be done as possible. Weaning of mechanical ventilation will be done"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 33-year-old male who is quadriplegic due to a motor vehicle accident that occurred 10 years ago. He presented to the emergency room with a seizure and fever at home. Upon evaluation, he was found to have a temperature of 105.2 degrees Fahrenheit and was intubated because of refractory seizures. A head CT and shunt study were performed, which came back unremarkable. The patient was seen by a neurologist and neurosurgeon, who are both concerned about meningitis. A chest X-ray also revealed bilateral infiltrates, indicating possible pneumonia. He was given antibiotics and pressors for hypotension. 

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and has received several medications including propofol, norepinephrine, midazolam, and fentanyl. He also has a VP shunt for MSSA bacteremia, seizures, and an RIJ thrombus. 

Vital signs as of the last assessment show a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 99/78 to 106/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, central venous pressure is 16 mmHg, and fluid balance is within normal limits. 

The patient is currently intubated"

   Assessment and Plan
   Seizure, fevers - on propofol, being loaded with kepra. Suspect fevers
   are cause of seizures as they have been in the past. Potential sources
   of fevers include pneumonia and meningitis. Will perform LP. Cpntinue
   broad antibiotics.
   Resp failure, likely pneumonia, septic shock -  continue broad coverage
   for pneumonia. Will perform LP. Continue IVF and wean levophed as
   possible. Wean vent as tolerated.
   quadreplegia -
   mildly elevated transaminases - will repeat, if continue to be abnormal
   will perform U/S
   R IJ thrombus - was suppose to be on lovenox for 3 months, unclear if
   this happened, will reimage

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male who has been quadriplegic since a motor vehicle accident 10 years ago. He presented with a seizure and respiratory failure at home. In the emergency room, he had a high temperature of 105.2 degrees Fahrenheit and was intubated due to refractory seizures. A head CT and shunt study were performed, revealing no abnormalities. The patient was seen by a neurologist and neurosurgeon who are concerned about meningitis. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates, indicating potential pneumonia. He received antibiotics and pressors for hypotension. 

The patient's 24-hour events include the placement of a multi-lumen line, an EKG, and the administration of medications such as propofol, norepinephrine, midazolam, and fentanyl. His allergies include sulfonamides, and he experienced a rash from antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius (96.7 degrees Fahrenheit), blood pressure ranging from 99/78 to 106/78 mmHg, heart rate between 83 and 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His CVP is 16 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 101 mL and output of 1,420 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,319 mL"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, seizure disorder, bacteremia with a VP shunt in place on long-term antibiotics, and aspiration in the past. He was admitted in status epilepticus with a high fever and possible pneumonia on chest X-ray. There is concern that he has meningoencephalitis. His seizures could also be due to a systemic infection not specifically involving the CNS.

The patient required lorazepam and propofol to control the status epilepticus. He was intubated for airway protection in the emergency department. The etiology of the seizures is unclear, but likely due to medication non-compliance and infection.

The patient's current medical conditions include ineffective coping, seizure with status epilepticus, urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Status Epilepticus: 
   - Follow-up with neurology and neurosurgery consultants
   - Continue Levetiracetam 1500 mg IV Q12H
   - Baseline Keppra level not possible because was drawn in the wrong tube in the ED
   - Continue propofol and mechanical ventilation until no longer seizing and able to protect airway
   - Ativan PRN for seizure activity
   - Follow-up EEG
   - Tox screen negative
   - CT final read and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old man with quadriplegia who was admitted with seizures, respiratory failure, and pneumonia. He has been experiencing ineffective coping, seizure activity, urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining proper hygiene and suctioning of the endotracheal tube, regular chest physiotherapy, and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and quadriplegia increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism. Regular assessments for signs of DVT, such as leg edema and warmth, along with prophylactic measures like compression stockings or subcutaneous heparin injections, should be considered.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including UTIs, bloodstream infections, and wound infections. Strict adherence to hand hygiene, appropriate use of antibiotics, and proper infection control practices can help minimize these risks.
4. Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of seizures"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, seizure disorder, VP shunt, and previous aspiration. He was admitted in status epilepticus with high fever and possible pneumonia on chest X-ray. The concern is that he may have meningoencephalitis. 

The patient's current condition includes ineffective coping, seizure with status epilepticus, urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 97/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range. 

The patient is currently on several medications, including levetiracetam, lorazepam, ativan, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, metronidazole, azithromycin, and heparin. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, no skin abnormalities, and no neurologic deficits. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of seizures, development of organ dysfunction due to sepsis, progression of pneumonia, and potential infections related to the VP shunt."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, seizure disorder, bacteremia with a VP shunt, aspiration in the past, and long-term antibiotics. He was admitted in status epilepticus with high fever and possible pneumonia on chest X-ray. There is concern for meningoencephalitis. 

The patient's current condition includes ineffective coping, seizure with status epilepticus, urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. 

The patient required lorazepam and propofol to control seizures and was intubated for airway protection in the emergency department. The etiology of status epilepticus is unclear, but it is likely due to medication non-compliance and infection. A head CT and shunt study did not show significant changes to explain the status epilepticus. 

Consultations were requested from neurology and neurosurgery, and the patient is being continued on levetiracetam 1500 mg IV Q12H, ativan PRN for seizure activity, and home baclofen at 10mg.

The patient also has concerns for sepsis, which may be due to meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, or influenza infection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is clear, and he is no longer on dexamethasone for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, seizure disorder, previous VP shunt placement, and aspiration who was admitted in status epilepticus with a high fever and possible pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's seizures could also be due to systemic infection not specifically involving the CNS.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Status epilepticus: The patient required lorazepam and propofol to control the seizures. He was intubated for airway protection in the ED. The etiology of the status epilepticus is unclear, but likely due to medication non-compliance and infection. A head CT and shunt study did not show any significant changes to explain the status epilepticus. Neurology and neurosurgery consultants were contacted, and the patient is being continued on levetiracetam at a dose recommended by neurology. A baseline Keppra level could not be obtained because it was drawn in the wrong tube in the ED. The patient is also on Ativan for seizure activity, and an EEG read and neuro rec were requested.
