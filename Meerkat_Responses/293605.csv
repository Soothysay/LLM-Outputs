","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU. He developed pericarditis one week ago and subsequently developed a moderate-sized effusion without tamponade. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.5Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 110/63 to 95/55 mmHg, heart rate between 77 and 94 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient has crackles in the left bases on chest examination, trace edema in both lower extremities, and soft non-tender abdomen. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low potassium, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging and microbiology tests are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pericardial Effusion (without tamponade): The patient has a moderate-sized effusion without signs of tamponade. He will be monitored closely, and a follow-up echocardiogram will be done. If there is any compromise in blood pressure, aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation will be performed, and two peripheral IVs will be maintained. A repeat echo and pericardiocentesis are planned for Monday.

 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (WITHOUT TAMPONADE)
   59 yo M w/ CAD developed pericarditis one week ago, then developed
   moderate sized effusion w/o tamponade over the course of one week.
   Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # PUMP/EFFUSION: Fairly rapid accumulation of moderate sized effusion
   over the span of one week. Preliminary ECHO without tamponade
   physiology. Pulsus on arrival [**7-10**]. pt reports that his resting HR is
   in the 50s, although BP is stable, somewhat concerning that avg initial
   HR here was in 90s. BP at baseline.
   - trial of IVF to see if effect on HR
   - f/u final ECHO read tomorrow
   - if any compromise in BP would resuscitate with aggressive IVF;
   maintain two peripheral IVs
   - repeat ECHO on Monday: if any negative change in hemodynamics or
   interval increase in effusion, would pursue periocardiocentesis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD s/p distant PCI for stable angina. Reports good
   exercise tolernace w/o exertional angina/SOB and is followed by his
   outpt cards.
   - cont ASA 81mg, home statin, home niacin; pt is not on BB at home and
   see no indication to starting at this time
   .
   # Pericarditis: Based on symptoms, EKG findings, elevated ESR/CRP at
   the time of initial presentation one week ago. Did improve on
   NSAIDS--holding currently given that CP has resolved and Cr/ALT
   slightly elevated.
   .
   # Possible adrenal Insufficiency: Curbsided endocrine on arrival and
   started 20mg hydrocortisone qam, 10mg qpm.  He needs to establish care
   with an endocrinologist at the time of d/c.
   - Need to d/w Endo what discharge steroid, if any, would be.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with pericarditis and subsequently developed a moderate-sized effusion without tamponade. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 101.5Â°F, heart rate in the 70s, blood pressure ranging from 110/63 to 95/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient has been started on IV fluids, and a repeat transthoracic echo is planned for tomorrow. If there is any compromise in blood pressure or an increase in effusion size, the patient may undergo pericardiocentesis. The patient's coronary arteries have been treated with PCI for stable angina, and he is currently taking ASA, a statin, and niacin. The patient's pericarditis has improved on NSAIDs, but his creatinine and alanine aminotransferase levels are slightly elevated. He is also being investigated for possible adrenal insufficiency, for which he is receiving hydrocortisone treatment. The patient's pain has been controlled, and he is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU."

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, based on the information provided, the patient is being treated in the ICU for multiple medical complications.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable angina. They are currently on aspirin, statin, and niacin as part of their home cardiac regimen.

The patient also has pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, pleural effusion, anemia, and suspected adrenal insufficiency. The pericardial effusion has improved since the last echocardiogram, but there is still a small circumferential effusion present. The pleural effusion is likely from the same etiology as the pericardial effusion and could be extending from it. The patient's anemia may be secondary to anemia of inflammation or viral etiology. The cause of the adrenal insufficiency is not mentioned.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate in the 30s with occasional pauses during sleep, but they remain asymptomatic with adequate blood pressure. The temperature is slightly elevated at 38Â°C (100.4Â°F), and the respiratory rate is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The platelet count is within normal range. Renal function tests reveal mild abnormalities"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pericarditis. The patient's condition has been improving, with a decrease in pericardial effusion on transthoracic echo (TTE). However, the patient still has a pleural effusion, as seen on TTE and chest X-ray (CXR). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 40s and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, mild bibasilar crackles, and decreased breath sounds in the upper lung fields. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and the urine culture is also negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: Although the patient's current TTE does not show signs of tamponade, there is a small pericardial effusion present. If the effusion worsens or if the patient develops symptoms of tamponade (e.g., hypotension, muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distension), prompt pericardiocentesis may be necessary.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, which may require thoracentesis to drain the fluid and relieve symptoms. If the effusion persists or worsens, it could"

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previously underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable angina. They were exercising well without exertional angina or shortness of breath and were following an outpatient cardiology regimen including aspirin, statin, and niacin.

The patient also has a diagnosis of pericarditis, which was characterized by symptoms, EKG findings, elevated ESR/CRP at presentation, and responded to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with improved kidney function. Additionally, the patient is being treated for adrenal insufficiency with recommended hydrocortisone dosing of 20mg q AM and 10mg q PM. They will need to follow up with endocrinology as an outpatient.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38C (100.4F), heart rate of 45-82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/53 to 121/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

On physical examination, the patient has jugular venous distention (JVD) of 8 cm, distant heart sounds with normal S1 and S2, difficulty assessing murmurs, and a pulsus paradox of 4-"
