","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and previous necrotizing pneumonia. He also has a history of ""indolent MAC"" and presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

The patient's current presentation is consistent with aspiration pneumonia, but other possible etiologies include Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection (given positive β-glucan, although not sure if cefazolin is confounding), pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and increased Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). Other causes of hypoxia include Pulmonary Embolism (PE), which is less likely as he is not tachycardic, has no pleuritic pain, and no Lower Extremity (LE) swelling. He has not had any blood transfusions so not Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI).

His arterial blood gas (ABG) suggests a primary respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia despite having a Respiratory Rate (RR) in the 40's. His Alveolar-arterial (Aa) gradient is elevated.

Other causes of hypoxia such as pulmonary embolism (PE) are less likely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia suggest a primary respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia. The elevated alveolar-arterial (Aa) gradient indicates a ventilation-perfusion mismatch or diffusion impairment.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including coughing with intermittent yellow/green sputum production, suggest an aspiration event leading to pneumonia.
3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): Given the patient's prolonged hospital stay and the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, there is a risk for HAP.
4. Fungal infection: The positive beta-glucan indicates a fungal infection, although the use of cefazolin may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, necrotizing pneumonia, and a history of ""indolent MAC"" who now presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

The patient's current presentation is consistent with aspiration pneumonia; however, other possible etiologies include hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection (given positive beta-glucan, although not sure if cefazolin is confounding), pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and increased total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Other causes of hypoxia include pulmonary embolism (PE), which is less likely as the patient is not tachycardic, has no pleuritic pain, and no lower extremity swelling. He has not had any blood transfusions so not transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). His arterial blood gas (ABG) suggests a primary respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia despite having a respiratory rate in the 40's. His alveolar-arterial (Aa) gradient is elevated.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2175-4-12**] at 01:51 AM. He is currently receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 114/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 181 mL input and 296 mL output, with a total output of 2,000 mL. He is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and has an ABG pending. Physical examination findings are not available. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated creatinine and glucose levels. The patient has impaired skin integrity and acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The plan includes nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, and short gut syndrome. He also has severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient is severely malnourished and presents with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and worsening hypoxia. He has been on surgical service since the 4th and started total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since the 6th. The patient has been experiencing a worsening cough productive of greenish sputum, and his chest x-ray has shown worsening findings. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including cefazolin, clindamycin, and meropenem. Despite these interventions, his condition has continued to deteriorate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's current presentation suggests aspiration pneumonia; however, other possible etiologies include hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), tuberculosis (TB), or non-infectious etiology such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP).
2. Malnutrition: The patient is severely malnourished and requires nutritional support.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient is anuric and requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD) sessions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, previous necrotizing pneumonia, and severe malnutrition. He presents with severe hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The patient has been on surgical service since the 4th and started total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the 6th. He was also given cephazolin for a lower extremity ulcer on the 6th. He has been experiencing a worsening cough productive of greenish sputum, with worsening chest X-ray on the 3rd. He has been receiving intravenous antibiotics, including clindamycin started on the 5th, changed to meropenem on the 25th. Despite this, his pulmonary condition continues to decline, and his beta-glucan level is elevated (>500). 

The patient has had several desaturation events, including one episode of desaturation to 77%. He underwent ultrafiltration overnight. He has been on various medications, including albumin, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, ipratropium bromide/nebulizer, levothyroxine, mirtazapine, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 114/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 80% FiO2. His blood cultures were drawn on the 12th, and he received vancomycin overnight. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally, diminished breath sounds, and a bloody site at the central line insertion site. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.0 K/uL, hematocrit of 27.5%, platelet count of 97 K/uL, creatinine of 4.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 108 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.7 g/dL. Other lab results include elevated PT/PTT/INR, low calcium and magnesium levels, and elevated phosphorus levels. 

The patient has a history of osteomyelitis in the toe and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 24.0 g/dL. He also has thrombocytopenia with platelets below 100 K/uL. The patient's Crohn's disease has led to multiple bowel resections and short gut syndrome. He is currently hypothyroid and requires levothyroxine. 

The patient's code status is full code, and he requires discussion regarding end-of-life issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's presentation suggests aspiration pneumonia, but other possible etiologies include hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), non-infectious etiology bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The progressive pulmonary infiltrates over the last 4 months may indicate a progressive fungal infection.

2. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition, which can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.

3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis: The patient does not produce urine, indicating possible renal failure. He requires ongoing hemodialysis sessions and careful management of electrolytes.

4. Toe ulcer: The patient has a toe ulcer that may become infected, especially given his immunocompromised state.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is below normal, indicating thrombocytopenia. The etiology of this condition is unclear, and careful monitoring is necessary.

7. Crohn's disease complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and bowel resections can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and further gastrointestinal issues.

8. Hypothyroidism: The patient is hypothyroid and requires levothyroxine replacement.

9. Central line infection: The patient's central line insertion site appears slightly erythematous, indicating a possible line infection. Blood cultures through the PICC line and peripheral line should be sent.

10. End-of-life discussions: Given the patient's advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and current critical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, numerous bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and necrotizing pneumonia. He also has a history of ""indolent MAC"" infection. The patient presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe consolidations and hypoxia may be due to a multifactorial etiology including aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection (given positive B-glucan), pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and increased total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is also possible given his relative immunocompromised state.

2. Malnutrition: The patient has impaired skin integrity and severe malnutrition, which can lead to further complications such as pressure ulcers, infections, and impaired wound healing.

3. Impaired renal function: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. He does not make urine and will receive albumin prior to HD per renal recommendations. This indicates compromised renal function and potential electrolyte imbalances.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 24, indicating"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and previous necrotizing pneumonia. The patient also has a history of ""indolent MAC"" and presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

The patient's current assessment includes the following:

1. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition, likely due to his short gut syndrome and chronic disease.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has numerous bruises but no evident cellulitis or rash.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has severe consolidations and hypoxia, with a likely multifactorial etiology including aspiration pneumonia, possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and increased total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is also a possibility given the patient's relative immunocompromised state.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has trended down to 24, possibly due to anemia of chronic disease.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of low platelet count (<100), with an unclear etiology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. They have a history of allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine, and neutropenia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin. They are also on pantoprazole for gastric protection and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 117/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increase in fluid intake and output balance.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and low albumin levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is being treated for malnutrition, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. They have multiple IV lines, including a multi-lumen line, and receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   is [**1-16**] aspiration pneumonia; however, he also has several other
   possible etiologies including HAP, fungal infection, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], vrs
   non-infectious etiology BOOP reaction.   As review of imaging has
   demonstrated a slow but progressive pulmonary infiltrates over the last
   4 months.  This would fit with progressive [**Name10 (NameIs) **] infection.
   - continue Vanc and meropenam 500 IV Q HD for broad coverage of gm neg
   and anaerobes
   - currently, he is not being adequately covered for atypicals and
   fungals
   - Will send induced sputum for  AFB, fungal smear and cx, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   stain and cx
   -Will resend beta glucan and galactomannan

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and necrotizing pneumonia. The patient presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, which may be due to aspiration pneumonia or other possible etiologies such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), or non-infectious etiology bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Imaging has shown progressive pulmonary infiltrates over the last four months, which could indicate a progressive infection.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage. Additional tests, including induced sputum for acid-fast bacilli, fungal smear, and cultures for PCP and other pathogens, will be sent. Beta glucan and galactomannan tests will also be repeated.

The patient has malnutrition and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through a right internal jugular (RIJ) line. Plans include tube placement and nutritional recommendations. The patient is also on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and will receive 25 grams of albumin prior to HD. Medications will be dosed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's current presentation is consistent with aspiration pneumonia, but other possible etiologies include hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, non-infectious etiology bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), malignancy, and volume overload. The progressive pulmonary infiltrates over the last 4 months suggest a chronic condition.
2. Malnutrition: The patient has a history of severe malnutrition, which may contribute to delayed wound healing and increased susceptibility to infections.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient is undergoing hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and does not produce urine. This indicates significant renal impairment and the need for ongoing renal replacement therapy.
4. Toe ulcer: The patient has a toe ulcer that is erythematous but does not appear cellulitic. It is important to monitor this site for signs of infection or worsening.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has trended down from the 30s on admission to 24 currently. This could be due to chronic"

Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's presentation suggests aspiration pneumonia, but other possible etiologies such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), non-infectious etiology bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) reaction, malignancy, and volume overload should be considered. Imaging has shown progressive pulmonary infiltrates over the last 4 months. The patient is not being adequately covered for atypical pathogens like MAC and fungi. Sputum samples should be sent for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear, fungal smear and culture, and cytology. Beta glucan and galactomannan levels should also be followed up. The possibility of bronchoscopy with or without biopsy and repeating chest X-ray should be discussed. Empirical steroids may be considered if all cultures are negative.

   hx ""indolent MAC"" who now presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral
   pulmonary infltrates and worsening hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Currently unclear etiology for his
   severe consolidations and hypoxia. It is likely multifactorial etiology
   including aspiration pneumonia, +/-HAP, fungal infection (given
   positive B-glucan, abumin will confound the test), pulmonary edema from
   volume overload in setting of ESRD and increased TPN. MAC is also
   possible given his relative immunocompromised state.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. PE
   unlikely as he is not tachycardic, has no pleuritic pain, and no LE
   swelling. He has not had any blood transfusions so not TRALI. His ABG
   suggests a primary respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia despite having
   a RR in 40's. His Aa gradient is elevated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, previous necrotizing pneumonia, and a history of ""indolent MAC."" He presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. The patient has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and malnutrition. He is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a toe ulcer. The patient also has anemia of chronic disease, thrombocytopenia, Crohn's disease with bowel resections and short gut syndrome, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe consolidations and hypoxia could be due to a multifactorial etiology including aspiration pneumonia, possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection (given positive beta-glucan), pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of ESRD, and increased TPN. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is also possible given the patient's relative immunocompromised state. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is less likely as the patient is not tachycardic, has no pleuritic pain, and no leg swelling. Trans"

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  marginally improved. [**Month (only) 453**] O2 requirement

   consolidations and hypoxia. It is likely multifactorial etiology
   including aspiration pneumonia, +/-HAP, fungal infection (given
   positive B-glucan, abumin will confound the test), pulmonary edema from
   volume overload in setting of ESRD and increased TPN. MAC is also
   possible given his relative immunocompromised state.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. PE
   unlikely as he is not tachycardic, has no pleuritic pain, and no LE
   swelling. He has not had any blood transfusions so not TRALI. His ABG

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, numerous bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, necrotizing pneumonia, and ""indolent MAC."" He presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is likely multifactorial, including aspiration pneumonia, possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and tuberculosis (MAC). The patient is also immunocompromised due to his medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has marginally improved, but it is still a concern. There may be complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of chronic aspiration and severe pulmonary disease, he is at risk for recurrent aspiration events, which can lead to pneumonia.
3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's prolonged hospital stay and immunocompromised state make him susceptible to HAP.
4. Fungal infection: The positive B-glucan result suggests a possible fungal infection, which needs to be further evaluated and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, previous necrotizing pneumonia, and a history of indolent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. The patient presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure with a multifactorial etiology, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), malnutrition, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and anemia of chronic disease. Other issues include thrombocytopenia, Crohn's disease with bowel resections and short gut syndrome, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's chronic aspiration, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is at risk for HAP due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.
3. Fungal infection: The positive B-glucan suggests a possible fungal infection, which needs to be considered and treated appropriately.
4. Pulmonary edema: Given the patient's ESRD and volume overload, pulmonary edema could be a potential complication.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple bowel resections, and short gut syndrome, presenting with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. The patient's condition is complicated by impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute), malnutrition, impaired wound healing, and potential infections such as aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with unclear etiology. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia, HAP, pulmonary edema from volume overload, or a fungal infection. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is essential to ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for various infections due to his immunocompromised state. The presence of positive B-glucan suggests a possible fungal infection. Further evaluation with fungal culture and sensitivity testing is warranted. Additionally, the patient has been treated for tuberculosis, but it is unclear if he is still infectious. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

3. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition, which can delay wound healing and increase the risk of infections. Nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been initiated. Close monitoring of the patient's nutritional status and adjustment of TPN"

   For emphasis, I would also add:
   - Hypoxic acute/chronic respiratory failure: agree with continued
   dialysis with UF to remove fluid. The acute worsening is likely due to
   aspiration exacerbated by volume overload (pleural effusion tapped in
   [**Month (only) **] was transudate). Other etiologies include atypical pneumonia,
   fungal, MAC disease, HAP, PCP.

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Currently unclear etiology for his
   severe consolidations and hypoxia. It is likely multifactorial etiology
   including aspiration pneumonia, +/-HAP, fungal infection (given
   positive B-glucan, abumin will confound the test), pulmonary edema from

   possible given his relative immunocompromised state.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. PE
   unlikely as he is not tachycardic, has no pleuritic pain, and no LE
   swelling. He has not had any blood transfusions so not TRALI. His ABG

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and previous necrotizing pneumonia. He also has a history of indolent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. The patient presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

The patient's current condition is characterized by hypoxic respiratory failure with an unclear etiology. Possible causes include aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and increased total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient is immunocompromised, making Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection possible as well.

The patient has been diagnosed with malnutrition and impaired skin integrity. He requires strict nothing by mouth (NPO) due to the risk of aspiration. The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is low, indicating ESRD. He is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) three times a week and will receive albumin prior to HD per renal recommendations.

The patient has a toe ulcer that does not appear to be cellulitic but is erythematous. His hemoglobin levels have been trending down from the 30s to 24, indicating"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease, chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, previous necrotizing pneumonia, and ""indolent MAC."" The patient presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation through a high flow nasal cannula and has a tracheostomy. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe consolidations and hypoxia may be due to a multifactorial etiology including aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and increased total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
2. Malnutrition: The patient is severely malnourished, which can increase the risk of infections and delayed wound healing.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has toe ulcers that are erythematous but not cellulitic. There is a risk of progression to cellulitis or other complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. The cause is likely anemia of chronic disease, but further evaluation is needed.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, numerous bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and necrotizing pneumonia. He also has a history of ""indolent MAC"" and presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure with an unclear etiology for severe consolidations and hypoxia. The possible causes include aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and increased total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is also possible given his relative immunocompromised state. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is unlikely as he is not tachycardic, has no pleuritic pain, and no lower extremity swelling. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is also unlikely since he has not had any blood transfusions.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) suggests a primary respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia despite having a respiratory rate in the 40s. His alveolar-arterial gradient is elevated.

The patient has several other medical conditions, including malnutrition, impaired skin integrity, ESRD on hemodialysis"

   Disposition :ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and previous necrotizing pneumonia. The patient also has a history of indolent Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection.

The patient presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. The assessment indicates possible etiologies for the patient's current presentation, including aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, non-infectious etiology bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) reaction, malignancy, and volume overload.

The plan includes continuing Vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin. Repeat Beta-Glucan is elevated, and further discussion with the Infectious Disease (ID) team is needed regarding possible treatment of fungal/mold infection. Repeat sputum for cytology is also recommended due to atypical cells seen on the prior specimen.

Given the patient's decision for do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status, bronchoscopy with or without biopsy and repeat chest X-ray may not be safe to perform.

Other plans include continuing acapella valve QID, strict nothing by mouth (NPO), and continuing hemodialysis (HD) today. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unknown weight. They are currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute malnutrition, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a history of allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine, as well as neutropenia. They have received various antibiotics including vancomycin, azithromycin, meropenem, and micafungin. The patient is being treated with pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and TPN without lipids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently compromised, leading to acute respiratory failure. It is important to closely monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels and provide appropriate respiratory support.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of infections. Regular assessment and management of the patient's skin condition are necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Malnutrition: The patient is diagnosed with malnutrition, which can weaken the immune system and delay healing. Nutritional support through TPN or enteral feeding should be continued to meet the patient's nutritional needs.
4. Allergies: The patient has a documented allergy to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine. Care should be taken to avoid exposure to these allergens during medication administration.
5. Neutropenia: The patient's history of neutropenia indicates a decreased number of neutrophils"

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Currently unclear etiology for his
   severe consolidations and hypoxia. It is likely multifactorial etiology
   including aspiration pneumonia, +/-HAP, fungal infection (given
   positive B-glucan, abumin will confound the test), pulmonary edema from
   volume overload in setting of ESRD and increased TPN. MAC is also
   possible given his relative immunocompromised state.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. PE
   unlikely as he is not tachycardic, has no pleuritic pain, and no LE
   swelling. He has not had any blood transfusions so not TRALI. His ABG
   suggests a primary respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia despite having
   a RR in 40's. His Aa gradient is elevated. His [**4-12**] repeat Bglucan is
   also elevated at >500 with normal galactomannan.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and a previous case of necrotizing pneumonia. He also has a history of ""indolent MAC"" and presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with the following conditions: hypoxic respiratory failure, malnutrition, impaired skin integrity, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, and erythematous toe ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's severe consolidations and hypoxia could be due to a multifactorial etiology including aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection (positive B-glucan), pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of ESRD, increased total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection.
2. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition which may further complicate his overall health and recovery.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, specifically an erythematous toe ulcer, which could lead to potential complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple bowel resections, severe pulmonary disease, chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. He presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely caused by aspiration pneumonia, potentially hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, pulmonary edema from volume overload in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and increased total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Other possible causes include Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient has impaired skin integrity, malnutrition, respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and anemia of chronic disease. He also has a toe ulcer, thrombocytopenia, and Crohn's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of chronic aspiration and severe pulmonary disease increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's prolonged hospital stay and immunocompromised state increase the risk of HAP.
3. Fungal infection: The positive beta-glucan test suggests a fungal infection, and the patient's immunocompromised state further increases the risk.
4. Pulmonary edema: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, and previous necrotizing pneumonia. The patient presents with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has several possible etiologies for his current presentation, including aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), fungal infection, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), non-infectious etiology bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) reaction, malignancy, and volume overload. These complications need to be closely monitored and treated accordingly.

2. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition, which can lead to further complications such as impaired immune function, delayed wound healing, and increased risk of infections. Nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is recommended.

3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD): The patient currently does not make urine and requires renal replacement therapy in the form of HD. Medications need to be adjusted based on renal function.

4. Toe ulcer: The patient has a toe ulcer that is erythematous but does not appear to be cellulitic at this time. It should be monitored for signs of infection or worsening.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has been trending down from the 30s to 24, indicating anemia. Macrocytosis is present, and further investigation into the cause of anemia is needed. Blood transfusion may be necessary if Hct falls below 21.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has had persistently low platelet counts (<100) for the past year, with unclear etiology. Monitoring of platelet counts is important to identify any significant drops or bleeding risks.

7. Crohn's disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease with bowel resections and short gut syndrome. Management includes electrolyte repletion and head of bed elevation for severe reflux.

8. Hypothyroidism: The patient requires continued treatment for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition require close monitoring and management of various potential complications."
