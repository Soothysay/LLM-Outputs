","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, including alcohol, heroin, cocaine, and GBL (GBL pro-drug). He presented to the emergency department with suspected symptoms of withdrawal, such as tachycardia, tremors, and twitching. He has been admitted multiple times for withdrawal treatment and has used phenobarbital in the past. The patient admitted to heavy alcohol use, with his last use on Monday. He has multiple ""gelatinous"" brain tumors and is at risk for hydrocephalus. The patient's primary psychiatrist is considering administrative action against him, which may require attendance at a detox program. The psychiatrist also questions if the patient might be bipolar. 

Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of withdrawal, including tachycardia, tremors, and twitching. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has required previous admissions for withdrawal treatment.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be secondary to alcohol withdrawal. It is important to monitor for other causes such as intracranial processes, infection, or seizure activity.
3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient may have anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely related to alcohol consumption. Other possibilities include ingestion of other substances. Further testing, including ABG with lactate and serum osmols to calculate the osmol gap,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, including alcohol, heroin, cocaine, and GBL (GBL pro-drug). He presented to the emergency department with suspected symptoms of withdrawal, such as tachycardia, tremors, and twitching. The patient has been admitted multiple times for withdrawal treatment and has admitted to heavy alcohol use, last on Monday. He was treated with phenobarbital 30mg q8hr and valium CIWA scale in the past.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures)
2. Altered mental status-like secondary to the above. Will monitor for other signs such as intracranial process, infection, seizure activity.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis-Likely related to ETOH. Other possibilities include other ingested substances.
4. Sinus tachycardia-likely secondary to withdrawal from above substance. Will continue to monitor for signs of other causes such as fever, pain, hypovolemia, infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink. It is characterized by sudden and severe mental or neurological changes, including hallucinations, agitation, and confusion.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can also cause seizures, which can range"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of GBL addiction presenting with GBL withdrawal symptoms. He has been receiving phenobarbital, Valium, and haloperidol for symptom control. The patient also has urinary retention, for which a Foley catheter has been placed. There are concerns about possible psychosis or primary psychiatric disorder, and the patient will require psychiatric admission once stabilized. Brain MRI abnormalities are present and need further evaluation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with no fever, chest pain, or respiratory distress. His laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. However, the blood glucose level is on the lower end of normal. The patient is well-nourished and shows no signs of distress or pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GBL withdrawal symptoms: The patient may continue to experience withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, delirium, and insomnia.
2. Urinary retention: The patient's urinary retention could be due to drug effect or another underlying cause. It is important to monitor his urine output and assess for any complications related to urinary retention.
3. Possible psychosis or primary psychiatric disorder: Given the patient's history of GBL addiction and current presentation, there is a possibility of psychosis or a primary psychiatric disorder. Close monitoring and appropriate psychiatric evaluation are necessary.
4. Brain MRI abnormalities: The presence of abnormalities on the brain MRI requires further evaluation to clarify the nature"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, including alcohol, heroin, cocaine, and GBL (GBL pro-drug). He presented to the emergency department with suspected symptoms of withdrawal, such as tachycardia, tremors, and twitching. He has been admitted multiple times for substance withdrawal and has admitted to heavy alcohol use, with his last drink on Monday. In the past, he has been treated with phenobarbital and diazepam for withdrawal symptoms. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), blood pressure of 104/67 mmHg, heart rate of 68 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Physical examination shows that the patient is somnolent, with intermittent twitching, and he is arousable and able to follow commands. Neurological examination reveals vertical and horizontal nystagmus, with motor strength rated at 3-27. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal glucose level, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function test results. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Imaging studies, including a CT scan of the head, are pending. The patient is currently receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal with haloperidol and diazepam, and he is also being monitored for altered mental status, urinary retention, and possible anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely secondary to substance withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by sudden and severe mental or neurological changes, including confusion, hallucinations, fever, rapid heartbeat, and seizures. The patient's altered mental status, tremors, and twitching may indicate the onset of DTs.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures, which can range from minor to life-threatening. The patient's neurological examination shows motor weakness and nystagmus, which could be indicative of seizure activity.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to substance abuse increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and elevated white blood cell count, is essential.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: This condition can occur due to excessive alcohol consumption, leading to a buildup of acidic substances in the blood. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated anion gap, which may suggest this condition.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating a potential risk for hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary to prevent hypotensive episodes.
6. Urinary retention: The patient is currently managed with a Foley catheter, but the etiology of urinary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, including alcohol, heroin, cocaine, and GBL (GBL pro-drug). He presents to the emergency department with suspected symptoms of withdrawal, such as tachycardia, tremors, and twitching. The patient admits to heavy alcohol use, with his last drink being on Monday. In the past, he has been admitted for withdrawal treatment with phenobarbital and diazepam. The patient is currently experiencing altered mental status, which may be secondary to withdrawal or other factors such as intracranial processes, infection, or seizure activity. He also has urinary retention, possibly due to medication effect, and anion gap metabolic acidosis likely related to alcohol consumption. The patient is being monitored closely for signs of other causes of sinus tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur in individuals with a history of heavy drinking. Symptoms include severe agitation, hallucinations, fever, and rapid heartbeat. It is important to closely monitor the patient for these symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can also cause seizures, which can range from minor to life-threatening. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of seizure activity and appropriate interventions should be taken if necessary.
3. Infection: Due to the patient's altered mental state and possible impaired"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, including alcohol, heroin, cocaine, and GBL (GBL pro-drug). He presented to the emergency department with suspected symptoms of withdrawal, such as tachycardia, tremors, and twitching.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Alcohol Withdrawal (including Delirium Tremens, DTS, Seizures): The patient has a history of heavy alcohol use and recent admissions for withdrawal. He is being treated with phenobarb 15mg TID and valium CIWA scale for now. Haldol PRN agitation is also being administered.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered secondary to the above conditions. The healthcare team will monitor for other signs such as intracranial processes, infection, or seizure activity. A head CT may be considered if mental status does not clear, and an infectious workup will be conducted.

3. Colloid Brain Cysts: The patient has suspected colloid cysts, and records and reports from [**Hospital1 586**] are to be obtained. Neurosurgical consultation is being considered.

4. Urinary Retention: The patient has urinary retention of unclear etiology, which could be medication-related. Foley catheterization has been performed, and a urinalysis (U/A) and chest X-ray ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of GBL addiction, currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. He has been agitated and delirious in the evening, treated with haloperidol (Haldol) and diazepam (Valium). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-151/67-111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on various medications including haloperidol, diazepam, famotidine, nicotine, multivitamins, thiamine, and valium. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and the respiratory system is clear. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. Neurological assessment is not complete due to unresponsiveness and lack of movement. 

Laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, glucose, and albumin. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus are within normal limits. Imaging studies show no new findings.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concern is GBL addiction with ongoing withdrawal symptoms. He is currently doing well with the use of valium, haldol,"

","The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of substance abuse, including GBL (gamma butyrolactone) abuse. He presented to the emergency department with suspected symptoms of withdrawal, including tachycardia, tremors, and twitching. The patient has been admitted multiple times for GBL withdrawal in the past and has also reported heavy alcohol use, with his last drink being on Monday. 

During his current admission, the patient initially did well but became agitated around 6 pm, requiring multiple doses of both oral and intravenous haloperidol. He also had torticollis, which responded to Benadryl. The patient's heart rate remained in the 130s for more than two hours, and he continued to be very agitated overnight, threatening to leave against medical advice. He received a total of 40 mg of intravenous and oral haloperidol during the acute episode. Phenobarbital was restarted as needed (given once), and the patient calmed overnight after discussing restraints.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate ranging from 59 to 132 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 77/56 mmHg to 114/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of substance abuse and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) abuse admitted for GBL withdrawal. He has been using GBL daily for the past two weeks and attempted to detox from it using alcohol. The patient has been requiring high doses of Valium (80 mg yesterday) in addition to phenobarbital and haloperidol. Psychiatric and toxicology consultations have been obtained, and the patient is being closely monitored. He continues to have outbursts of agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GBL withdrawal symptoms: GBL withdrawal can cause severe agitation, hallucinations, tremors, seizures, and in some cases, delirium tremens.
2. Valium overdose: The patient has been given high doses of Valium (up to 80 mg), which can lead to sedation, dizziness, confusion, impaired coordination, and respiratory depression.
3. Phenobarbital overdose: The patient is also receiving phenobarbital, which can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, and respiratory depression.
4. Haloperidol overdose: Haloperidol can lead to sedation, low blood pressure, and QT prolongation on the ECG.
5. Urinary retention: The patient previously experienced urinary retention, which has since resolved.
6. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is intermittently elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 9-year-old male admitted to the ICU for GBL withdrawal. Over the course of the morning, the patient was doing well but became agitated in the evening, requiring multiple doses of haloperidol (PO and IV) for agitation and torticollis, which responded to Benadryl. The patient's heart rate remained in the 130s for over two hours and was very agitated overnight, threatening to leave against medical advice. The patient received a total of 40 mg IV and PO haloperidol during the acute episode and calmed down after discussing restraints. Phenobarbital was restarted PRN, and the patient calmed overnight.

Medical history obtained from the patient, including no known drug allergies. The patient is currently on several medications including famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), diazepam (Valium), and other ICU medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), current temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate ranging from 59 to 132 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 77/56 mmHg to 114/110 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 13 to 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. Heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a history of GBL addiction and withdrawal. He is currently in the ICU for ongoing benzodiazepine requirement for symptom control. The patient has experienced acute agitation, delirium, and combativeness, which were eventually controlled with increasing doses of valium and phenobarb. He also had torticollis, which resolved with Benadryl. There are no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications, including diazepam (valium), phenobarbital, and others. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/91 mmHg to 168/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is mostly negative except for the noted events. Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. However, the patient's prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and INR are elevated, while his CK, CKMB, and troponin-T levels are within normal limits. The patient's microbiology results indicate an infection with group B streptococcus.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly low magnesium level. His blood cultures are negative for any growth. The patient is improving slowly and the plan is to restart phenobarbital, continue valium as needed, and start dilantin per psychiatric consultation. The patient will be transferred to the floor later today if he remains stable."
