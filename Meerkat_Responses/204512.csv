The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and left main descending artery stent placement, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. He also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis (AS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post aortobifemoral bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) status post repair, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented to the hospital with recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 109/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. He is extubated and awake, following commands without acute distress. Physical examination reveals occasional bibasilar rales, a regular heart rhythm with a murmur at the right upper sternal border and apex, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows reduced strength in the left lower extremity due to an old injury, and a bilateral lower extremity exam is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2122**] and left main descending artery stenting (LMain DES) in [**1-/2131**]. He also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis (AS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post aortobifemoral bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) status post repair, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presents with recurrent pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), and there are concerns about scar-mediated VT potentiated by anesthesia induction. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent pulseless VT: The patient's history of CAD and previous episodes of VT increase the risk of recurrent VT. It is important to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and continue with the administration of IV amiodarone bolus and continuous infusion as per the plan.

2. Coronary artery disease/CAD: The patient has a history of significant CAD and previous CABG surgery. There may be concerns about ongoing ischemia or new blockages in the coronary arteries. Regular monitoring of the patient's cardiac status and consideration for further cardiac interventions may be necessary.

3. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, which can be exacerbated by various factors such as fluid overload, cardiac arrhythmias, or worsening of underlying heart conditions. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid balance, respiratory status, and cardiac function is important to prevent exacerbation of CHF.

4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, which can further compromise cardiac function and increase the risk of right ventricular strain or failure. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and cardiac function is essential.

5. Mild AS: The patient has mild aortic stenosis, which can contribute to increased cardiac workload and potential complications such as syncope or heart failure. Regular assessment of the patient's symptoms and consideration for further evaluation by a cardiologist may be necessary.

6. PVD and AAA: The patient's history of PVD and AAA may increase the risk of peripheral circulation problems, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Monitoring for signs of DVT and providing appropriate prophylaxis are important to prevent complications.

7. ESRD: The patient is on HD due to ESRD. Close monitoring of the patient's renal function and electrolyte balance is necessary to avoid complications related to renal failure.

8. Right hip fracture: The patient has a mechanical fall resulting in a right hip fracture. Management of pain, consideration for surgical intervention, and prevention of complications such as DVT are important in this case.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), left main desist (LMain DES), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% on most recent echocardiogram (echo), decompensated heart failure (dCHF), pulmonary hypertension (pulm htn), mild aortic stenosis (AS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) after aortobifemoral bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hip fracture from mechanical fall, and recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential medical complications:
1. Recurrent pulseless VT: The patient has a history of recurrent pulseless VT. Immediate intervention with IV amiodarone bolus and continuous infusion is recommended, along with further evaluation and management as per cardiac electrophysiology (EP) consult.
2. Coronaries/CAD: The patient underwent CABG for 3-vessel disease, and subsequent catheterization showed patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD), occluded saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery (SVG-RCA), and occluded SVG to om1/om33. App"

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, left mainstem desensus (LMain DES), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%, decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF), pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis (AS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with previous aortobifemoral bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hip fracture, and recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient underwent cardiac surgery and experienced a pulseless VT event intraoperatively, which was likely related to anesthesia induction and hemodialysis.

The patient's current vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 109/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is extubated and awake, following commands without acute distress.

The patient's physical examination reveals occasional bibasilar rales on chest auscultation, a regular rhythm with a murmur at the right upper sternal border (RUSB) and also appreciated at the apex, non-distended abdomen, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), left main descending artery stent placement, left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, decompensated heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and hip fracture.

The patient presented with recurrent pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was resuscitated. He underwent mechanical fall leading to a hip fracture and is awaiting surgery. The patient also has a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to a blocked left main artery.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Recurrent pulseless VT: Started IV amiodarone bolus and infusion, continuous electrocardiogram monitoring, consideration for electrophysiology consult, post-operative trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess possible focal wall motion abnormality, and discussion with anesthesia regarding scar-mediated VT potentiated by anesthesia induction.
2. Coronaries/CAD: Aspirin, beta-blocker, statin therapy, and holding on Plavix until surgery.
3. Pump: Most recent echo showing left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and mildly dilated right vent"

The patient presented with hip fracture after a mechanical fall and has a history of recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient underwent an orthopedic procedure for the hip fracture and was started on anticoagulation with warfarin to target INR 1.5-2.0 post-operatively.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2122**] and left main stem stent placement in [**1-/2131**]. He also has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% on most recent echocardiogram (TTE).
- The patient has a past medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) following aortobifemoral bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient presented to the hospital with recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and underwent mechanical fall with subsequent hip fracture, which was surgically repaired (ORIF).
- The patient's recent TTE shows an ejection fraction of 40-50% with inferior and posterior hypokinesis.
- The patient was recommended to continue on amiodarone for 24 more hours, then to be discontinued if the patient remains stable.
- The patient began experiencing bilateral arm weakness, and a neurologic evaluation revealed decreased strength in the left and right deltoid muscles."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - TTE yesterday shows EF 40-50% with inferior & posterior hypokinesis,
   new in comparison to prior [**2-3**] echo
   - went for ortho procedure (ORIF R hip), now weight-bearing per ortho.
   Recommended anticoagulation with warfarin to target INR 1.5 - 2.0
   post-operatively.
   - EP recs: patient to continue on amiodarone 0.5 mg/kg/min for 24 more
   hours, then d/c if patient remains stable
   - post-operatively patient began to c/o bilateral arm weakness, on
   initial neuro exam patient was found to have 1+/5 L deltoid strength,
   0/5 R deltoid strength.  Ortho was consulted and saw patient,
   recommended NSGY eval.  NSGY recommended placing patient in hard collar
   and CT c-spine.  Per Rads, CT c-spine showed significant cervical
   narrowing of spinal canal which could represent old stenosis but would
   be potentially worrisome for acute cord impingment.  During this time,
   patient's neuro exam gradually resolved with improved L arm strength,
   then R arm strength, ultimately with improvement to baseline.  After
   discussion with NSGY, plan was to get MRI c-spine nonemergently for
   further assessment.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, left mainstem desolate stent (DES), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% on most recent echocardiogram (echo), decompensated heart failure (dCHF), pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis (AS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post aortobifemoral bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hip fracture, and recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient underwent an orthopedic procedure for right hip fracture and is now weight-bearing per orthopedic recommendation. Anticoagulation with warfarin was recommended to target INR 1.5-2.0 post-operatively. The patient continues on amiodarone at 0.5 mg/kg/min for 24 more hours, then to be discontinued if stable. The patient initially presented with bilateral arm weakness, but the neurologic examination gradually resolved with improved left arm strength, then right arm strength, ultimately returning to baseline. An MRI of the cervical spine is planned for further assessment. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new development of bilateral arm weakness.

   preoperative recurrent pulseless monomorphic VT.  No strips of the
   events are available, and events are per discussion with anesthesia.
   Given known CAD, consider scar mediated VT, potentiated by anesthesia
   induction.  Hypotensive yesterday during HD before could be called out,
   responded to fluids.
   # Recurrent pulseless VT: occurred in OR, likely in the setting of HD
   and anethesia induction.  Recent echo shows area of hypokinesis
   consistent with scar which could potentially be focus.
   - per EP recs, stopped amiodarone gtt.  Assuming no further events,
   patient does not need further amiodarone treatment.
   - per EP recs, no study warranted at this time.  EP feels that even if
   an inducible VT was noted on study, they could not be sure  that this
   was the pathway responsible for the patient
s OR event, as the original
   strip from the OR is not available and could not compared to an
   inducible rhythm.
   # hypotension
 Corrected with fluids, likely due to excess volume
   removal (initially) during HD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and left main stem (LMain) drug-eluting stent placement. He also has a history of decompensated heart failure (dCHF), pulmonary hypertension (pulm htn), mild aortic stenosis (AS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) that required aortobifemoral bypass surgery, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). Additionally, the patient has a history of hip fracture repair and recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient experienced a hypotensive episode during HD, which responded to fluid administration. He was started on coumadin (warfarin) for anticoagulation, and amiodarone was stopped per electrophysiology (EP) recommendations. The EP also did not recommend further study at this time, as they could not be certain about the responsible pathway for the patient's OR event.

The patient's neurological weakness has improved, and a CT scan of the C-spine showed significant narrowing, potentially old changes. An MRI was ordered to reassess the condition. The patient continues to wear a cervical collar until cleared by neurosurgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), left main stem stent, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. He has multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient also has a history of recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and has undergone mechanical fall with hip fracture repair. 

During his stay in the ICU, the patient experienced hypotensive episodes during HD and anesthesia induction, which were managed with fluid resuscitation. He was started on warfarin for anticoagulation and aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. An electrophysiology (EP) study was recommended to assess for reproducible nidus of VT and potential target for ablation. The patient's neurological weakness improved, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical spine showed significant narrowing, potentially old changes. An MRI was ordered to reassess the condition, and the patient was advised to continue wearing a cervical collar until cleared by neurosurgery.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o male w/ CAD s/p CABG in [**2122**] and LMain DES [**1-/2131**], LVEF of 60%
   on most recent echo, dCHF, pulm htn, mild AS, PVD s/p aortobifem
   bypass, AAA s/p repair, ESRD on HD with hip fx s/p mechanical fall and
   preoperative recurrent pulseless monomorphic VT.  No strips of the
   events are available, and events are per discussion with anesthesia.
   Given known CAD, consider scar mediated VT, potentiated by anesthesia
   induction.  Hypotensive yesterday during HD before could be called out,
   responded to fluids.
   # Recurrent pulseless VT: occurred in OR, likely in the setting of HD
   and anethesia induction.  Recent echo shows area of hypokinesis
   consistent with scar which could potentially be focus.
   - per EP recs, stopped amiodarone gtt.  Assuming no further events,
   patient does not need further amiodarone treatment.
   - per EP recs, no study warranted at this time.  EP feels that even if
   an inducible VT was noted on study, they could not be sure  that this
   was the pathway responsible for the patient
s OR event, as the original
   strip from the OR is not available and could not compared to an
   inducible rhythm.
   # hypotension
 Corrected c fluids, likely due to excess volume removal
   (initially) during HD.
   # neurologic weakness
 Patient back to baseline UE strength.  CT
   C-spine shows significant narrowing, potentially old changes.
   -          Per NSGY, MRI today to reassess.
   -          Continue C-collar until cleared by NSGY.
   # Coronaries/CAD: He is s/p CABG in [**2122**] for 3 vessel disease, with
   cath [**1-/2131**] showing
   patent LIMA-LAD, occluded SVG-RCA, occluded SVG-OM1/OM33.  Patient also
   s/p NSTEMI (DES in L main) in [**2-3**].
   - aspirin, beta blocker, statin (dose was lowered temporarily while on
   amio, now back to home dose)
   # Pump: EF 40-50% with inferior & posterior hypokinesis
   # Right hip fracture: Mechanical fall from wheelchair with subsequent
   fracture. S/p ORIF by Ortho.
   -          now weight bearing
   -          physical therapy
   -          start low-dose warfarin per ortho recs to titrate to INR 1.5

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), left main descending artery stent (LMain DES), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%, decompensated heart failure (dCHF), pulmonary hypertension (pulm htn), mild aortic stenosis (AS), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with previous aortobifemoral bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hip fracture repaired mechanically, and preoperative recurrent pulseless monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient underwent cardiac surgery and experienced hypotension during hemodialysis, which responded to fluid administration. He also had recurrent pulseless VT in the operating room, likely related to hemodialysis and anesthesia induction. Recent echocardiography showed an area of hypokinesis consistent with scar tissue, which could potentially be the focus for VT. The electrophysiology (EP) recommendations included stopping amiodarone and not pursuing further studies at this time. 

The patient's other medical conditions include CAD with previous CABG, LMain DES, LVEF of 60%, dCHF, pulm htn, mild AS, PVD with previous aortobifemoral bypass, AAA repair, ESRD on"
