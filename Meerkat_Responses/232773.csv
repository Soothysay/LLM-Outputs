   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80

   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation

   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re likely MVR/AVR
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia
   -no bb for now given cardiogenic shock
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs

   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with likely STEMI. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3-vessel disease and chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery. Transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and significant aortic stenosis. The patient has been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and is planning for probable coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve repair (MVR), or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is experiencing low cardiac index, tachycardia, and elevated filling pressures, indicating a potential risk for cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and appropriate interventions such as inotropy or afterload reduction will be necessary.
2. Hemolysis: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 36% to 32%, suggesting possible hemolysis related to the IABP. It is important to trend the hemoglobin levels and follow platelet count, while sending hemolysis labs for further evaluation.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are trending down, suggesting resolving shock liver. However, close monitoring of liver"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with a likely ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have triple vessel disease with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery and significant aortic stenosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed left ventricular dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and significant aortic stenosis. The patient has been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and is planning for probable coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without aortic valve repair/replacement or mitral valve repair/replacement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 98 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 to 142/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures are 52/26 mmHg, cardiac output/index (Fick) is 6.9 L/min/4 L/min/m2, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is 47-74%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented several days after a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed triple vessel disease with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery and left ventricular dysfunction. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed significant aortic stenosis (AS), moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The patient has been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and is planning for possible coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/70 mmHg to 137/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, troponin T levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 36%"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin 80 mg daily today.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   - cont BB
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping. 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, goal neg 2 L
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -cont  BB with goal HR 90-100 (appeared to decompensate when HR in
   80
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presents with likely STEMI and subsequent catheterization showing triple vessel disease with chronic RCA occlusion. The patient has undergone transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) which revealed left ventricular dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and significant aortic stenosis (AS). The patient has also been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (normal range 90-110 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 120/70 mmHg to 137/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (normal range 12-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg (normal range 14-24 mmHg), pulmonary artery pressures are 48/28 mmHg, and cardiac index is 2.5 L/min/m².

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 36.2%, platelet count of 188 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 117 mg/dL to 123 mg/dL, troponin T levels ranging from 4.12 ng/mL to 2.80 ng/mL, and lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's plan includes ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, and no Plavix given likely surgery. The patient's cardiac index could be increased by either inotropy or afterload reduction, focusing on afterload reduction with diuresis, IABP, and nipride gtt. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia, which appears to be necessary for compensation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate may fluctuate, leading to unstable hemodynamics.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's left ventricular dysfunction and significant AS, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and the use of nephrotoxic agents like contrast during catheterization and IABP placement may worsen renal function.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and there is evidence of crackles on lung exam, indicating potential pulmonary edema.
5. Infection: Prolonged use of IABP and indwelling lines may increase the"

   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.

   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension presenting several days after a likely ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has undergone cardiac catheterization, which showed triple vessel disease (3VD) with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing left ventricular dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and significant aortic stenosis (AS). The patient is currently on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), possibly with additional valve replacement surgeries such as mitral valve repair/replacement (MVR), aortic valve replacement (AVR), or thoracic aortic valve replacement (TVR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low cardiac index and the need for afterload reduction indicate compromised cardiac function, which can lead to cardiogenic shock.
2. Hemolysis: The decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) from 36% to 32% and the use of IABP may cause hemolysis. Monitoring platelet count and sending hemolysis labs are recommended.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) suggest transaminitis, which may be related to shock liver in the setting of cardi"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin 80 mg daily today.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   - cont BB
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping. 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, goal neg 2 L
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation

   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -cont  BB with goal HR 90-100 (appeared to decompensate when HR in

   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension presenting with likely STEMI, now post cardiac catheterization showing triple vessel disease (3VD) with chronic RCA occlusion. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed left ventricular dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and significant aortic stenosis (AS). The patient underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and is planning for probable coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with possible aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve repair/replacement (MVR), and/or thoracic aortic aneurysm repair (TVR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low cardiac index and the presence of LV dysfunction, MR, TR, and AS indicate compromised cardiac function, which could lead to cardiogenic shock.
2. Hemolysis: The patient's Hct drop from 36 to 32 and the use of IABP may suggest hemolysis. Close monitoring of hemolysis labs and platelet count is necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, as evidenced by stable creatinine levels. Monitoring cre trends is important.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, likely due to resolving shock liver in the setting of cardi"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension presenting with symptoms suggestive of a STEMI. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed triple vessel disease and chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery. An echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and significant aortic stenosis. The patient has been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), possibly along with valve replacement (MVR/AVR/TVR). The patient's current condition includes pulmonary edema, anemia, transaminitis, and renal failure. The patient's blood pressure remains in the 100s despite tachycardia, and cardiac index is low. The plan is to continue afterload reduction with diuresis, IABP, and nitroprusside infusion. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and he is on beta-blockers to maintain a heart rate of 80-100 beats per minute. The patient's anemia and transaminitis appear to be resolving, and his renal function is stable. The patient's hypertension is being managed by holding home antihypertensive medications. The patient is awaiting surgery on Monday.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix.
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.

   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented several days after a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed significant aortic stenosis (AS), moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction.

The patient is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the possibility of aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to severe left main coronary artery disease (LM/3VD) and chronic RCA occlusion. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and mildly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, which may indicate ongoing hemolysis. Other lab values such as kidney function, liver function, electrolytes, and coagulation parameters are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs reveal tachycardia with a heart rate in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -cont BB
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   -follow LFTs every few days.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with likely STEMI. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed triple vessel disease with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Additionally, the patient has 4+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, and significant aortic stenosis. The patient is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with possible aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), and/or tricuspid valve repair (TVR).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/60 mmHg to 92/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin T levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and slightly low hemoglobin concentration. The patient's creatinine level is stable from yesterday, indicating chronic renal failure. The patient's liver function tests have nearly normalized.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including aspirin, heparin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and furosem"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered
 sent to outside lab [**2184-7-31**]
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation. Goal negative 1 L today.
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Leukocytosis:
   -WBC slightly increased today but no other signs of infection. Will add
   on differential to AM labs.
   -Nothing to suggest IABP infection, hemodynamics remain stable
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32> 33.3, likely related to hemolysis in setting
   of IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cr from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented several days after a likely ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed triple vessel disease with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery and left ventricular dysfunction. An echocardiogram showed moderate mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and significant aortic stenosis. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) following intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction. He is planned for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), possibly with mitral valve repair or replacement, and tricuspid valve repair.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/58 mmHg to 124/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include a new systolic murmur at the apex, mild bilateral crackles at the bases, and diminished pulses in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin T levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The patient's medical complications include leukocytosis, anemia,"
