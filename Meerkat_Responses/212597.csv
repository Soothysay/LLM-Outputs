","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, presenting with septic shock due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNR). The patient is currently on vasopressor support with levophed and vasopressin, but remains oliguric despite adequate central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) maintenance.

The patient has evidence of bilateral calyceal obstruction on renal ultrasound, which could be due to blood, pus, or noncalcified stones. There is also evidence of left hydronephrosis. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but the organism is expected to be sensitive to meropenem.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal coagulation profile with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is suspected to have post-obstructive uropathy, which may be due to bleeding, infection, or stones. This could further lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given the oliguria in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. The BUN/Cr ratio worsening despite volume repletion also"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presented with septic shock secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable on vasopressin and norepinephrine. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate. She has bilateral calyceal obstruction on ultrasound, possibly due to blood, pus, or noncalcified stones. The patient's renal function is worsening despite volume repletion, suggesting possible post-obstructive uropathy, infection, or analgesic nephropathy. She also has abnormal coagulation parameters, likely due to sepsis, and a mildly elevated troponin level. The patient's medical team is considering a renal consultation, repeat CT scan, and adjusting her medication dosages based on her renal function.

Potential Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and oliguria in the setting of sepsis and hypotension suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This could lead to further deterioration in renal function and may require dialysis.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing GNR bacteremia, which may not be fully covered by the current antibiotic therapy. There is also evidence of bilateral calyceal obstruction, which could indicate a urinary source of infection.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recently admitted with urosepsis caused by high-grade Gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia. The most likely source of infection is pyelonephritis, as indicated by echogenic material in the pelvices bilaterally and evidence of perinephric stranding on ultrasound. The patient remains oliguric and anuric despite adequate central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) after receiving 8 liters of intravenous fluid since admission. This lack of urine output is concerning for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's white blood cell count has significantly increased from 13 on admission to 56.5 now, which is concerning for possible intrarenal pus or pyelonephritis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis - The patient is already diagnosed with urosepsis due to GNR bacteremia. It is essential to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of septic shock.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) - The patient's oliguria and anuria despite adequate CVP and MAP suggest ATN. Renal consult, urology consult, and interventional radiology (IR) consult should be obtained for further management.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo F with PMH Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent UTI admitted
   with urosepsis on two pressors.
   .
   #Urosepsis - Blood cultures from admission with high grade GNR
   bacteremia, with 4/4 bottles positive in <12 hours.  Most likely source
   is pyelonephritis given echogenic material in pelvices bilaterally and
   evidence of perinephric stranding.  Other possibility could be renal
   abscess or GI source of GNR bacteremia but less likely.  Very
   concerning that she continues to be oliguric bordering on anuric
   despite adequate CVP of [**9-16**] after getting 8L IVF since admission and
   MAP of 65 on levophed/vasopressin.  Lack of urine output concerning for
   ATN.  She has also had significant increase in WBC from 13 on admission
   to 56.5 now on repeat concerning that she could have intrarenal pus [**1-7**]
   pylonephritis which is not draining [**1-7**] oliguria.
   -renal consult
   -urology consult
   -IR consult for ?perc nephrostomy tube for drainage (not indicated at
   this time per discussion with IR resident)
   -continue meropenam given ESBL Ecoli on UCX last week
   -IVF boluses with LR or sodium bicarb as needed for CVP of [**7-15**]
   -continue with levophed and vasopressin for MAP >65
   -send urine for lytes, sediment evaluation
   -consider repeat renal u/s in morning to obtain better images, CT with
   contrast would be better however will avoid given ARF
   -send stool cultures (no mention of colitis or other concerning
   intraabd source on non-con CT at OSH)
   -CXR without evidence of PNA or pulmonary source for infection
   -serial lactates -> have been trending down from peak of 5, now 1.9
   suggesting improved end organ perfusion with above management
   .
   #Acute renal failure/Oliguria - baseline creatinine 0.8, renal
   ultrasound reportedly concerning for papillary necrosis with most
   likely cause in this case being pyelonephritis, analgesics nephropathy
   (given longterm daily percocet use) or hypotension in the setting of
   sepsis.
   -IVF to maintain CVP >8
   -titrate levophed for map >65
   -renal consult, urology consult, IR consult as above
   -send urine for sediment
   -renally dose all meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-Gap metabolic acidosis - with appropriate respiratory
   compensation, at this point worsening acidosis may be due to
   significant repletion with NS since admission as well as intrinsic
   renal dysfunction and inadequate bicarb regeneration.  She also has
   diarrhea which may be contributing.
   -IVF with sodium bicarb or LR, will avoid NS
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Coagulopathy - elevated PT/PTT with INR at 1.6 from normal baseline
   likely [**1-7**] sepsis.  No evidence of DIC at this time, with stable
   platelets of 247.
   -trend daily
   -reverse with vitamin K if continues to increase (+/- FFP if concern
   for acute bleeding)
   .
   #Demand myocardial ischemia - with isolated bump in troponin on
   admission with peak of 0.26, CK and MB flat, likely due to severe
   hypotension in setting of sepsis.  Now trending down.  She has no chest
   pain or EKG changes concerning for ACS.
   -will stop checking as troponin trending down
   -repeat EKG if concern for ACS, chest pain
   .
   #FEN - hypovolemic on admission now with adequate CVP of ~10, continue
   to bolus to maintain CVP >8, replete lytes cautiously given concern for
   worsening renal failure
   -hypocalcemia -> gave calcium gluconate
   -hypokalemia -> gave KCl
   -hypomagnesemia -> replete with mag sulfate prn
   -NPO for now until stabilized

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo female with history of Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia admit with
   abdominal pain and admit with renal calculi and concern for
   pyelonephritis based on CT scan at MWH.  She was transferred here with
   Sepsis (21% bands) and likely renal source.  In this setting she did
   have recent history of E. Coli (S-gent/tobra/bactrim) urinary tract
   infection with hospital course c/b hematuria with transfusion
   required.  Of note pt. without prolonged antibiotic course (3 days
   Zosyn given).  At that hospital course papillary necrosis considered
   likely source.
   Now patient admit with Sepsis--initial Rx with IVF showing some
   improvement in hemodynamics but only transiently and sepsis catheter
   and pressors required.  She has had continued trend of increasing WBC
   count with persistent bandemia.
   1)Sepsis--The source is clearly likely from her renal collecting
   system.  The reason for such significant hematuria and persistent
   bandemia and refractory sepsis may well be persisent obstruction
   secondary to blood, or nephrolithiasis with partial obstructions with
   stones.  In the setting of recent antibiotics there may well be
   resistant bacteria present.  As far as undrained source there is clear
   concern based on ultrasound.  Overall she has some volume resuscitation
   completed and CVP is considered
optimal
 but with inspiratory fall
   there is a suggestion of some possible need for increased volume
   support.
   -Levo/Vasopressin
to continue with titration to adequate perfusion
   -Meropenem for antibiotics given reasonable coverage
   -Avoid aminoglycosides given worsening renal failure but do need E.
   Coli sensitivies as soon as possible.
   -IVF bolus today for decrease in MAP
which will be driven by MAP
   changes and CVP goal of 12
   -LR as fluid of choice
   -Will check CvO2 to give measure of delivery as we have some concern
   for cardiac compromise with exam suggesting cool extremities.
   -Will check [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim for eval of possible adrenal insufficiency
   -Will add Flagyl for possible C. Diff
   -Will discuss with others but will repeat renal ultrasound and evaluate
   for worsening of evidence of obstruction.
   -Additional issue is possible abscess for drainage which will have to
   be reviewed with radiology directly.
   -Will review primary data from imaging as well.
   2)Acute Renal Failure
This may well be ATN in the setting of sepsis and
   hypotension.  We would raise the issue of possible obstruction and
   there may well be a pre-renal picture as well.  To define primary
   contributors we will
   -Eval with repeat ultrasound to look for worsening obstruction
   -Check renal lytes for evidence of inadequate perfusion
   -Need a direct evaluation of urine for evidence of ATN
   -Will need to maintain adequate perfusion and drainage in the settin of
   ongoing renal impairment.
   2.5)Non-gap metabolic acidosis
will avoid NaCl where possible and given
   preserved hepatic function will utilize LR as possible.
   3)Coagulopathy-[**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to sepsis
replace factors with FFP if
   further increase seen and/or bleeding in renal system suggested.
   4)Anemia
no acute drop, may have been in the setting of previous blood
   loss, chronic iron deficiency anemia and acute sepsis.
   5)Myocardial Ischemia
patient has realy R-wave progression and inferior
   Q-waves which are non-significant by voltage criteria but raises
   concern in the setting of evidence of inadequate perfusion suggested by
   peripheral exam will

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia admitted with abdominal pain and renal calculi. She was transferred to the ICU with sepsis, likely originating from the renal system. The patient had a recent urinary tract infection caused by E. Coli and required transfusion. She was initially treated with IV fluids but required sepsis catheter placement and pressors for hemodynamic stability. The patient has shown an increasing white blood cell count with persistent bandemia, indicating ongoing infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The source of sepsis is believed to be from the renal collecting system, possibly due to persistent obstruction secondary to blood or nephrolithiasis with partial obstructions. The patient's refractory sepsis may be attributed to recent antibiotic use leading to resistant bacteria. There is concern for an undrained source based on ultrasound findings.
2. Acute Renal Failure: This may be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. Obstruction is also a concern, and further evaluation with repeat ultrasound and renal function tests is recommended.
3. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient will be managed by avoiding NaCl and utilizing LR as much as possible.
4. Coagulopathy: Replacing factors with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is advised if further increase in coagulation parameters"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who was admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with urosepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with septic shock. She is stable on levophed and vasopressin but remains oliguric despite adequate central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The patient has a bacterial infection caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR), which is sensitive to meropenem. The source of infection is suspected to be urinary. An ultrasound showed evidence of bilateral calyceal obstruction by blood, pus, or noncalcified stones.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to the GNR bacteremia. This condition can progress and lead to septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is oliguric, indicating reduced urine output. This could be due to post-obstructive uropathy caused by the bilateral calyceal obstruction or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis and hypotension. Further evaluation of renal function and measures to prevent further kidney damage are necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, including an elevated international normalized ratio (INR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who presented with septic shock secondary to E. Coli bacteremia and left hydronephrosis. The patient has shown clinical improvement with better peripheral perfusion and stable hemodynamics. However, the patient continues to have leukocytosis despite clinical improvement and has a positive IgM spike. The patient's renal function is worsening with an increasing creatinine level. There are also concerns regarding the possibility of analgesic nephropathy, papillary necrosis, or malignancy contributing to the renal failure. The patient has a coagulopathy with a stable INR but decreasing platelet count. There is no evidence of acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's anemia is trending down, and there are infrequent loose stools, which may suggest Clostridium difficile infection. However, the toxin assay is negative. The patient does not exhibit any symptoms of myocardial ischemia, and an MI has been ruled out. The patient's fluid and electrolyte balance needs to be closely monitored due to diminished renal function."

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and recent urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with urosepsis.
- The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which is stable despite being on levophed and vasopressin. She is oliguric despite maintaining adequate central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP).
- There is evidence of bilateral calyceal obstruction by blood, pus, or noncalcified stones on ultrasound (U/S).
- The patient's blood culture shows a gram-negative bacteremia, with a pending identification of the specific organism. The organism is sensitive to meropenem.
- The patient is suspected to have acute kidney injury (AKI), possibly due to post-obstructive uropathy, bleeding, infection, or stones based on U/S findings. This may also be an element of analgesic nephropathy, as the patient was taking pain medications for her hip.
- The patient's BUN/creatinine levels are worsening despite volume repletion, suggesting against pre-renal physiology. Oliguria in the setting of sepsis and hypotension suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, including an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo female admit with sepsis following incomplete response to
   treatment for urinary tract infection in past with course complicated
   by signficant hematuria.  The issue was raised as to possible abscess
   which has been fully considered with Urology and Renal assistance and
   given clinical improvement this seems less likely in the setting of
   antibiotic therapy but further imaging when clinically appropriate
   would be suggested.  The specific source of her papillary necrosis
   remains unclear and infiltrative diseases of the kidney are also under
   consideration.
   1)Sepsis
Improved with antibiotic Rx
   -Await GNR speciation
   -CVP goal [**7-15**] and will wean as possible
   -Meropenem to continue
   -[**Last Name (un) **] stim reassuring
   -Will follow up with culture results
   2)Leukocytosis-
   -She retains a significantly elevated WBC count.  This is in the
   setting of 3% bands.  This is possibly ongoing response to incompletely
   treated infection with abscess and/or C-Diff considered most likely.
   In addition, this may well be a primary source from myeloid cell line
   triggered by infectious insult but this was not previously defined.
   -MRI to eval better for focal collection
   -TWBC scan would be reasonable to consider if unable to tolerate MRI
   scan
   -Continue with Flagyl for C-Diff treatment
   -Will need to review smear with Heme to consider if cell differential
   represents accurate counts.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Has had some continued worsening of creatinine and remains oliguric at
   this time
   -Will maintain adequate prefusion and hope for, at least, ATN component
   to resolve although this is a mild contribution to the rnal failure.
   -Will minimize contrast
   3)Hematuria
minimal at this time
will maintain foley support

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis following an incomplete response to treatment for a urinary tract infection. The patient has been experiencing significant hematuria, and there are concerns about possible abscess formation. However, with clinical improvement after antibiotic therapy, the likelihood of an abscess seems less likely.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and hematuria. The sepsis has improved with antibiotic treatment, but the patient still has a significantly elevated white blood cell count, possibly due to an ongoing response to an incompletely treated infection or a primary source from the myeloid cell line triggered by the infectious insult. An MRI scan is recommended to evaluate for any focal collection, and a TWBC scan may be considered if the patient cannot tolerate an MRI. Flagyl will continue to be administered for C-Diff treatment, and the cell differential will be reviewed to consider if it represents accurate counts.

The patient's acute renal failure has shown some worsening, with continued oliguria. Efforts will be made to maintain adequate perfusion and hope for resolution of the renal failure, potentially including ATN (acute tubular necrosis). Contrast use will be minimized. The patient's hematuria is minimal at this time, and Foley support will be maintained.

In the ICU, the patient is on full code status, and efforts will be made to start PO feeds. The patient"

   somnolence.
   .
   #Septic shock
 E.Coli bacteremia, presumed urinary source b/c +U/A.
   HD stable off pressors with improved urine output.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on sensitivity data (day [**3-19**] of
   ABX); requested that meropenem susceptibilty testing be performed on
   isolate
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection;
   hypoxia on ABG c/w volume overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR,
   cannot r/o underlying PNA but no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM to r/o bleed, incr. ICP; defer LP unless mental
   status worsens or focal findings on exam
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status

   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, may represent leukemoid rxn in the
   setting of sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum
   viscosity WNL
   -heme to eval. smear
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   -Prelim MR read - no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or
   perinephric collection; f/u final read
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF

   Comments:
   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds , ICU
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who was admitted to the ICU with a partially treated urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia. The patient's clinical condition has improved overall, but she remains lethargic and somnolent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had septic shock due to E. Coli bacteremia, which has been partially treated. There is a risk of recurrence or progression of sepsis.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing increased somnolence and lethargy, suggestive of delirium. This may be due to toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection, hypoxia, or bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a high percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). This may represent a leukemoid reaction in the setting of sepsis.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with an improvement in creatinine levels from 2.0 to 1.7. The cause of AKI is suspected to be resolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis and hypotension. However, the patient also has proteinuria consistent with nephrotic syndrome and rare eosinophils in the urine, which may suggest allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
5. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to renal bicarbonate losses or failure of bicarbonate secretion. The underlying cause of this acidosis needs further evaluation.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an improving coagulopathy, as indicated by a decreasing INR. However, the platelet count is also trending down. This requires close monitoring, and vitamin K reversal should be considered if necessary.
7. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, which is likely due to dilutional effects from aggressive volume repletion. There is no evidence of acute bleeding.
8. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has infrequent loose stools, but the C. diff toxin assay is negative twice. This suggests that discontinuation of metronidazole, which was given for the UTI, may be appropriate.
9. Feeding and nutrition: The patient's mental status needs to be assessed before starting a peroral (PO) diet. If the mental status does not improve, nasogastric (NG) tube feeding may be considered.
10. Fluid and electrolyte management: The patient's fluid status needs close monitoring, with goals of even to -500 cc/day fluid balance. Electrolytes should be followed carefully,"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia,
   overally clinically improved but with persistent delirium.
   .
   #Septic shock
 Clinically no longer in shock, HD stable off pressors
   with improved UOP, renal function; [**1-7**] E.Coli bacteremia, presumed
   urinary source b/c +U/A.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on initial sensitivity data (day
   [**3-19**] of ABX); meropenem susceptibility added on later
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and
   other markers of coagulopathy stable
   -recheck platelets in PM
   -consider changing zosyn back to [**Last Name (un) 430**] if plts cont. to fall (c/f
   PCN-induced thrombocytopenia)
   -d/c PPI
   -venodynes for DVT PPx
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection
   and benzos given for sedation for MRI; hypoxia on ABG c/w volume
   overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR, cannot r/o underlying PNA but
   no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM but low suspicion for bleed/CVA, incr. ICP; defer LP
   unless mental status worsens or focal findings on PE
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, likely leukemoid rxn in the setting of
   sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum viscosity WNL
   -heme thought smear was c/w leukemoid rxn
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   -cont. maintenance IVF + bicarb
   -MR did not reveal hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or perinephric
   collection
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF
   -check urine AG, ph, FeHCO3 to characterize RTA: K has been low c/w
   type II RTA and some causes type I
   -cont. D5+150 mEq HCO3 @ maintenance
   .
   #Anemia
 stable, trended down in the setting of volume repletion; no
   s/sx acute bleeding
   -T&C, x-fuse for Hct < 21%

   #C. diff
 infrequent loose BM

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock caused by E. Coli bacteremia. She has shown clinical improvement but remains delirious. The patient's medical history includes thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), non-gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. Her current condition includes ongoing volume overload, bilateral pleural effusions, and a recent urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient continues to be somnolent and lethargic with persistent delirium. The cause could be toxic encephalopathy due to infection and benzodiazepine sedation for MRI.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending downward since admission. Possible causes include medication-induced thrombocytopenia (PPI vs. ABX), sepsis, or an underlying condition like HIT or DIC.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count, which is likely due to a leukemoid reaction secondary to sepsis.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient initially had elevated creatinine levels, but they have improved. The cause of ARF may be resolving acute tubular necrosis (AT"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo female admit with sepsis and urinary source identified now with
   concerning findings of worsening mental status and persistent acidosis
   with hypoxemia.  Her markedly elevated WBC count has started to
   decrease and review of smear by hematology suggests leukemoid
   reaction.
   Sepsis
improving with antibiotics and E. Coli identified on culture
   -Zosyn to continue
   -Flagyl to go to po with concern for C. Diff
   -Reasonable to D/C A-line
   Altered mental status-Her exam is consistent with encephalopathy which
   is dynamic consitent with delirium.
   -Minimize sedating medications
   -Rx underlying infection
   -Head CT for focal findings
   -Likely to improve as underlying issues resolve.
   Hypoxemia
Pulmonary infiltrate

 crackles on exam
   throughout all lung fields which raises the question of atelectasis-the
   effusions do raise the question of some component of volume overload.

   -Change PPI
   -Consider HIT and Rx based on trend today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted with sepsis and a urinary source identified. She has worsening mental status, persistent acidemia, and hypoxemia. Her white blood cell count is markedly elevated, suggesting a leukemoid reaction. The patient is improving with antibiotics, but still shows signs of infection. She also has altered mental status, likely due to encephalopathy or delirium. Other concerns include pulmonary infiltrate with crackles throughout the lung fields, possible atelectasis, and volume overload. There is also a possibility of thrombocytopenia, potentially due to sepsis or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is improving with antibiotics. However, continued infection can lead to further complications.
2. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient's worsening mental status and decreased sensorium indicate encephalopathy or delirium. This condition needs to be closely monitored and underlying causes addressed.
3. Pulmonary Infiltrate/Atelectasis: The presence of crackles throughout the lung fields suggests pulmonary infiltrate, possibly atelectasis. This may cause hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
4. Volume Overload: The patient's increased bilateral effusion on chest X-ray raises the question of volume overload. Maintaining a negative fluid balance is crucial to prevent"

   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia,
   overally clinically improved but with persistent delirium.
   .
   #Septic shock
 Clinically no longer in shock, HD stable off pressors
   with improved UOP, renal function; [**1-7**] E.Coli bacteremia, presumed
   urinary source b/c +U/A.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on initial sensitivity data (day
   [**3-19**] of ABX); meropenem susceptibility added on later
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and
   other markers of coagulopathy stable
   -recheck platelets in PM
   -consider changing zosyn back to [**Last Name (un) 430**] if plts cont. to fall (c/f
   PCN-induced thrombocytopenia)
   -d/c PPI
   -venodynes for DVT PPx
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection
   and benzos given for sedation for MRI; hypoxia on ABG c/w volume
   overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR, cannot r/o underlying PNA but
   no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM but low suspicion for bleed/CVA, incr. ICP; defer LP
   unless mental status worsens or focal findings on PE
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status

 Trending down, likely leukemoid rxn in the setting of
   sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum viscosity WNL
   -heme thought smear was c/w leukemoid rxn
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]

   -MR did not reveal hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or perinephric
   collection
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presented with urosepsis and delirium. She has been treated for an E. coli bacteremia, presumed to be of urinary origin. The patient's condition has improved, but she still experiences persistent delirium. The assessment includes septic shock, thrombocytopenia, delirium, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, non-gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, Clostridium difficile infection, and fever/neutropenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, but is now clinically improved and no longer in shock. However, there is still a risk of recurrence or complications related to the underlying infection.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a decreasing platelet count, which may be medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX) or due to sepsis. Continuous monitoring of platelets is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Delirium: The patient continues to experience persistent delirium, which could be related to toxic encephalopathy from infection and benzodiazepine use for sedation. Further evaluation and management are needed to improve mental status.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a high percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia,
   overally clinically improved but with persistent delirium.
   .
   #Septic shock
 Clinically no longer in shock, HD stable off pressors
   with improved UOP, renal function; [**1-7**] E.Coli bacteremia, presumed
   urinary source b/c +U/A.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on initial sensitivity data (day
   [**3-19**] of ABX); meropenem susceptibility added on later
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and
   other markers of coagulopathy stable
   -recheck platelets in PM
   -consider changing zosyn back to [**Last Name (un) 430**] if plts cont. to fall (c/f
   PCN-induced thrombocytopenia)
   -d/c PPI
   -venodynes for DVT PPx
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection
   and benzos given for sedation for MRI; hypoxia on ABG c/w volume
   overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR, cannot r/o underlying PNA but
   no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM but low suspicion for bleed/CVA, incr. ICP; defer LP
   unless mental status worsens or focal findings on PE
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, likely leukemoid rxn in the setting of
   sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum viscosity WNL
   -heme thought smear was c/w leukemoid rxn
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   -cont. maintenance IVF + bicarb
   -MR did not reveal hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or perinephric
   collection
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF
   -check urine AG, ph, FeHCO3 to characterize RTA: K has been low c/w
   type II RTA and some causes type I
   -cont. D5+150 mEq HCO3 @ maintenance
   .
   #Anemia
 stable, trended down in the setting of volume repletion; no
   s/sx acute bleeding
   -T&C, x-fuse for Hct < 21%
   .
   #C. diff
 infrequent loose BM
s, abd exam benign; toxin assay neg x 2
   -d/c flagyl
   .
   #F/E/N
   -if mental status improves, start PO diet; otherwise consider starting
   NG TF
   -volume goal: even to -500 cc/day
   -D5W+150 mEq bicarb @ 125 cc/hr
   -follow lytes [**Hospital1 **], replete PRN with caution given diminished renal fxn
   .
   #PPx
 venodynes, does not need GI PPx clinically improved and will
   have nutrition today
   .
   #ACCESS  - R IJ, PIV, L rad A-line; consider d/c

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who has been admitted to the ICU due to septic shock caused by an E. coli bacteremia. The patient is currently clinically improved but still experiencing persistent delirium.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending downward since admission, which may be medication-induced or due to sepsis. There is a possibility of changing zosyn back to another antibiotic if the platelets continue to fall.

2. Delirium: The patient is more somnolent and lethargic with a non-focal exam. It is suspected that toxic encephalopathy may be present in the setting of infection and benzodiazepine use for sedation. Hypoxia on ABG is also noted, which could be related to volume overload and bilateral pleural effusions on CXR. Further evaluation is needed to rule out underlying pneumonia, and broadening ABX to cover MRSA is being considered if there is an increased oxygen requirement or purulent sputum.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely as a reaction to sepsis. This is trending down, and no further workup is planned at this time.

4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has improved from 2.0"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who was admitted with urosepsis and delirium. She has a history of recent partially-treated urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia. The patient's clinical condition has improved, but she still experiences persistent delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming infection leading to systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction. However, the patient is now clinically improved and no longer in shock.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a decreasing platelet count since admission, which can be medication-induced or due to sepsis. The trend of increasing platelets suggests that the medication may be the cause. It is important to monitor the platelet count daily and discontinue the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that may be contributing to this condition.

3. Delirium: The patient continues to experience confusion, despite some improvement in somnolence and lethargy. Delirium can be caused by various factors such as infection, medication, or hypoxia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis, which is an increased white blood cell count. This"

 Clinically no longer in shock, HD stable off pressors
   with improved UOP, renal function; [**1-7**] E.Coli bacteremia, presumed
   urinary source b/c +U/A.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on initial sensitivity data (day

   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and
   other markers of coagulopathy stable
   -recheck platelets in PM
   -consider changing zosyn back to [**Last Name (un) 430**] if plts cont. to fall (c/f
   PCN-induced thrombocytopenia)
   -d/c PPI
   -venodynes for DVT PPx
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection
   and benzos given for sedation for MRI; hypoxia on ABG c/w volume
   overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR, cannot r/o underlying PNA but
   no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM but low suspicion for bleed/CVA, incr. ICP; defer LP
   unless mental status worsens or focal findings on PE
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, likely leukemoid rxn in the setting of
   sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum viscosity WNL
   -heme thought smear was c/w leukemoid rxn
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who was admitted with urosepsis and delirium. The patient had a partially-treated urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with septic shock in the setting of E. coli bacteremia. She has shown overall clinical improvement but continues to experience persistent delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, but is now clinically stable off pressors with improved urine output and renal function. However, there is a possibility of recurrence if the infection is not adequately controlled.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending downward since admission. This could be due to medication-induced thrombocytopenia (PPI or ABX), sepsis, or other causes. Continuous monitoring of platelets is recommended, and consideration should be given to changing antibiotics if necessary.

3. Delirium: The patient is somnolent and lethargic, but without focal exam findings or meningismus. Toxic encephalopathy is suspected in the setting of infection and benzodiazepine use for sedation. Further evaluation for underlying pneumonia is needed, but fever and cough are absent. Broadening antibiotic coverage to include MRSA may be necessary if there is an increased oxygen requirement or purulent sputum."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo admit with urosepsis which has shown substantial improvement and
   now has trend down in WBC count and good tolerance of diuresis and
   improving mental status overall.  Her CXR would endorse improved volume
   status overall.
   Sepsis-
   -Zosyn x 14 days
   -Continue to promote diuresis
   -Appears to be stabilitzed
   Acute Renal Failure-
   Creatinine improving substantially
   Remarable improvement in uring flow
   Will need follow up evaluation of hematuria based on long term
   course
this may well be related to infection and papillary necrosis
   Altered Mental Status-
   Clearing with improvement in all other parameters
   Continue to orient
   Start with mobilization and ambulation
   Thrombocytopenia
Stabilized at 125 without intervention, medications
   minimized, no concern for HIT
   ICU
Will move to PICC placement and D/C all other lines

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has shown improvement in creatinine levels and urine flow, indicating some recovery. However, further evaluation of hematuria is necessary, which may be related to infection and papillary necrosis. Monitoring kidney function and addressing any ongoing renal issues will be crucial.
2. Altered Mental Status: Although the patient's mental"
