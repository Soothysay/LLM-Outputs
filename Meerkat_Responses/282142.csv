 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   Pt is [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o AVR, A fib, dCHF, CABG, HTN, and right leg
   cellulitis x1 transferred to the MICU after increased HRs to 120-130s
   overnight, SBP to 170s, increased fatigue, 3 episodes of chest pain,
   and more elevated WBC in the setting of hemoconcentration. Ddx:
   Tachycardia could be due to dehydration in the setting of c diff and
   developing sepsis and concern for PE (pockets of edema on right
   ankle/shin, new oxygen requirement). CP this am could be due to demand
   ischemia in the setting of HTN and increased HR.
   PE ruled out by CTA.
   .
   #. New oxygen requirement: o2 sat dropped to somewhere in 80s when 2L
   of NC removed on floor and pt tachypnic to high 30s/low 40s. Thus
   concern for PE. ? if pt could also have aspirated. No clear PNA on CXR.
   ABG overnight on RA with p02 67 and repeat on 2L with p02 of 82.
   D-dimer 5840. CTA ruled out PE
 stopped heparin gtt o/n. SpO2 drops
   quickly if O2 removed. Could be due to dCHF, hypertension, volume
   overload.
   -f/u final read of CTA and LE U/S
   -hold on diuresis or hydration for now give tenuous volume status
   (appears dehydrated, with diarrhea, but with crackles on exam)
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -optimize BP control; concern HTN could be worsening dCHF and hence
   causing crackles and O2 requirement
   .
   #. Diarrhea: c diff +. WBC elevated on admission but increased WBC
   likley due to hemoconcentration but infection could also be worsening.
   However lactate 1.3 at 3am. Abd exam benign. 4 loose BM yesterday (of
   note pt reports bloody BMs at home). UOP fine but got lasix o/n.
   Improving diarrhea today.
   -treat with solely PO flagyl (d/c vanco)
   -monitor fever curve, currently afebrile
   -monitor abd exam
   -follow WBC daily
   -f/u blood cultures
   .
   #. HTN: Hypertensive to 180s overnight. Non-responsive to metoprolol,
   responsive to labetalol.
   - start labetalol 400mg po tid for goal SBP<160
   - consider calcium channel blocker
   - hold on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] given contrast load to kidneys yesterday
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Most likely due to being dry in the setting of c diff.
   PE is also of concern given tachycardia, new o2 reuirement, and right
   heart strain on EKG however that is present on EKG from [**10-14**].  D-dimer
   came back as 5840 but pt is chronically ill. PE ruled out. Not tachy
   this AM.
   -Pain control
   -Treat BP
   -Hold on diuresis or fluid resuscitation for now
   .
   #. h/o a fib:
   -continue amiodarone
   .
   #. Fatigue: Pt with eyes closed in bed but will open them and talk to
   you when asked. Pt is A & 0 x3.  UE and LE strength 4/5 but symmetric
   bilaterally. Today, patient A&O x3, alert, interactive, appropriate.
   - monitor
   - treat infection
   .
   #. Chest pain: Likely demand related to HTN and tachycardia. One
   episode of chest pressure on [**12-24**] and 2 episodes [**12-25**]. Got ASA 325.
   No CP since arrival in the MICU.
   - monitor
   -continue ASA, statin, (on amiodarone at home)
   .
   #. dCHF: CXR overnight (prior to lasix) actually looks better compared
   to most recent CXR. Have little concern for volume overload at this
   time- would not repeat lasix especially if chance of PE given could be
   preload dependent.
   -monitor I/Os

   Code status: DNR / DNI
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement, congestive heart failure, coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, and right leg cellulitis. She was admitted to the MICU due to increased heart rate (120-130s), high blood pressure (170s), fatigue, chest pain, and elevated white blood cell count.

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate potential medical complications. These include respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypertension, alteration in nutrition, and a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's oxygen saturation dropped quickly when the oxygen supply was removed, which could be due to decompensated congestive heart failure (dCHF) or volume overload.

The patient also has diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile infection, as indicated by positive stool culture. Her abdominal examination is benign, and she has been improving in terms of diarrhea. The elevated white blood cell count may be due to hemoconcentration or an ongoing infection.

The patient's tachycardia could be related to dehydration in the setting of C. difficile infection or developing sepsis. However, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) ruled out PE.

The patient's blood pressure is uncontrolled and requires further management. Her chest pain is likely demand-related to hypertension and tachycardia. She is currently on amiodarone for atrial fibr"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension, and right leg cellulitis. She was admitted to the MICU due to increased heart rate (120-130s), elevated blood pressure (170s), increased fatigue, chest pain, and elevated white blood cell count.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, hypertension, benign alteration in nutrition, and possible pneumonia. She is hypotensive and hypertensive, with a blood pressure ranging from 160s to 170s. Her oxygen saturation is at 94% on a nasal cannula, and she requires supplemental oxygen.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of WBC (29.7), Hct (44.9), and Plt (325), with decreased levels of Cr (1.1) and TropT (<0.01). The D-dimer level is 5840, which is concerning for pulmonary embolism (PE), although a CT angiogram ruled out PE.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including tachycardia, potential PE, diarrhea (C. diff positive), and hypertension. The tachycardia is likely due to dehydration, but PE is also a concern given the new oxygen requirement and right heart strain on EKG. The elevated D-dimer further supports the concern"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia and tachycardia. She has a history of C. diff, mild CHF, and overnight has been tachycardic and hypertensive. The patient responded to IV labetolol. She is also hypokalemic. The patient underwent several tests, including an ultrasound, nasal swab, blood cultures, and urine culture. Her vital signs are stable, and she is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and HCO3- of 81 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bibasilar region of her chest, warm skin, and attentive mental status. Her lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and troponin-T levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and crackles on exam indicate the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support are necessary.
2. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure may require further evaluation and management to prevent complications associated with chronic hypertension.
3. C. diff infection: The patient's history of C. diff and the presence of diarrhea warrant ongoing treatment and precautions to prevent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery bypass grafting, hypertension, and right leg cellulitis. She was admitted to the MICU due to increased heart rate (120-130s), elevated blood pressure (170s), fatigue, chest pain, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped in the 80s when the nasal cannula was removed, leading to concern for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). However, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) ruled out PE. The patient's chest X-ray showed bilateral crackles at the bases, and she has mild interlobular thickening suggestive of congestive heart failure. The patient's C. difficile test is positive. She is currently on several medications including amiodarone, aspirin, and a statin. The patient's D-dimer level is 5840, which is elevated but may not be significant given her chronic illness.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing increased respiratory distress, as indicated by her low oxygen saturation levels and the need for supplemental oxygen. The crackles on her chest X-ray suggest fluid accumulation in her lungs, which could be due to congestive heart failure or a potential PE.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, reaching levels of 180"

 .H/O HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   Pt is [**Age over 90 **] yo female with h/o AVR, A fib, dCHF, CABG, HTN, and right leg
   cellulitis x1 transferred to the MICU after increased HRs to 120-130s
   overnight, SBP to 170s, increased fatigue, 3 episodes of chest pain,
   and more elevated WBC in the setting of hemoconcentration. Ddx:
   Tachycardia could be due to dehydration in the setting of c diff and
   developing sepsis and concern for PE (pockets of edema on right
   ankle/shin, new oxygen requirement). CP this am could be due to demand
   ischemia in the setting of HTN and increased HR.  PE ruled out by CTA.
   .
   #. New oxygen requirement: o2 sat dropped to somewhere in 80s when 2L
   of NC removed on floor and pt tachypnic to high 30s/low 40s. Thus
   concern for PE. ? if pt could also have aspirated. No clear PNA on CXR.
   ABG overnight on RA with p02 67 and repeat on 2L with p02 of 82.
   D-dimer 5840. CTA ruled out PE
 stopped heparin gtt o/n. SpO2 drops
   quickly if O2 removed. Suspect O2 requirement is due to diastolic CHF,
   with pt
s considerable kyphosis contributing to hypoxia.
   -f/u final read of CTA
   -hold on diuresis or hydration for now give tenuous volume status
   -optimize BP/HR control; HTN and tachycardia could be worsening dCHF
   and hence resulting in crackles and O2 requirement
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #. Diarrhea: c diff +. WBC elevated on admission but increased WBC
   likley due to hemoconcentration but infection could also be worsening.
   However lactate 1.3 at 3am. Abd exam benign. 4 loose BM yesterday (of
   note pt reports bloody BMs at home). UOP fine but got lasix o/n.
   Improving diarrhea today.

   #. HTN: Hypertensive to 180s overnight. Non-responsive to metoprolol,
   exquisitely responsive to Labetalol. Became hypotensive in setting of
   Labetolol 300mg PO x1.
   - decreased labetalol from 300mg TID to 100mg PO BID for goal SBP<160,
   will cont to closely monitor BP
   - could consider calcium channel blocker
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Most likely due to being dehydrated in the setting of c
   diff.  PE was also of concern given tachycardia, new o2 reuirement, and
   right heart strain on EKG however that is present on EKG from [**10-14**].
   D-dimer came back as 5840 but pt is chronically ill. PE ruled out with
   CTA chest. Not tachy this AM. S/p heparin drip.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery bypass grafting, hypertension, and right leg cellulitis. She was admitted to the MICU due to increased heart rates, high blood pressure, fatigue, chest pain, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient has respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, and her oxygen requirement is likely due to diastolic CHF with kyphosis contributing to hypoxia. She also has Clostridium difficile infection, dehydration, tachycardia, hypertension, and potential pulmonary embolism ruled out by CTA. Other conditions include atrial fibrillation, chest pain, diastolic congestive heart failure, and right lower extremity wound.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute but not ARDS. Her oxygen requirement is likely due to diastolic CHF, with kyphosis contributing to hypoxia.
2. Clostridium difficile Infection (C. diff): The patient has a positive test for C. diff, which can cause diarrhea and increase the risk of dehydration.
3. Dehydration: The patient is dehydrated in the setting of C. diff and developing sepsis. This can lead to hypotension and decreased urine output.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is frequently"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxemia. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient experienced some hypertension (HOTN) yesterday after receiving a dose of labetalol and got IV fluid boluses. Her blood pressure improved this morning, along with her urine output. The patient has a history of hypertension, benign alteration in nutrition, and is currently receiving various medications including Effort, simvastatin, vitamin D, aspirin, and Flagyl. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted cardiovascular symptoms. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 68 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 107/53 to 167/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,614 mL and output of 1,440 mL since midnight. 

Physical examination reveals a thin appearance, normal eyes and conjunctiva, normal cardiovascular examination with regular heart sounds, peripheral pulses within normal limits, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, warm skin, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination was not assessed. 

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, white blood cell count of 29.7 K/uL, hematocrit of 44.9%, platelet count of 214 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 127 to 226 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits. 

The patient's respiratory failure has improved, with decreased crackles on lung examination. She remains mildly hypoxemic. The patient's hypertension and hypoxemia are still present but have shown improvement. The patient's code status is DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and DNI (Do Not Intubate), and she is planned to be transferred to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure has improved, but she still remains mildly hypoxemic. Continued monitoring and support may be required to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, indicating ongoing hypertension. Further management and control of blood pressure are necessary to prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is still below normal levels, indicating ongoing hypoxemia. Continuous monitoring and potential interventions to improve oxygenation are required.
4. Delirium or Cognitive Impairment: The patient's neurologic examination was not assessed, which raises concern for possible delirium or cognitive impairment. Close observation and appropriate management to prevent further decline in mental status may be needed.
