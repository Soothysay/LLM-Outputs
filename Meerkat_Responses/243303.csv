The patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and emergent bronchoscopy. She has a history of breast cancer and chemotherapy. The patient presented with acute hypoxia and evidence of upper airway obstruction, possibly due to mucus plugging or malfunction of the Y-stent. Other possible causes include pneumonia, pulmonary thromboembolism, or pneumothorax, but these are less likely.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 97.9°F, blood pressure ranging from 112-160/60-90 mmHg, heart rate of 130 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99% on 2 liters of oxygen. The patient is cachectic and somnolent but able to follow commands. Her lungs are clearer, and she has a positive bowel sounds. The patient has a central line, indwelling port (PortaCath), and a feeding tube in place.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17,000 K/uL, hemoglobin of 36.1 g/dL, platelet count of 587 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and potassium levels within normal range. The chest X-ray did not reveal any focal infiltrate, and there is no"

","The patient is a 71-year-old white female with a history of esophageal cancer. She was admitted to the hospital due to respiratory distress and underwent an emergent bronchoscopy. The patient has been experiencing episodes of agitation, and there is a concern for medication-induced agitation due to a paradoxical reaction to ativan in the past. The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with coarse rhonchi and stridor, indicating possible upper airway obstruction or mucus plugging. 

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.0 K/uL, which may be due to aspiration pneumonitis. However, the patient is afebrile and does not show any signs of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. Therefore, it is recommended to continue monitoring the WBC count and send blood cultures, urine cultures, and repeat the chest X-ray in the morning. 

The patient also has tachycardia, which could be attributed to agitation, respiratory distress, or dehydration. An ECG should be obtained to further evaluate the heart rhythm. 

In terms of management, the patient requires respiratory support with nebulized treatments and a pulmonary toilet. Antibiotic therapy with moxifloxacin should be continued for three more days.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old white female with a history of esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and emergent bronchoscopy. She was previously admitted to the NEB and another hospital for chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, leukocytosis, pain control, tachycardia, agitation, esophageal cancer, and nausea/vomiting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presents with acute hypoxia and evidence of upper airway obstruction, which could be due to mucus plugging, malfunction of the Y-stent, malposition or obstruction. Other possibilities include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to reactive leukocytosis from aspiration pneumonitis or another underlying cause. It is important to monitor the patient's condition and trends in white blood cell count, as well as follow up with blood cultures and urinalysis.
3. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be medication-induced. Possible causes include paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines or poor pain control. Haldol has been ordered for agitation, and the patient's pain management regimen will be re-evaluated after bronchoscopy.
4. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing tach"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old white female with a history of esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and bronchoscopy. She was previously admitted to the NEB and transferred to [Hospital 1] for chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient presents with acute hypoxia and evidence of upper airway obstruction, concerning for mucus plugging or malfunction of the Y-stent. Other possibilities include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax. The patient is able to maintain oxygen saturation at 100%. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has respiratory distress with hypoxia and evidence of upper airway obstruction. An emergent bronchoscopy is planned to assess and clear any potential obstruction or malposition of the Y-stent.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to a reactive response or aspiration pneumonitis. Monitoring of the white blood cell count and sending blood cultures and urine cultures is planned.
3. Agitation: The patient is agitated, possibly due to medication-induced effects. Holding on ativan and using haldol for agitation is recommended.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has a high heart rate, likely due to agitation, respiratory distress, and dehydration. An ECG and IV fluids will be ordered to further evaluate the cause.

","Summary:
The patient is a frail and thin individual who is agitated at times. They have a history of multiple allergies, including codeine, erythromycin, penicillins, and aspirin. The patient has been experiencing episodes of nausea and vomiting, for which they were given Zofran and Reglan. However, the patient had a dystonic reaction to Reglan, so it was discontinued. The patient also received Dilaudid 1mg every 3 hours as needed for breakthrough pain, and their methadone dose was increased to 40mg three times a day. They were restarted on home remeron and received Haldol 0.5 IV at night, which had a good effect.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8C (98.2F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 160/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results are ///28/. The patient has coarse rhonchi and stridor in their lungs, as well as diffuse tenderness in the abdomen without rebound or guarding. They have midline staples and a feeding tube in place. There are no obvious deformities in the patient's extremities or any cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.0 and 16.4, hemoglobin (Hct) of 36.1 and 33.9, platelet count (Plt) of 587 and 505, creatinine (Cr) of 0.4 and 0.5, and glucose level of 162 and 142. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR, differential white blood cell count, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, leukocytosis, pain control issues (both acute and chronic), and tachycardia. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention."

The patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She has a history of codeine allergy, nausea/vomiting, severe pain, erythromycin base allergy, penicillins allergy, anaphylaxis, iodine allergy, phenothiazines allergy, confusion/delirium, and aspirin allergy. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for episodes of nausea/vomiting.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/81 mmHg to 172/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, leukocytosis, pain control issues, tachycardia, agitation, and esophageal cancer. The plan includes addressing the respiratory distress by continuing nebs, monitoring the respiratory status, and considering a pulmonary toilet. Leukocytosis is being monitored, and antibiotics have been started. Agitation is being managed with haloperidol, and tachycardia is being treated with IV fluids and sinus tachycardia is being monitored. Esophageal cancer treatment includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Nausea/vomiting"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and emergency bronchoscopy. She was transferred to another hospital for chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Upon transfer to the ICU, she is experiencing episodes of nausea/vomiting, pain, tachycardia, delirium, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 160/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. She is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, hydromorphone, haloperidol, and methadone. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. The plan includes managing respiratory distress with nebulizers and pulmonary toilet, controlling pain with different medications, addressing delirium, and monitoring tachycardia. The patient is also being treated for leukocytosis and esophageal cancer. She will be transferred to the floors for chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and hypoxia indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support with nebulizers and pulmonary toilet are necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocyt"
