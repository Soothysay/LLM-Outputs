","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and right cecal mass status post right colectomy. She presented post-operatively with fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. An abscess at the anastomosis site and right pleural effusion were found. She underwent thoracentesis and interventional radiology-guided placement of posterior drains. She also has a diverting loop ostomy and surgical drain placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient has an abdominal abscess which requires ongoing monitoring and management with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If the abscess does not improve or worsens, further intervention such as surgical exploration may be necessary.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of pulmonary edema and recurrent pleural effusion. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the pleural effusion. Repeat thoracentesis might be required if respiratory symptoms persist after extubation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased significantly, indicating possible acute renal failure. This could be due to contrast nephropathy or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring urine output, electrolytes, and adjusting medications accordingly are essential.
4. Type II diabetes: The patient has uncomplicated Type II diabetes, and insulin sliding scale management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a right cecal mass status post right colectomy. She presented post-operation with fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath, and was found to have an abscess at the anastomosis site and right pleural effusion. She underwent thoracentesis and interventional radiology (IR)-guided placement of two posterior drains. However, she still has persistent leukocytosis, and now has a post-operative diverting loop ostomy and surgical drain placement.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains sedated with propofol. She is being given broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Pip-tazo), with plans to hold Vancomycin due to supratherapeutic trough levels. She is also receiving IV Dilaudid for pain control and TPN for nutrition.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including an abdominal abscess, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, right pleural effusion, cecal mass, and type II diabetes. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the abdominal abscess, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function, reaccumulation of the right pleural effusion, recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and poorly controlled diabetes.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right colectomy and is now presenting post-operative with fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. The patient has an abscess at the anastomosis site and a right pleural effusion, for which she underwent thoracentesis and IR-guided placement of posterior drains. She also has a diverting loop ostomy and surgical drain placement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 116/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated with propofol and on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 42.2 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia. The patient's Hct levels are decreasing, indicating possible blood loss or ongoing bleeding.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes, acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), cecal mass pathology pending, and a history of AML treated in 2171 with subsequent treatment by Heme/Onc.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has been diagnosed with a cecal mass, which was determined to be lymphoid in nature. The patient has undergone several medical interventions including being placed on mechanical ventilation, having an NG tube inserted, and receiving multiple doses of antibiotics.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but there are fluctuations throughout the day. The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable with some variations, and the heart rate is within normal limits. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated, but the patient is maintaining adequate oxygenation with a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's renal function seems to be compromised, as indicated by the likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and elevated creatinine levels. There are also signs of fluid overload with an imbalance in fluid intake and output.

The patient has received several blood products, including a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been monitored and show a decreasing trend.

Regarding the lab results, the patient has elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly low platelet (Plt) count, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated bilirubin levels. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, and electrolyte levels such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl"

   Complicated case with hx of AML, MDS, now cecal mass resected (lymphoid
   tissue, no malignancy per prelim report) with post-op course
   complicated by hypotension, likely hypovolemic, acute renal failure,
   exudative pleural effusion (LDH 1154, no organisms, cytology neg), and
   acute resp failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment and right cecal mass resection. She presented postoperatively with fever, shortness of breath, and leukocytosis. A CT abdomen showed air around the anastomosis and a right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed, which revealed an exudate without any organisms or malignant cells.

The patient's operative course was complicated by hypotension, likely due to hypovolemia, acute renal failure, exudative pleural effusion, and acute respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving IV fluids with improved urine output.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient remains vent-dependent and may require repeat thoracentesis. There is a possibility of extubation within the next 24 hours.

2. Cardiovascular issues: An echocardiogram is pending to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient is suspected to have contrast-induced renal failure. Renal services have been consulted, and efforts will be made to diurese gently while aiming for a negative fluid balance.

4. Infectious disease etiology: The lymphoid mass in the cecal region suggests a systemic infection. Infection disease (ID) consultation has been requested to investigate further.

5. Nutrition: The patient is currently"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yr old woman with hx of AML tx with chemo [**2173**], right cecal mass
   resected [**2177-9-5**]. Postop presented with fever, SOB, leukocytosis. CT
   abd showed air around anastomosis and a right pleural effusion.
   Thoracentesis c/w exudate, cultures negative. Wbc progressively
   increased. Yesterday had diverting loop enterostomy with drain inserted
   at site of anastomosis. Operative course with low u/o. Postop
   hypotension, administered LR and transfused 2 u prbc, ffp. Transferred
   intubated, on vanco/zosyn/fluconazole. Currently responding to IV
   crystaloid with improved u/o.
   Complicated case with hx of AML, MDS, now cecal mass resected (path
   pending) with post-op course complicated by hypotension, likely
   hypovolemic, acute renal failure, exudative pleural effusion (LDH 1154,
   no organisms, cytology neg), and acute resp failure.
   Acute respiratory failure
 remains vent dependent, will check SBT
   today, will likely need therapeutic thoracentesis, possible extubation
   next 1-2 days.
   CVS - echo pending
   Acute renal failure - felt to be contrast-induced, renal service
   consulted, urine output improving, will diurese and aim for negative
   fluid balance
   ID - redose vanco by level, keep 15-20, continue Zosyn.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment and right cecal mass resection. She presented postoperatively with fever, shortness of breath, and leukocytosis. A CT scan of the abdomen showed air around the anastomosis and a right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed, confirming an exudate, with negative cultures. The patient's white blood cell count continued to increase.

The patient underwent a diverting loop enterostomy with surgical drain insertion at the site of anastomosis. She experienced postoperative hypotension and received intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. She was intubated and placed on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluconazole. Currently, the patient is responding to intravenous crystalloid with improved urine output.

The patient's medical history includes AML treatment, MDS, and resection of a cecal mass. The postoperative course has been complicated by hypotension, likely hypovolemic, acute renal failure, exudative pleural effusion, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, central venous catheter, and mechanical ventilation. Regular monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures,"

   # Abdominal abscess/post-op: Patient on mechanical ventilation post op
   with stable BP without the need for pressors. Pt remains sedated with
   propofol.  Pt with cont leukocytosis likely [**1-4**] intra-abdominal
   abscess, on broad spectrum abx. Initial path report shows lymphoid
   tissue, not malignant tissue. Further stains pending.
   - Continue to bolus prn low uop (UOP >30cc/hr) or hypotension (MAP >65)
   - Pain control with IV Dilaudid
   - Continue broad spectrum abx - Vanc/Pip-tazo.
     - Hold vancomycin due to elevated trough. Will redose according to
   worsening renal function
   - Monitor drain output
   - Follow-up blood and fluid cultures
 currently no growth to date
   - Consult ID regarding possible infectious etiology for cecal mass

   # Respiratory: Patient intubated on transfer. Patient is comfortable on
   PS 10/5 this AM.  CXR show unchanged to slightly improved right pleural
   effusion and pulmonary edema.  Pt fluid overloaded.
   - SBT this morning, followed by possible thoracentesis.
   - Attempt to wean if possible, but could be limited by effusion
   - Gentle diuresis of 0.5-1 Liter. Check daily weights.

   # R pleural effusion: Thoracentesis shortly after admission. Exudative.
   No evidence of infection or malignant cells, however appears to have
   reaccumulated. [**Month (only) 8**] require repeat thoracentesis if respiratory symptoms

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right colectomy for a cecal mass. She presented post-op with fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. Further evaluation revealed an abscess at the anastomosis site and right pleural effusion. She underwent thoracentesis and placement of posterior drains. The patient also has acute renal failure likely due to contrast nephropathy/acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her cecal mass pathology is still pending. She has a known diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and type II diabetes. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient has leukocytosis and an abscess at the anastomosis site. This indicates a potential ongoing infection that may require further intervention.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. She has a right pleural effusion which may need to be managed through thoracentesis or other interventions.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a rising creatinine level and evidence of contrast nephropathy/ATN. This suggests impaired renal function that may require dialysis or other renal supportive measures.
4. Infection: Given the presence of fever and leukocytosis,"

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML with
   cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastamosis site leakage
   and abscess formation and right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and
   IR guided drain placement x2 admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op fever,
   leukocytosis, and SOB now post-op from diverting loop ostomy and
   surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal fluid collection s/p ex-lap: Patient afebrile over last 24
   hours with WBC trending down to 36. Patient is s/p IR guided drain
   placement x2 and surgical drain placement x1.
   - Monitor drain output
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
   - Vanco level today 24.5. Hold dose today, recheck tomorrow and dose
   when level <15.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Monitor UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient extubated succesfully yesterday. Now off
   supplemental oxygen. Continues to have large right-sided pleural
   effusion s/p thoracentesis consistent with exudative process with
   culture and cytology negative.
   - If resp status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine stable today at 2.9.  Evaluated by
   renal who feel that ARF likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and
   ATN rather than CIN.
   - Monitor creatinine, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Avoid diuresis
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cecal mass: Verbal report as lymphoid tissue with final report
   pending.  ID consult yesterday with differential including TB,
   actinomyces, E. histolytica, and Yersenia.  Patient has had negative
   stool O+P x3 and C.diff x3.
   - Stool yersenia
   - Serology for E. histolytica.
   - Discuss with pathology - add AFB, gram stain for actinomyces and
   Yersenia.
   - Follow-up final path report.
   .
   # AML/MDS: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear did not
   demonstrate blasts and consistent with prior diagnosis of MDS.
   Leukocytosis also likely secondary to infection in post-operative
   setting.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history significant for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a cecal mass that underwent hemicolectomy. She presented with post-operative fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. She also has a right pleural effusion, abdominal fluid collection, and acute renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Assessment and plan:
1. Abdominal fluid collection: Monitor drain output, continue broad antibiotic coverage, follow-up cultures, monitor urine output (UOP), mentation, mean arterial pressures (MAPs), central venous pressure (CVP), and provide bolus intravenous fluids as necessary.
2. Respiratory: Patient successfully extubated yesterday and now off supplemental oxygen. Continues to have a large right-sided pleural effusion. If respiratory status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis.
3. Acute renal failure: Creatinine stable today at 2.9. Evaluate by renal team who feel that acute renal failure is likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) rather than contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Monitor creatinine, electrolytes, UOP, avoid diuresis, renally dose medications, and avoid nephrotoxins.
4. Cecal mass: Verbal report indicates lymphoid tissue with final report pending. ID consult yesterday with a differential including tuberculosis, act"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a cecal mass who underwent hemicolectomy. She is currently admitted to the ICU for post-operative fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. The patient has complications including anastomosis site leakage, abscess formation, right pleural effusion, abdominal fluid collection, and acute renal failure. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and various tests and consultations are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation: The patient has a history of anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation following her hemicolectomy. These complications can lead to infection, sepsis, and further respiratory distress.
2. Right pleural effusion: The patient has a large right-sided pleural effusion, which can compromise respiratory function and increase the risk of respiratory infection.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to intraoperative fluid shifts and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This condition requires careful monitoring of kidney function and management of fluid balance.
4. Type II diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes, which needs to be managed with insulin in total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
5. FEN (feeding): The patient is on nothing by mouth (NPO) status and receiving TPN. Nutritional support is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML with
   cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastamosis site leakage
   and abscess formation and right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and
   IR guided drain placement x2 admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op fever,
   leukocytosis, and SOB now post-op from diverting loop ostomy and
   surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal fluid collection s/p ex-lap: Patient afebrile over last 24
   hours with WBC trending down to 36. Patient is s/p IR guided drain
   placement x2 and surgical drain placement x1.
   - Monitor drain output
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
   - Vanco level today 24.5. Hold dose today, recheck tomorrow and dose
   when level <15.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Monitor UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient extubated succesfully yesterday. Now off
   supplemental oxygen. Continues to have large right-sided pleural
   effusion s/p thoracentesis consistent with exudative process with
   culture and cytology negative.
   - If resp status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine stable today at 2.9.  Evaluated by
   renal who feel that ARF likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and
   ATN rather than CIN.
   - Monitor creatinine, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Avoid diuresis
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cecal mass: Verbal report as lymphoid tissue with final report
   pending.  ID consult yesterday with differential including TB,
   actinomyces, E. histolytica, and Yersenia.  Patient has had negative
   stool O+P x3 and C.diff x3.
   - Stool yersenia
   - Serology for E. histolytica.
   - Discuss with pathology - add AFB, gram stain for actinomyces and
   Yersenia.
   - Follow-up final path report.
   .
   # AML/MDS: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear did not
   demonstrate blasts and consistent with prior diagnosis of MDS.
   Leukocytosis also likely secondary to infection in post-operative
   setting.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs
   .
   # Type II Diabetes:
   - ISS, insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN: NPO, TPN. Replete as necessary. NGT to intermittent suction
   .
   # Access: PICC RAC, PIV LAC, R radial arterial line

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history significant for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a cecal mass post hemicolectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for post-operative fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. She underwent a diverting loop ostomy and surgical drain placement. The patient is currently afebrile with a decreasing white blood cell count. She has an abdominal fluid collection that required IR-guided drain placement, a right pleural effusion that was thoracentesis, and acute renal failure with stable creatinine levels. She is extubated and no longer requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and she is being treated for various complications including infection, AML/MDS, type II diabetes, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to AML treatment and surgery, increasing the risk of infection. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential bacterial pathogens.
2. Abscess formation: The patient had an abscess in the past, which required drainage. There is a possibility of recurrence or new abscess formation.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large right-sided pleural effusion, which may need further evaluation and management. It could be due to infection or malignancy.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML with
   cecal mass s/p hemicolectomy complicated by anastamosis site leakage
   and abscess formation and right pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and
   IR guided drain placement x2 admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op fever,
   leukocytosis, and SOB now post-op from diverting loop ostomy and
   surgical drain placement.
   .
   # Abdominal fluid collection s/p ex-lap: Patient afebrile over last 24
   hours with WBC trending down to 36. Patient is s/p IR guided drain
   placement x2 and surgical drain placement x1.
   - Monitor drain output
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with renally dosed pip/tazo
   - Vanco level today 24.5. Hold dose today, recheck tomorrow and dose
   when level <15.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Monitor UOP, mentation, MAPs, CVP and bolus IVF as necessary
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient extubated succesfully yesterday. Now off
   supplemental oxygen. Continues to have large right-sided pleural
   effusion s/p thoracentesis consistent with exudative process with
   culture and cytology negative.  TTE ordered from last week to assess LV
   function pre-extubation performed this AM.
   - If respiratory status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis.
   - Follow-up TTE results.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine stable today at 2.9.  Evaluated by
   renal who feel that ARF likely due to intraoperative fluid shifts and
   ATN rather than CIN.
   - Monitor creatinine, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Avoid diuresis
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cecal mass: Verbal report as lymphoid tissue with final report
   pending.  ID consult yesterday with differential including TB,
   actinomyces, E. histolytica, and Yersenia.  Patient has had negative
   stool O+P x3 and C.diff x3.
   - Stool yersenia
   - Serology for E. histolytica.
   - Discuss with pathology - add AFB, gram stain for actinomyces and
   Yersenia.
   - Follow-up final path report.
   .
   # AML/MDS: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc this admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear did not
   demonstrate blasts and consistent with prior diagnosis of MDS.
   Leukocytosis also likely secondary to infection in post-operative
   setting.
   - Recommend transfuse HCT <25
   - Follow-up onc recs if any
   .
   # Type II Diabetes:
   - ISS, insulin in TPN
   .
   # FEN: NPO, TPN. Replete as necessary. NGT to intermittent suction
   .
   # Access: PICC RAC, PIV LAC, R radial arterial line
   .
   # PPx: heparin SQ and PPI
   .
   # Code: Full, confirmed with husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1904**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1907**], ICU
   .
   # Dispo: Can likely call out this afternoon to East [**Doctor First Name **].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a hemicolectomy due to a cecal mass. Postoperatively, the patient developed anastomosis site leakage and abscess formation, as well as a right pleural effusion. She was admitted to the ICU for postoperative fever, leukocytosis, and shortness of breath. The patient recently underwent a diverting loop ostomy and surgical drain placement.

Current Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal fluid collection: The patient is afebrile, with a decreasing white blood cell count. She has had two interventional radiology (IR) guided drain placements and one surgical drain placement. Monitor drain output, continue broad antibiotic coverage, follow-up cultures, monitor urine output (UOP), mental status, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and provide IV fluids as needed.
2. Respiratory: The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is no longer on supplemental oxygen. She still has a large right-sided pleural effusion consistent with an exudative process, with negative cultures and cytology. An echocardiogram (TTE) is ordered to assess left ventricular function pre-extubation, performed this morning. If respiratory status declines, consider repeat thoracentesis. Follow-up TTE results.
3. Acute renal failure: Creatinine is stable"
