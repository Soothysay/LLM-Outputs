","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis. The patient is mildly hypothermic, tachycardia, and has an elevated white blood cell count. The likely source of sepsis is urosepsis, possibly due to a urinary tract infection. Other potential sources include ulcers, the hemodialysis line, or endovascular infection. The patient is also experiencing impaired skin integrity with significant stage 4 decubitus ulcers on the sacrum and ischial spines. The patient has several comorbidities including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and other medications to manage her conditions. She is being weaned off the pressor agent Levophed and her blood cultures are being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of stage 4 decubitus ulcers increases the risk of infection, especially in an immunocompromised patient like this one.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may worsen if sepsis progresses or if there are complications in managing her other medical conditions.
4. Renal Failure: Given the patient's history of ESRD, there is a risk of renal failure due to inadequate dialysis, infection, or medication-related nephrotoxicity.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and CHF increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure exacerbation.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of LGIB puts her at risk for recurrent bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and anemia.
7. Wound Infection: The patient's decubitus ulcers are at high risk for infection, which can further complicate her clinical picture.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism: Immobilization and compromised venous return due to impaired skin integrity increase the risk of developing blood clots.
9. Malnutrition: Prolonged ICU stay and impaired nutritional intake may lead to malnutrition, delaying recovery and increasing the risk of infections.
10. Psychological Distress: The patient's history of depression and chronic illnesses may contribute to psychological distress, impacting her overall well-being and recovery.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a chronically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The note details the patient's current condition and ongoing management in the ICU. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous NSTEMI, congestive heart failure (CHF), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pressure ulcers. 

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis or hypovolemia. There is a high suspicion of a urinary tract infection as the source of infection, given the recent growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the urine. Other possible sources of infection include ulcers, the hemodialysis line, or endovascular issues. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and will continue fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support to maintain a systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 90.

The patient's blood work indicates an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection. Other lab results show abnormalities in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus levels. The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be related to chronic kidney disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension - Likely sepsis, although hypovolemia likely contributing
   as completed HD today. Patient with a WBC >12,000, does not strictly
   meet SIRS but tachycardia may be masked by beta-blocker; urine is the
   likely source (recent VRE and MSSA). Other possibilities include ulcers
   (previously grew MRSA), HD line, or endovascular. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on
   CXR. Pt currently has a central line with vasopressor support. Will
   continue fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support for a SBP >90.
   Pt's BP currently noted to be SBP 110s after 2L NS in the ED, on
   Levophed at 0.09. Will down-titrate Levophed and will hold pt's current
   hypertensive regimen until resolved.
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain SBP>90
   - Continue broad spectrum antiobiotics with dapto and zosyn
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx and stool C. Diff
   - Attempt to send cultures from HD line, discuss with renal
   - Renal U/S to r/o abscess
   - Wound care consult
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   .
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Notify renal of pt admission, may require CVVHD should continue to
   need vasopressors
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   .
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   .
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   .
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria. Active T&S. Hct daily.
   .
   # DM: Will cotninue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   .
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notify her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, the note mentions a 24-hour event related to multi-lumen central venous catheter insertion on [**2146-2-7**] at 08:27 PM. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including norepinephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam, daptomycin, and metronidazole. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5%), heart rate of 70 bpm (68-79), blood pressure of 89/30 mmHg (45) with fluctuations, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (11-21), and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. 

The patient is hemodynamically unstable with low blood pressure, requiring vasopressor support. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears chronically ill but is not in acute distress. There are no abnormal findings in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, but diminished breath sounds are noted at the lung bases bilaterally. 

Abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient has a well-healed midline scar and firmness in the right lower quadrant. 

Neurological examination is not fully assessed due to the patient's current condition. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell"

   Septic shock:     likely from UTI which was not treated for
   specifically (VRE), also consider HD line, decubes, C.diff as sources.
                            -   Continue broad sprectrum coverage, follow
   up on cultures
                            -   Worsening CXR, so doubt that she is
   hypovolemic, so would not give her IVF any more.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, systolic congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease with left below-knee amputation, coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus type II, previous lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and stage IV decubitus ulcer. She presented with hypotension after hemodialysis and was diagnosed with septic shock likely caused by an untreated urinary tract infection (VRE). Other potential sources of infection include her hemodialysis line, decubitus ulcers, and Clostridium difficile.

The patient received levophed with improvement and was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam in the emergency department. In the MICU, she was given more intravenous fluids with no response and then switched to daptomycin and Flagyl for possible C. difficile.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/37 mmHg to 133/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient has crackles bilaterally with bronchial breath sounds on the left base. She has a sacral decubitus ulcer (stage IV) and warm skin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with left below-knee amputation (BKA), coronary artery disease (CAD) with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), prior lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and stage IV decubitus ulcer. She presented with hypotension after HD and was diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to an untreated urinary tract infection (UTI) or other sources such as the hemodialysis line, decubitus ulcers, or Clostridium difficile infection. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics but showed no improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued septic shock due to inadequate source control or resistant infection.
2. Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state due to uncontrolled diabetes.
4. Complications from the decubitus ulcer, such as infection or worsening of the ulcer itself.
5. C. difficile infection leading to colitis or toxic megacolon.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia due to her pre-existing CAD and CHF.
7. Renal failure or worsening of ESRD due to the"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Pending HD today
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].

The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis, and has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypotension: Secondary to sepsis, likely C. diff. The patient's WBC count is trending down, and she remains afebrile. Possible other sources of infection include urosepsis, posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based on symptoms, although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable infiltrate/effusion of L side.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to bacteremia with resistant organisms. The patient has a history of chronic renal disease and is currently on dialysis. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

24-hour events:
- Blood cultures were obtained from both femoral lines and the hemodialysis (HD) line.
- An arterial line was started, and a dialysis catheter was placed.
- An ultrasound was performed, revealing a hypertensive right atrial line that was turned off temporarily. The patient complained of armpit pain but showed no signs of thrombosis. X-rays showed spurring of the right acromioclavicular joint, no fractures or osteoarthritis, and small bilateral kidneys with cortical thinning consistent with chronic kidney disease. No perinephric fluid collections were found.
- The patient had episodes of ventricular tachycardia overnight and is now more somnolent with an ABG indicating acidosis. No changes were noted on the EKG.
- The patient complains of back and bottom pain but denies difficulty breathing.
- Allergies include iodine-containing agents, but the specific classification is unknown.
- Antibiotics administered include piperacillin/tazobactam, daptomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue broad spectrum antiobiotics with dapto, zosyn and flagyl,
   added PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Attempt to send cultures from HD line, discuss with renal
   - Wound care consult, consider X-rays to rule out osteomyelitis, ESR no
   utility in chronic inflammatory states
   - Vascular surgery to evaluate heel ulcer today
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Pending HD today
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis. She has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient remains hypotensive and has a low blood count, indicating ongoing infection. Possible sources of infection include urosepsis, posterior ulcer, hemodialysis line, or endovascular source. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin orally, and her blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent for follow-up. She is also scheduled for wound care consult and vascular surgery evaluation for her heel ulcer. The patient's conditions include end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She is being managed with multiple medications and has a decubitus ulcer. The patient's family has been notified of her admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and low blood count suggest ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. C. diff infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. It is important to continue treatment with vancomycin and monitor for any worsening symptoms.
3. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a significant stage 4 dec"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with septicemia due to C. diff, currently in septic shock. She is somnolent with an elevated pCO2 level. She has experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia. The patient has a history of multiple allergies, including iodine-containing agents. She received various antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, daptomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. She is being infused with norepinephrine and other ICU medications. Her vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, low respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance and fluid input/output. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has an ABG result indicating respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and diminished peripheral pulses. The patient is alert, oriented, and follows commands, but unable to stand due to musculoskeletal issues. Neurologic examination is incomplete. Lab results show anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and low albumin levels. The patient's ESRD requires consideration for hemodialysis despite challenges related to her use of levophed. She also has hypoxemia and hypercarbia, which may be due to fluid overload or chronic respiratory failure. The patient's ICU care plan includes managing septic"

   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Pending HD today
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: R femoral CVL, PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line
   # PPx: p-boots, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  FULL (confirmed) Will address intubation again today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems. She was admitted for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis, and is now known to have Clostridium difficile (C. Diff). The patient also has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and diabetes mellitus (DM). Additionally, she has a decubitus ulcer and depression.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 104/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles above the bases of the lungs, diminished sounds bilaterally, and a significant stage 4 decubitus ulcer on the sacrum. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension: Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff. WBC count is trending down today and the patient remains afebrile. Possible other sources include urosepsis, posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based on symptoms although"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia this morning which have improved
   (but not resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending down today and patient remains afebrile. Possible other
   sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD
   line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion for pulmonary source based
   on symptoms although possible R infiltrate on CXR and questionable
   infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   -Check arterial line to ensure pressor requirement is accurate
   - If persistently hypotensive, will reinitiate Dapto/Zosyn
   -Check lactate and mixed venous O2 today
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes.  During
   pre-rounds her mental status cleared to baseline but hypercarbia only
   improved with decrease oxygenation.
   -          Tolerate hypercarbia if patient comfortable and mentating
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Clarify code status/intubation status
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - HD pending pressor requirement, will discuss need for HD with renal,
   as patient may be intravascularly dry but total volume up.
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal consulted
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line, PICC
   # PPx: p-boots, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  Currently DNR/DNI- will likely progress to no escalation of
   care pending family talk today

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with septicemia caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). She has been evaluated by a plastic surgeon who believes she has stage IV decubitus ulcers requiring debridement. The patient has expressed her wish to be DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and DNI (Do Not Intubate). 

The patient's medical history includes a recent infection, decubitus ulcers, and renal failure. She is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, daptomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. She is also on levophed for blood pressure support, remeron for anxiety, vancomycin orally, and other medications such as tylenol, lipitor, protonix, renal, and nephrocaps.

The patient's vital signs show a low body temperature (Tmax: 35.6°C), low blood pressure (BP: 106/47 mmHg), normal heart rate (HR: 82 bpm), normal respiratory rate (RR: 15 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. She is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing a pH of 7.25.

Physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, and peripheral pulses ranging from 3+ on the right leg to 3"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia which have improved (but not
   resolved).
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending back up today, the patient remains afebrile, but at times
   hypothermic. Possible other sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and
   MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion
   for pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate
   on CXR and questionable infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to continue to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive
   regimen until resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx, no growth to date
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   - Consider adding back Dapto/Zosyn today as persistently hypotensive
   and continues to require pressors
   - lactate and mixed venous O2 yesterday were within normal limits
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes, now on
   two occasions.   The most recent was overnight last night she became
   less responsive and found to have acidosis, hypercarbia.  Seemed to
   clear on its own with arousal, with improvement of her ABG.  Likely

   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Renal function worsening, patient will likely need HD today, but
   continues to require pressors.
   - Continue phos binders

   - Renal on board
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis.
- She has known Clostridium difficile (C. Diff.) and was found with decreased alertness and hypercapnia, which have improved but not resolved.
- Possible sources of infection include urosepsis, recent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections, posterior ulcer, hemodialysis (HD) line, or endovascular source.
- The patient remains afebrile but at times hypothermic.
- Her white blood cell count is trending back up.
- She has a history of chronic kidney disease and is usually on HD three times a week.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- She also has congestive heart failure (CHF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%.
- The patient has experienced lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) of unknown source and has significant diverticuli on CT abdomen.
- She has diabetes mellitus (DM) and is on home regimens of insulin secretagogues and long-acting insulin.
- The patient has a stage 4 decubitus ulcer and has been referred to wound care.
- She has depression and is on remeron and celexa.
- The patient's sodium levels are low, and she requires dietary restrictions and supplementation.
- She has multiple lines and catheters in place, including a peripheral IV line, right subclavian tunneled HD line, and PICC line.
- The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI).
- Her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension secondary to sepsis: The patient's hypotension could worsen if the underlying infection is not effectively managed.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The patient's hypercapnia could recur, leading to further respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, requiring more frequent hemodialysis or potentially renal replacement therapy.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's CAD could progress, leading to further cardiac complications.
5. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's CHF could worsen, resulting in fluid overload and respiratory distress.
6. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB): The patient may experience recurrent LGIB, which can lead to significant blood loss and anemia.
7. Decubitus ulcer: The patient's stage 4 decubitus ulcer could worsen, increasing the risk of infection and poor wound healing.

She has been found with decreased alertness and hypercapnia, which have improved but not resolved. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory distress, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 103/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and a temperature of 36.3 C. The patient is also experiencing a mixed venous O2 saturation of 74%, indicating inadequate tissue oxygenation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's glucose level is within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis, possibly due to C. Diff. The WBC count is trending down, and the patient remains afebrile. Possible other sources include urosepsis, VRE and MSSA infection, posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Attempt to continue"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending back up today, the patient remains afebrile, but at times
   hypothermic. Possible other sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and
   MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion
   for pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate
   on CXR and questionable infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive regimen until
   resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin, add back zosyn and daptomycin as
   the patient continues to be hypotensive with a pressor requirement.
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx, no growth to date
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   - lactate and mixed venous O2 yesterday were within normal limits
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes, now on
   two occasions.   The most recent was overnight last night she became
   less responsive and found to have acidosis, hypercarbia.  Seemed to
   clear on its own with arousal, with improvement of her ABG.
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Pt is DNR/DNI
   -          HD vs CVVH today for volume removal and acidosis treatment
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Renal function worsening, patient will likely need HD today, but
   continues to require pressors thus may need CVVH
   - Will give 150mEq of Bicarb for acidosis treatment
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal on board
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K yesterday
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].  Vascular recommended accuzyme to the
   right heel and right ischial spine ulcers.
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line, PICC

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems, was admitted for hypotension likely secondary to sepsis caused by Clostridium difficile (C. Diff). The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is usually on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. She also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and diabetes mellitus (DM).

Upon admission, the patient presented with decreased alertness and hypercapnia. The vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. The physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, diminished sounds bilaterally, and a significant stage 4 decubitus ulcer on the sacrum. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive and requires pressor support. Possible sources of infection include C. Diff, urosepsis, posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. The patient will continue IV flagyl and PO vancomycin, and other antibiotics will be added as necessary.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes. She will be closely monitored with repeated arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and generalized weakness. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. 

24-hour events include the patient becoming unresponsive in the morning, with an arterial blood gas showing hypercapnia and acidosis. This was likely due to uremia and necessitated hemodialysis. The patient also had runs of ventricular bigeminy, which is likely from uremia as well.

The patient has allergies to iodine-containing agents and has received vancomycin and metronidazole in the past.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/42 to 132/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has a first-degree AV block.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, with decreased sodium, potassium, calcium, and albumin levels. Other lab values include elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels, with decreased total CO2 and glucose levels. Coagulation studies reveal prolonged PT and PTT with normal INR.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems admitted to the ICU for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis. She has known C. Diff and was found with decreased alertness and hypercapnia. The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) by her family and is currently on a fentanyl drip. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and presence of C. Diff suggest the possibility of sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results show a low pH (7.15) indicating acidosis, which may be due to respiratory failure. This could be caused by her decreased alertness and inability to maintain adequate ventilation.

3. Stage 4 Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a significant stage 4 decubitus ulcer on her sacrum and bilateral ischial spines. This is a serious complication of prolonged immobility and can lead to deep tissue damage and infection.

4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels (3.1, 3.5, 3.9) indicate possible renal dysfunction. This could be due to sepsis, dehydration, or other underlying kidney diseases.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension,
   likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff.  She was found with
   decreased alertness and hypercapnia.
   Patient has been made CMO by her family.  She is currently made
   comfortable on a fentanyl drip.
   # Hypotension
 Secondary to sepsis, likely C. Diff.  WBC count is
   trending back up today, the patient remains afebrile, but at times
   hypothermic. Possible other sources include urosepsis, (recent VRE and
   MSSA), posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. Low suspicion
   for pulmonary source based on symptoms although possible R infiltrate
   on CXR and questionable infiltrate/effusion of L side.
   - Attempt to wean Levophed, continue to hold hypertensive regimen until
   resolved.
   - Continue IV flagyl & PO Vancomycin, add back zosyn and daptomycin as
   the patient continues to be hypotensive with a pressor requirement.
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures; check sputum cx, no growth to date
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve-slightly increased WBC and hypothermic,
   concerning for possible continued infection though no other sites
   identified
   - No active signs ischemia so maintain Hct>25, however given history if
   develops ischemic symptoms would transfuse for Hct>30
   - lactate and mixed venous O2 yesterday were within normal limits
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed
   respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes, now on
   two occasions.   The most recent was overnight last night she became
   less responsive and found to have acidosis, hypercarbia.  Seemed to
   clear on its own with arousal, with improvement of her ABG.
   -          Follow ABG with status changes
   -          Pt is DNR/DNI
   -          HD vs CVVH today for volume removal and acidosis treatment
   # ESRD: Pt usually on HD and is run Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   - Renal function worsening, patient will likely need HD today, but
   continues to require pressors thus may need CVVH
   - Will give 150mEq of Bicarb for acidosis treatment
   - Continue phos binders
   - Renally dose medications
   - Renal on board
   # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ([**4-27**]). No current signs ischemia. Continue medical
   management with statin but hold beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   and continue to hold ASA given multiple recent recurrent LGIB.
   # CHF: Systolic (EF 45%), presumably due to ischemia. Holding
   beta-blocker and lisinopril until hypotension resolves. Low Na diet,
   daily weights, I/Os.
   # LGIB: Unknown source as unable to tolerate colonoscopy, but CT abd
   shows significant diverticuli. Hct at baseline ~28-30, transfuse per
   above criteria.
   -          Active T&S
   -          Daily Hct
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          5 mg PO vitamin K yesterday
   # DM: Will continue pt on home regimen of ISS and Lantus.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Wound Care consult. Notified her vascular surgeon
   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] of admission as had been scheduled for routine f/u eval of
   right heel ulcer on [**2146-2-8**].  Vascular recommended accuzyme to the
   right heel and right ischial spine ulcers.
   # Depression: Continue remeron and celexa.
   # FEN: low Na/cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV, R subclav tunneled HD line, PICC
   # PPx: p-boots, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code:  CMO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical problems admitted for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis now with known C. Diff. She was found with decreased alertness and hypercapnia. The patient has been made comfort-measured (CMO) by her family and is currently on a fentanyl drip. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive and is on a pressor requirement. Possible sources of hypotension include sepsis, urosepsis, posterior ulcer, HD line, or endovascular source. 
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient developed mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with mental status changes. She is being closely monitored with ABG and will continue to be followed for any status changes.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's renal function is worsening, and she will likely need hemodialysis (HD) today. However, she continues to require pressors, so continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) may also be needed.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the past. No current signs of ischemia are present, but medical management with a statin is ongoing.
5. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has systolic heart failure with an ejection"
