","Summary:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation.
- He presented with hypoglycemia and altered mental status.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedated with propofol.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 90/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated troponin T levels, hypercarbic respiratory distress, hypernatremia, and other abnormalities.
- The patient's sputum culture is positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs.
- The assessment and plan include weaning off propofol, continuing mechanical ventilation, and attempting to wean when mental status improves.
- Other plans include ruling out infection, monitoring fluid status, holding on sedating medications, and monitoring for fever and WBC count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's sputum culture is positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. This could lead to pneumonia or another respiratory infection.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis, likely secondary to hypoventilation. This can be a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation (afib). He was admitted to the ICU with hypoglycemia and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and rapid respiratory rate. His laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hypercarbic respiratory distress, and hypernatremia. The patient's sputum culture grew gram-positive cocci (GPC), and a CT scan showed patchy airspace disease in the lung apices. The patient's urine output has been decreasing, and he has positive urine toxicology for opioids.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory acidosis likely due to hypoventilation caused by altered mental status. Mechanical ventilation will be continued, and weaning will be attempted when mental status improves.

2. Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the altered mental status is unclear. It may be secondary to hypoglycemia, opiates, or other factors. Propofol sedation will be weaned to assess mental status improvement. RSBI and SBT will be performed in the morning if mental status improves.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient is afebrile but has a high white blood cell count. He"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently in the ICU for hypoglycemia and altered mental status. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 90/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood glucose level has been controlled to high since admission. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low sodium level, and normal potassium and chloride levels. The patient's urine is positive for opioids, and he has a history of using morphine and penicillins. Imaging shows ill-defined patchy airspace disease at the lung apices, which could represent inflammation or atypical infection. Sputum culture is growing Gram-positive cocci (GPC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's ABG indicates respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation, likely secondary to altered mental status. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilation"

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and positive sputum culture for gram-positive cocci (GPC), indicating a possible infection. This could be related to pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
3. Cardiac Complications: The presence of ST depression on EKG suggests possible cardiac ischemia or infarction. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to rule out any cardiac complications.
4. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, indicating an imbalance in sodium levels. Ongoing monitoring and correction of electrolytes are required.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, hypercarbic respiratory distress, and pneumonia.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The patient's ABG results show respiratory acidosis, likely due to hypoventilation caused by altered mental status. The patient's urine tested positive for opioids, and he was hypoglycemic. Since admission, the patient's glucose levels have been controlled to high. The patient's worsening consolidation on CXR indicates likely pneumonia. A CT scan showed ill-defined patchy airspace disease at the lung apices, which could represent inflammation or atypical infection. The patient's sputum is growing gram-positive cocci (GPC). 
   - Continue mechanical ventilation for now and attempt to wean tomorrow.
   - Treat GPC with levofloxacin and cover for MRSA given the patient's history of nursing home residence and frequent hospital admissions. Adjust antibiotics according to culture and sensitivities.

2. Altered mental status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status is unclear, but it may be secondary to hypoglycemia. Despite correcting the blood glucose levels, the patient's mental status did not improve. Opiate use and u"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient was admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental status. Upon admission, the patient's blood glucose was controlled to high levels. The patient's sputum tested positive for gram-positive cocci (GPC) and the CT scan showed patchy airspace disease at the lung apices, which could represent inflammation or atypical infection. The patient's chest X-ray showed worsening consolidation, indicating pneumonia. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated on admission.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) showed respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation, likely secondary to altered mental status.
2. Altered Mental Status: The cause of the altered mental status is unclear, but it may be related to hypoglycemia. The patient's glucose levels have been controlled to high since admission. The presence of opioids in the urine suggests possible opioid use, but the mental status did not improve with correction of blood glucose.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and consolidation on chest X-ray, consistent with pneumonia. Sputum culture showed growth of GPC, and a CT scan confirmed patchy airspace disease. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1219**] is a 73 year old female with a PMH significant for CAD, CM,
   COPD, DM, afib s/p pacer admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental
   status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Given altered mental status, leukocytosis, and
   CXR findings, this likely represents an aspiration versus atypical
   pneumonia.  ABG yesterday 7.32/55/145 on PS 10/5, 40%, increased to PS
   15/5, 40%.  RSBI this AM <100.  CXR demonstrates bilateral infiltrates
   (R>L) improved from yesterday.  Sputum culture demonstrated sparse
   growth after gram stain showed GPC in pairs.
   - RSBI<100, but patient did not tolerate PS 10/5.  Unlikely to be a
   succesfuly extubation so will wait and reevaluate tomorrow.
   - Continue levofloxacin, hold vancomycin
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   .
   # Pneumonia: Afebrile on presentation, but has since become febrile to
   102.2 with CT and CXR demonstrating bilateral consolidations. Sputum
   with GPC in pairs on gram stain but with OP growth on culture, unlikely
   to be MRSA.
   - Continue levofloxacin for pneumonia. Hold vancomycin.
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - monitor fever curve and wbc count.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 146 yesterday and received free water flushes with
   TF. Serum sodium WNL today.
   .
   # ST depression on EKG:  Admission ECG showed ST depression in II, III,
   avL, v3-v4.  Cards was consulted and recommended following CE.  Cardiac
   biomarkers x4 drawn with rise in troponin to 0.04 with flat CK likely
   representing demand ischemia.
   # DM: On NPH at home. FS in past 24 hours 145-222.
   - Continue ISS with accuchecks
   - As patient is on TF, restart NPH.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1219**] is a 73 year old female with a PMH significant for CAD, CM,
   COPD, DM, afib s/p pacer admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental
   status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Given altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, and CXR findings, this likely represents an aspiration
   versus atypical pneumonia.  ABG yesterday 7.32/55/145 on PS 10/5, 40%,
   increased to PS 15/5, 40%.  RSBI this AM <100.  CXR demonstrates
   bilateral infiltrates (R>L) improved from yesterday.  Sputum culture
   demonstrated sparse growth after gram stain showed GPC in pairs.
   - RSBI<100, SBT this AM and extubate if possible
   - Continue vancomycin and levofloxacin
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - Wean sedation as possible
   .
   # Pneumonia: Afebrile on presentation, but has since become febrile to
   102.2 with CT and CXR demonstrating bilateral consolidations. Sputum
   with GPC in pairs on gram stain but with OP growth on culture.
   - Continue levofloxacin and vanco for atypical versus aspiration
   pneumonia.
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - monitor fever curve and wbc count.
   - Send Legionella urinary antigen
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear etiology- may be secondary to
   hypoglycemia though MS did not improve with correction of blood glucose
   vs opiates and utox was positive. Likely secondary to pneumonia as
   stated above.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 146 yesterday.  Has been receiving 250cc free water
   flushes Q6H with TF.
   - Check serum chemistries this AM
   .
   # ST depression on EKG:  Admission ECG showed ST depression in II, III,
   avL, v3-v4.  Cards was consulted and recommended following CE.  Cardiac
   biomarkers x4 drawn with rise in troponin to 0.04 with flat CK likely
   representing demand ischemia.
   # DM: On NPH at home. FS in past 24 hours 145-222.
   - Continue ISS with accuchecks
   - As patient is on TF, restart NP (Insulin NPH 40U qAM, 25U qPM ).
   .
   # FEN: Continue TF. Patient will need speech and swallow eval when
   extuabed.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SC, bowel regimen

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1219**] is a 73 year old female with a PMH significant for CAD, CM,
   COPD, DM, afib s/p pacer admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental
   status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Given altered mental status, leukocytosis, and
   CXR findings, this likely represents an aspiration pneumonia.  RSBI
   this AM 88, patient unlikely to be successful intubation in setting of
   continued fevers and mental status.  CXR demonstrates bibasilar and RUL
   infiltrate unchanged from yesterday, although infiltrate at right base
   improved on CXR.  Repeat sputum gram stain negative.
   - Bronchoscopy today for RUL BAL sample.
   - Consider expanding antimicrobial coverage back to vancomycin and
   adequate gram negative coverage as patient has been febrile in spite of
   levofloxacin therapy.
   - Continue levofloxacin for now
   - Continue propafol, check amylase, lipase, and triglycerides
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient febrile overnight to 101.2.  Repeat sputum gram
   stain negative.
   - Bronchoscopy today
   - Continue levofloxacin, consider broadening coverage as above
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC count
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely secondary to hypoglycemia.  Patient
   becomes able to move extremities and is more alert when propafol turned
   off.

   # ST depression on EKG:  Admission ECG showed ST depression in II, III,
   avL, v3-v4.  Cards was consulted and recommended following CE.  Cardiac
   biomarkers x4 drawn with rise in troponin to 0.04 with flat CK likely
   representing demand ischemia.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation (afib) who was admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has respiratory failure, pneumonia, altered mental status, ST depression on EKG, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and is currently receiving ICU level care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress, difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation, and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is not improving despite antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of worsening infection, development of antibiotic resistance, or progression to necrotizing pneumonia.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to hypoglycemia. It is important to maintain appropriate blood glucose levels to prevent further neurological complications.

4. ST Depression on EKG: The presence of ST depression on the EKG suggests myocardial ischemia. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of ongoing ischemia or infarction, and cardiac biomarkers should be trended.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 26.8%. This condition"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint includes hypoglycemia, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker (afib s/p pacer). 

The patient was admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental status, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The respiratory failure is attributed to the altered mental status, leukocytosis, and findings on the chest X-ray (CXR). The CXR shows bilateral pleural effusions and right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrates, which are unchanged from yesterday. The repeat sputum gram stain was negative.

The patient's fever overnight reached 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, suggesting an inflammatory response.

The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (hct) level of 26.8%, which is down from 34% on admission. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is normocytic, and the etiology of anemia is unclear. The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable since restarting low-dose NPH insulin at home.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1219**] is a 73 year old female with a PMH significant for
   CAD, CM, COPD, DM, afib s/p pacer admitted with hypoglycemia and
   altered mental status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Given altered mental status, leukocytosis, and
   CXR findings, this likely represents an aspiration versus atypical
   pneumonia.  RSBI this AM 88.  CXR demonstrates bibasilar and RUL
   infiltrates (R>L) unchanged from yesterday.  Repeat sputum gram stain
   negative.
   - RSBI this AM 88, SBT
   - Continue levofloxacin
   - Repeat ABG this AM
   - Wean sedation as possible
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient febrile overnight to 101.2.  Repeat sputum gram
   stain negative.
   - Continue levofloxacin, consider switching to amp/sulbactam for better
   aspiration coverage
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC count
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely secondary to hypoglycemia.
   .
   # ST depression on EKG:  Admission ECG showed ST depression in II, III,
   avL, v3-v4.  Cards was consulted and recommended following CE.  Cardiac
   biomarkers x4 drawn with rise in troponin to 0.04 with flat CK likely
   representing demand ischemia.
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with hct of 26.8 this AM down from 34 on admission.
   MCV normocytic, unclear etiology to anemia.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   # DM: Restarted low dose NPH at home. 24 accuchecks range On NPH at
   home. FS in past 24 hours 213-254.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint includes hypoglycemia, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker (afib s/p pacer).

The patient was admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The respiratory failure is indicated by an elevated respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 88, which suggests the need for mechanical ventilation support. The chest X-ray demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar, and right upper lobe infiltrates unchanged from the previous day. The sputum gram stain is negative.

The patient is febrile overnight with a temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood cultures have been obtained, and levofloxacin has been continued. Considering the aspiration coverage, a switch to amp/sulbactam may be considered. The altered mental status is likely secondary to hypoglycemia.

ST depression on the EKG is present, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Cardiac biomarkers have been drawn with a rise in troponin to 0.04, while the CK level remains flat. The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (hct) level of 26.8% down from 34% on admission. The MCV is normocytic, and the etiology of anemia is unclear. The patient's diabetes mellitus has been managed by restarting low-dose NPH at home, with a fasting blood sugar (FS) range of 213-254 in the past 24 hours. 

Other issues include prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient's code status and disposition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1219**] is a 73 year old female with a PMH significant for CAD, CM,
   COPD, DM, afib s/p pacer admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental
   status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Given altered mental status, leukocytosis, and
   CXR findings, this likely represents an aspiration pneumonia.  RSBI
   this AM 88, patient unlikely to be successful intubation in setting of
   continued fevers and mental status.  CXR demonstrates bibasilar and RUL
   infiltrate unchanged from yesterday, although infiltrate at right base
   improved on CXR.  Repeat sputum gram stain negative.
   - Bronchoscopy yesterday, gram stain from BAL sample negative.
   - ID recs, changed abx to ceftaz and vancomycin
   - discontinued levofloxacin
   - Continue propafol, (amylase & lipase wnl, but triglycerides 749. -->
   repeat
   - RSBI was 74, wean and attempt to extubate.
   .
   # Pneumonia: Patient febrile overnight to 101.3.  Repeat sputum gram
   stain negative.
   - Bronchoscopy yesterday
   - Broadening coverage to ceftaz and vanco
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC count
   .
   #Tahcycardia: Pt with increasing tachycardia this AM  (130's).  Could
   repesent infection given patient has been afebrile vs pt due for BB
   this AM vs agitation vs pancreatits (amylase, lipase wnl)
   -check EKG

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CAD, CM, COPD, DM, and atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker.
- She was admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient has been febrile overnight and her respiratory status has been declining, with an increased respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 74.
- She has a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which has not improved from yesterday.
- A bronchoscopy performed yesterday showed no organisms on gram stain from the BAL sample.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, including ceftazidime and vancomycin.
- The patient's tachycardia is being evaluated, as it may represent infection or another cause.
- She is currently sedated and intubated, but shows some movement and alertness when propofol is turned off.
- There is ST depression on the EKG, which may indicate demand ischemia.
- The patient's hemoglobin level is low, with a hematocrit of 28.2.
- Her diabetes is being managed with increased NPH insulin.
- She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) and will continue to do so.
- Prophylaxis measures include heparin subcutaneously and a bowel regimen.
- The patient has a PICC line in place.
- Code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU level care for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, indicated by the increased RSBI and presence of bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray. This suggests the possibility of respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.

2. Pneumonia: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains febrile and the pneumonia does not seem to be improving. There is a possibility of resistant organisms or inadequate treatment.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's increasing tachycardia could be due to infection, agitation, pancreatitis, or another underlying cause. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hypoglycemia, but other causes such as sepsis or medication effects should also be considered. Close monitoring and management of glucose levels are essential.

5. ST Depression on EKG: The ST depression observed on the EKG may indicate demand ischemia or myocardial infarction. Further evaluation with cardiac biomarkers and continuous monitoring is warranted.

6. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit level indicates anemia. The etiology is unclear, and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration for transfusion may be necessary.

7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with increased NPH insulin, but careful monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation (afib) who was admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed no organisms on gram stain from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. The repeat sputum gram stain was also negative. The patient's respiratory support has been weaned and she was successfully extubated this morning. Chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated bibasilar and right upper lobe infiltrate, which appears slightly improved from yesterday.

The patient is febrile overnight with a temperature of 101.3°F. Blood cultures have been obtained and antibiotics have been continued with ceftazidime and vancomycin. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is slightly elevated.

The patient's tachycardia increased to the 130's this morning. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST depression in leads II, III, avL, v3-v4. Cardiac biomarkers were drawn with a rise in troponin to 0.04, indicating demand ischemia. No intervention will be done until clinical symptoms arise.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased to 28.2%."

   aspiration around acute event.
   1) Respiratory Failure:  Likely pneumonia related to an aspiration
   event when she was altered.  CXR is stable to slightly improved.  S/p
   bronch yesterday with negative microbiology data.  Overall her PNA is
   stable.
   - Will SBT today to evaluate for ability to extubate.  Likely remain
   intubated today because of copius secretions overnight.
   2) ID: Pneumonia
   - s/p bronch yesterday and await results.  Will continue
   vancomycin/levo/ceftaz; if cultures remain negative tomorrow, will
   consider tailoring antibiotics.
   3) Neuro:  Likely initial AMS related to hypoglycemia.  She has been
   able to follow commands when sedation weaned.  However, triglycerides
   are increasing with propofol.
   - daily awakening trial today
   - change sedation from propofol to fentanyl/versed

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1219**] is a 73-year-old female admitted to the ICU for altered mental status (AMS) related to hypoglycemia. She is currently diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) following an aspiration event while altered. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, insulin, and blood thinners. Her current vital signs are stable, but she has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.5, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's chest X-ray is stable to slightly improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia related to aspiration. She may continue to have difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung infection progression.

2. Infectious Disease: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there is a possibility of developing other infections, especially since she is immunocompromised due to her AMS and prolonged ICU stay. Monitoring for new signs of infection, such as fever or worsening leukocytosis, will be important.

3. Neurological Complications: Although the initial AMS was likely related to hypoglycemia,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient was admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental status, which is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood cultures, revealing sparse coag-negative Staphylococcus in the sputum culture.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and ABG values will be necessary. Supportive care, such as providing supplemental oxygen and ensuring adequate ventilation, should be continued.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and ceftazidime should be continued. Monitoring fever curve and white blood cell count is important for assessing the progression of the infection. Follow-up cultures will help determine the effectiveness of the antibiotic treatment.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient continues to be tachycardic with a heart rate in the 110s. Metoprolol IV Q4H has been initiated, and it should be continued. Considering the initiation of digoxin may be appropriate to control heart rate"

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of CAD, CM, COPD, DM, and afib. She was admitted with hypoglycemia and altered mental status likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with BAL and blood cultures NGTD. Sputum culture from 11-14 showed sparse coag negative Staph. She is currently on vancomycin and ceftazadime.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by altered mental status, leukocytosis, and CXR findings. 
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and it is being treated with ceftazadime and vancomycin. Monitoring fever curve and WBC, as well as follow-up cultures, is important.
3. RUE Swelling: The patient's right upper extremity (RUE) swelling may be concerning for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). An RUE ultrasound is recommended, along with bilateral upper extremity plain films of the wrist and elbow. Serum urate should also be checked.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a serum sodium level of 150, indicating a 3.9L free water deficit. Free water IVF should be continued, and serum chemistries should be rechecked this afternoon.

   - Stable respiratory status, can transfer to floor
   2) RUE swelling/pain:  ? gout arthtropathy, though minimal joint
   effusion.  Also should have eval for DVT given edema.
   - Check upper extremity non-invasive, plain films of elbow/wrist
   - Send uric acid
   - Treat with ibuprofen 800mg q8h (she is on a PPI and renal function is
   normal)

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 73-year-old female who was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) related to hypoglycemia. She now has pneumonia (PNA) related to aspiration around an acute event.
- The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable overnight. Today, she complained of new right wrist/elbow pain with associated swelling. There are no lines on that side. She has a history of gout.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 116 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 131/57 to 156/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 4L nasal cannula.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and normal kidney function.
- The patient's renal function is normal, but her liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels.
- The patient's blood cultures have shown Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum.
- The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
   1) Continue current antibiotics given her clinical improvement with the current regimen and a sputum culture with minimal Staph Aureus.
   2) Evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given the edema in her right upper extremity. Check for DVT and consider non-invasive testing or plain films of the elbow/wrist. Send uric acid levels to rule out gout arthropathy. Treat with ibuprofen 800mg q8h.
   3) Titrate insulin coverage today.
   4) Review cardiovascular medications (BB/ASA/Plavix/Statin).
   5) Transfer to the floor today.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has swelling and pain in her right upper extremity, which could be indicative of a DVT. If left untreated, DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism.
2. Gout: The patient has a history of gout and presents with joint pain and swelling. If not managed properly, gout can lead to acute gouty arthritis and potentially kidney damage.
3. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a possibility of further infection due to her compromised immune system. Infections can progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on multiple cardiovascular medications. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was extubated yesterday and remained stable overnight. They did not experience any significant clinical developments or complaints this morning. The patient has allergies to penicillins, morphine, and unknown drugs. They received their last doses of antibiotics, ceftazidime and vancomycin, on 11/17/2109 at 08:17 AM and 09:17 AM respectively. The patient is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium, hydrocortisone, insulin, nebs, Lipitor, Lasix, Plavix, and aspirin.

Flowsheet Data:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate is 116 bpm with a range of 97-122 bpm, blood pressure is 131/57 mmHg with a range of 91/43-156/77 mmHg, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute with a range of 14-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's weight is currently 82.5 kg, which is close to their admission weight of 80 kg. Total fluid intake includes 2,271 mL of IV fluids and 677 mL of PO fluids. Total fluid output includes 2,960 mL of urine output and 440 mL of blood product output. The fluid balance is -689 mL.
- Respiratory support: The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, and their oxygen saturation remains at 96%.
- Physical examination: The patient's peripheral vascular pulses (radial and digital) were not assessed. Skin, neurologic, and other assessments were also not performed.
- Labs/Radiology: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of receiving antibiotics (ceftazidime and vancomycin) which indicates a concern for infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or worsening respiratory status, is important.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance of -689 mL, indicating that more fluid is being lost than gained. This may require close monitoring and potential adjustments to fluid intake and output.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient is still on supplemental oxygen, suggesting possible respiratory difficulties. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and respiratory status is crucial.
4. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Monitoring heart rhythm and potential interventions to control the arrhythmia may be necessary.
5. Medication allergies: The patient has known allergies to penicillins and morph"

   Assessment and Plan
   73F admitted w/ AMS related to hypoglycemia; now with PNA related to
   aspiration around acute event.
   1) ID: Pneumonia
 extubated yesterday, leukocytosis and fever curve
   improving.  Microbiology only with Staph aureus in sputum, otherwise no
   other significant data.
   - Would continue current antibiotics given her clinical improvement
   with current regimen and a sputum culture with minimal Staph Aureus.
   - Stable respiratory status, can transfer to floor
   2) RUE swelling/pain:  ? gout arthtropathy, though minimal joint
   effusion.  Also should have eval for DVT given edema.
   - Check upper extremity non-invasive, plain films of elbow/wrist
   - Send uric acid
   - Treat with ibuprofen 800mg q8h (she is on a PPI and renal function is
   normal)
   3) Endocrine: titrate insulin coverage today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female admitted with altered mental status due to hypoglycemia. She now has pneumonia related to aspiration during her acute event. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently stable. Her leukocytosis and fever curve are improving. The sputum culture shows Staph aureus, but the patient is responding well to the current antibiotics. 

The patient has new right wrist/elbow pain with associated swelling today. This could potentially be gout arthropathy or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the presence of edema. Further evaluation, including non-invasive testing and imaging of the elbow/wrist, is recommended. 

The patient's endocrine status requires titration of insulin coverage today. She is also on medications for cardiovascular disease management, including beta blockers, aspirin, Plavix, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ID (Infection): Pneumonia - The patient's respiratory status is stable, and she is improving with the current antibiotic regimen. However, there is a risk of developing a new infection or worsening of the existing pneumonia.
2. RUE (Right Upper Extremity) swelling/pain - This could be due to gout arthropathy or DVT. Proper evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent complications such as joint damage or pulmonary embolism.
3. Endocrine: Glycemic control - Titration of insulin coverage"
