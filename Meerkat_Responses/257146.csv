   Was brought back to ICU for new-onset hypoxia.  Was found to have
   diffuse ground-glass appearance to lungs on CT scan.  Hypoxia worsened
   and he was intubated.  .   Had a bronchoscopy which was unrevealing for
   cause other than small amount of bleeding.  He became hypotensive and
   tachycardic to 160.  Stayed in sinus.  Was treated with fluid boluses
   until started to develop pulmonary edema.  Lopressor 15 was given,
   which helped bring heart rate down.  Levophed was started for MAP of
   58, he did not respond so phenylephrine and vasopressin started.  Urine
   output has dropped off, but his resp picture is improving.

   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
   2. Interval development of widespread patchy ground-glass opacities.
   Given
   the rapidity of onset, this most likely represents an atypical
   infection or
   drug reaction.
   3. Increased mass-like thickening of the distal esophagus compared to
   the
   [**Month (only) 319**] PET scan, with minimal interval increase in size of prevascular
   lymph
   nodes and gastroesophageal lymph nodes. There is ascites and a nodular
   appearance of the mesentery, which may be due to worsening hepatic
   failure,
   but is also concerning for carcinomatosis.
   4. Stable biilateral pleural effusions.
   BAL, Ascites, and Sputum: NTD
   Urine: small amount of probable enterococcus
   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially thought to be PE and patient
   was started on Heparin despite guaiac positivity.  CTA more consitent
   with ARDS from peritonitis or PNA  (viral or PCP) , hemorrhage,
   aspiration, or influenza versus Pulmonary edema from fluid shifts after
   paracentesis, aggressive resuscitation or decreased EF.  No cardiac hx
   and recent normal echo.  Patient was intubated and put on ARDSnet
   protocol.  He had a bronchoscopy to obtain BAL and eval for
   hemorrhage.  Stopped heparin because not found to have PE on CTA
   - Follow-up BAL results
   - Continue broadened coverage to Vanc/Cipro/Cefepime (expanded GI and
   GNR coverage) as well as Vanc, Zosyn, Azithro
   - Q2 MDIs PRN
   - Continue to monitor ABG
   - Sedation with Fentanyl/Midazolam
   - BNP & Echo to evaluate for heart failure
   - EKG, Cardiac Enzymes
   - Repeat DFA
   # Hypotension with lactic acidosis: Patient's BP ranging from 80s to
   130s systolic, representing pain, and possible underlying sepsis with
   elevated lactate.  DDx: Sepsis vs. hypovolemia vs. cardiogenic shock.
   He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of malnutrition,
   liver disease, and cancer.  Lactate elevated from hypoxia, high work of
   breathing and poor liver clearance.
   - Broaden ABx as above
   - Continue to monitor lactate
   - See above cardiac work-up
   - Wean from pressors as able to
   - Albumin 50g
   .
   # Low UOP: likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.
   Fluid overload and affecting resp status so no boluses at this time.
   BUN/Cr suggests pre-renal origin
   - Boluses with fluid when resp status improves
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, likely representing underlying
   sympathetic drive to breath and pain.  Was given NS boluses to improve
   hydration.  Resp status stable.
   - Fluids when able to tolerate
   - Repeat EKG
   - Continue Mexilitine
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - Treat liver disease based on recs from hepatology
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.
   - Notify Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] and the onc team about admission and f/u any recs
   they may have

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C who was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated over the past 12 hours.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which initially thought to be pulmonary embolism (PE) but was later ruled out through a CT angiography (CTA). The current impression suggests that the cause of the respiratory failure may be acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from peritonitis or pneumonia (viral or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), hemorrhage, aspiration, or influenza.

2. Hypotension with lactic acidosis: The patient's blood pressure has been ranging from the 80s to 130s systolic, indicating possible underlying sepsis with elevated lactate levels. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiogenic shock.

3. Low urine output: The patient's urine output has decreased, suggesting possible ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock. Fluid overload may be affecting the respiratory status, so fluid boluses are not given at this time.

4. Anasarca/liver disease: The patient has signs of liver disease and anasarca (generalized swelling),"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially thought to be PE and patient
   was started on Heparin despite guaiac positivity.  CTA more consitent
   with ARDS from peritonitis or PNA  (viral or PCP) , hemorrhage,
   aspiration, or influenza versus Pulmonary edema from fluid shifts after
   paracentesis, aggressive resuscitation or decreased EF.  No cardiac hx
   and recent normal echo.  Patient was intubated and put on ARDSnet
   protocol.  He had a bronchoscopy to obtain BAL and eval for
   hemorrhage.  Stopped heparin because not found to have PE on CTA
   - Follow-up BAL results
   - Continue broadened coverage to Vanc/Cipro/Cefepime (expanded GI and
   GNR coverage) as well as Vanc, Zosyn, Azithro
   - Q2 MDIs PRN
   - Continue to monitor ABG
   - Sedation with Fentanyl/Midazolam
   - BNP & Echo to evaluate for heart failure
   - EKG, Cardiac Enzymes
   - Repeat DFA
   # Hypotension with lactic acidosis: Patient's BP ranging from 80s to
   130s systolic, representing pain, and possible underlying sepsis with
   elevated lactate.  DDx: Sepsis vs. hypovolemia vs. cardiogenic shock.
   He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of malnutrition,
   liver disease, and cancer.  Lactate elevated from hypoxia, high work of
   breathing and poor liver clearance.
   - Broaden ABx as above
   - Continue to monitor lactate

   # Low UOP: likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.
   Fluid overload and affecting resp status so no boluses at this time.
   BUN/Cr suggests pre-renal origin
   - Boluses with fluid when resp status improves
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, likely representing underlying
   sympathetic drive to breath and pain.  Was given NS boluses to improve
   hydration.  Resp status stable.
   - Fluids when able to tolerate
   - Repeat EKG
   - Continue Mexilitine
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - Treat liver disease based on recs from hepatology
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has developed new-onset hypoxia and requires invasive ventilation. The CT scan shows diffuse ground-glass opacities in the lungs, which may indicate an atypical infection or drug reaction.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the rapid onset of widespread patchy ground-glass opacities and the patient's clinical presentation, ARDS should be considered as a possible complication. The patient has been intubated and placed on the ARDSnet protocol.

3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but there is a concern for pulmonary edema due to fluid shifts after paracentesis, aggressive resuscitation, or decreased ejection fraction. An echocardiogram is planned to evaluate for heart failure.

4. Hepatic failure: The patient has evidence of liver disease, as indicated by the presence of ascites and a nodular appearance of the mesentery. This may contribute to the overall clinical picture and could have implications for the patient's prognosis.

5. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock. Further evaluation, including cardiac enzymes and an echocardiogram, is necessary to determine the cause.

6. Ischemia: The low urine output (oliguria) may be due to renal"

   diffuse ground-glass appearance to lungs on CT scan.  Hypoxia worsened
   and he was intubated.  .   Had a bronchoscopy which was unrevealing for
   cause other than small amount of bleeding.  He became hypotensive and
   tachycardic to 160.  Stayed in sinus.  Was treated with fluid boluses
   until started to develop pulmonary edema.  Lopressor 15 was given,

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C who was admitted to the ICU for new-onset hypoxia. He has diffuse ground-glass appearance to lungs on CT scan and worsening hypoxia. The patient became hypotensive and tachycardic, developed pulmonary edema, and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also has liver disease, anasarca (generalized swelling), and low urine output. The patient's condition is complicated by potential medical complications such as sepsis, hypovolemia, cardiogenic shock, and hepatic failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, lactic acidosis, and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated lactate levels indicate potential hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation and albumin administration have been initiated.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be due to cardiogenic shock. A bedside echocardiogram and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are pending to evaluate cardiac function.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's history of hepatitis C and anasarca suggest possible hepatic failure. Liver function tests and hepatology consultation are"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Initially thought to be PE and patient
   was started on Heparin despite guaiac positivity.  CTA more consitent
   with ARDS from peritonitis or PNA  (viral or PCP) , hemorrhage,
   aspiration, or influenza versus Pulmonary edema from fluid shifts after
   paracentesis, aggressive resuscitation or decreased EF.  No cardiac hx
   and recent normal echo.  Patient was intubated and put on ARDSnet
   protocol.  He had a bronchoscopy to obtain BAL and eval for
   hemorrhage.  Stopped heparin because not found to have PE on CTA
   - Follow-up BAL results
   - Continue broadened coverage to Vanc/Cipro/Cefepime (expanded GI and
   GNR coverage) as well as Vanc, Zosyn, Azithro
   - Q2 MDIs PRN
   - Continue to monitor ABG
   - Sedation with Fentanyl/Midazolam
   - BNP & Echo to evaluate for heart failure
   - EKG, Cardiac Enzymes
   - Repeat DFA
   # Hypotension with lactic acidosis: Patient's BP ranging from 80s to
   130s systolic, representing pain, and possible underlying sepsis with
   elevated lactate.  DDx: Sepsis vs. hypovolemia vs. cardiogenic shock.
   He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of malnutrition,
   liver disease, and cancer.  Lactate elevated from hypoxia, high work of
   breathing and poor liver clearance.
   - Broaden ABx as above
   - Continue to monitor lactate
   - See above cardiac work-up
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, likely representing underlying
   sympathetic drive to breath and pain.  Was given NS boluses to improve
   hydration.  Resp status stable.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Continue Mexilitine
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - Treat liver disease based on recs from hepatology
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU for new-onset hypoxia, which developed over the last 12 hours. The initial assessment suggested pulmonary embolism (PE), but subsequent imaging revealed findings more consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated and placed on the ARDSnet protocol. A bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate for hemorrhage, and heparin was discontinued as no PE was found.

The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, tachycardia, and lactic acidosis. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's low blood pressure may be due to third spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer. Lactate levels are elevated due to hypoxia, high work of breathing, and poor liver clearance.

Other findings include anasarca/liver disease, likely secondary to liver disease, and esophageal cancer, which is thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and 5-FU. The patient's code status is full code, and his brother is designated as the healthcare proxy. Disposition is pending clinical stability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxic respiratory failure has been attributed to AR"

   Was brought back to ICU for new-onset hypoxia.  Was found to have
   diffuse ground-glass appearance to lungs on CT scan.  Hypoxia worsened
   and he was intubated.  .   Had a bronchoscopy which was unrevealing for
   cause other than small amount of bleeding.  He became hypotensive and
   tachycardic to 160.  Stayed in sinus.  Was treated with fluid boluses
   until started to develop pulmonary edema.  Lopressor 15 was given,
   which helped bring heart rate down.  Levophed was started for MAP of
   58, he did not respond so phenylephrine and vasopressin started.  Urine
   output has dropped off, but his resp picture is improving.

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was brought back to the ICU for new-onset hypoxia and was found to have a diffuse ground-glass appearance to his lungs on CT scan. The patient's hypoxia worsened, leading to intubation. A bronchoscopy was performed, which did not reveal any cause other than a small amount of bleeding. The patient then became hypotensive and tachycardic, and fluid boluses were given until pulmonary edema developed. Lopressor was given to bring down the heart rate, and Levophed was started for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 58. However, the patient did not respond, so phenylephrine and vasopressin were started. The patient's urine output has decreased, but his respiratory picture is improving. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be due to pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia (viral or PCP), hemorrhage, aspiration, influenza, or pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, especially considering his history of esophageal cancer, which could have led to cardiac involvement.

 ASCITES
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative,
   rapidly evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from possible pulmonary
   source.
   Initially thought to be PE and patient was started on Heparin despite
   guaiac positivity.  CTA more consitent with ARDS from peritonitis or
   PNA  (viral or PCP) , hemorrhage, aspiration, or influenza versus
   Pulmonary edema from fluid shifts after paracentesis, aggressive
   resuscitation or decreased EF.  No cardiac hx and recent normal echo.
   Patient was intubated and put on ARDSnet protocol.  He had a
   bronchoscopy to obtain BAL and eval for hemorrhage.  Stopped heparin
   because not found to have PE on CTA
   - Follow-up BAL results
   - Broaden coverage to Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  This should cover
   atypicals, gm (+) and gm (-)
   - nebulized treatments q 4 hours
   - Continue to monitor ABG
   - Sedation with Fentanyl/Midazolam
   - BNP & Echo to evaluate for heart failure
   - EKG, Cardiac Enzymes
   - Repeat DFA
   - Stat KUB looking for perf d/t recent paracenteses
   # Hypotension with lactic acidosis: Patient's BP ranging from 80s to
   130s systolic, representing pain, and possible underlying sepsis with
   elevated lactate.  DDx: Sepsis vs. hypovolemia vs. cardiogenic shock.
   He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of malnutrition,
   liver disease, and cancer.  Lactate elevated from hypoxia, high work of
   breathing and poor liver clearance.
   - Broaden ABx as above
   - Continue to monitor lactate
   - See above cardiac work-up
   - Wean from pressors as able to
   - Albumin 50g
   - fluticasone 0.05 and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Low UOP: likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.
   Fluid overload and affecting resp status so no boluses at this time.
   BUN/Cr suggests pre-renal origin
   - Boluses with fluid when resp status improves
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, likely representing underlying
   sympathetic drive to breath and pain.  Was given NS boluses to improve
   hydration.  Resp status stable.
   - Fluids when able to tolerate
   - Repeat EKG
   - Continue Mexilitine if has dosing for renal failure
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - Treat liver disease based on recs from hepatology
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.
   - Notify Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] and the onc team about admission and f/u any recs
   they may have
   - email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] to see if any of chemo drugs could be contributory
   #Access: need to put in L IJ because all peripherals being used at this
   time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure that developed within the last 12 hours. 

The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, with worsening respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, shock, and other complications. The cause of the hypoxic respiratory failure is still uncertain, with possible sources including pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, viral infection, or aspiration.

The patient has been intubated and placed on ARDSnet protocol. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover various pathogens. Additional diagnostic tests and treatments are being planned, including BAL analysis, cardiac enzymes, EKG, repeat DFA, and stat KUB.

The patient's hypotension with lactic acidosis suggests possible sepsis or hypovolemia. The low urine output may be due to pre-renal causes such as ischemia or liver disease. Tachycardia is likely due to sympathetic drive from pain and breathing difficulties.

The patient also has anasarca and liver disease, which may be contributing to his overall condition. His esophageal cancer status is being evaluated, and the oncology team has been notified.

The patient's code status is full code, and he requires further stabilization before considering disposition. His nutritional needs are also being addressed."

   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to

   # Colonic distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not tense.
   KUB concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative.
   Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery, felt
   he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80% mortality).
   Ddx is obstruction, C.diff mediated megacolon and acute
   pseudo-obstruction ([**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome).
   - More stable today so should go for abd CT scan w/ contrast.
   - Repeat C.Diff
   - Continue treating C.Diff w/ IV Flagyl and PO Vanco.
   - NPO for now
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  His BAL fluid was an
   inadequate specimen to rule-out flu, so we are continuing oseltamivir
   for the time being.
   - repeat sputum cultures with endotracheal/mini-BAL sample for flu DFA
   and bacterial culture.
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  Will determine course w/ ID.
   - f/u ID recs.
   - Continue nebulizers and guaifenisen PRN.
   - Check rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary
   hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C.
   # Hypotension: Has been able to come off of pressors except for
   Levophed and his lactate has improved to normal range.  Appears to have
   relatively normal cardiac function.  His hypotension appears to have
   been from shock, which has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from
   sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  His sepsis is likely
   coming from his lungs, though we will culture his peritoneal fluid for
   a possible abdominal source.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim
   test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal
   insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of
   malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   - ABx as above
   - Wean levophed further as tolerated.
   - fluticasone 0.05 and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency
   .
   # Low UOP: Has improved with improving hemodynamics and creatinine is
   stable.  Was likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - f/u hepatology recs
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C, currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's main concerns include shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), constipation, pleural disease, pain control, and ascites.

The patient has been experiencing colonic distension, with his abdomen being distended but not tense. This could be due to obstruction, C. difficile-mediated megacolon, or acute pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome). The patient is currently being treated with a rectal tube placement and broad-spectrum antibiotics for C. difficile. It is recommended to proceed with an abdominal CT scan with contrast and repeat C. difficile testing.

Regarding respiratory failure, the patient has shown improvement in his respiratory status but remains ventilator-dependent on assist control. The presence of extensive ground-glass opacities on the CT scan suggests atypical pneumonia, which is being covered with vancomycin, meropenem, Flagyl, and Cipro. Repeat sputum cultures with endotracheal/mini-BAL sample for flu DFA and bacterial culture are advised. The patient will continue with the current antibiotics and further recommendations from the ID team.

The patient's hypotension has improved and appears to be multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. The patient did not respond to a cortisol stim test on 12/8, so fl"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, septic shock, oliguria resolved, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and adrenal insufficiency. He has been critically ill and is currently in the ICU. The patient has received various treatments including antibiotics, steroids, and pressors. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/64 to 139/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, trace lower extremity edema, warm skin, and normal neurologic response. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed and performing regular mouth care are being taken to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. The use of compression boots is mentioned as prophylaxis against DVT.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old man with several medical conditions including hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, septic shock, oliguria resolved, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient has been critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment in the ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, which means his lungs are not adequately exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory distress.

2. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient is currently being treated for septic shock, indicating a severe systemic infection. If not properly managed, there is a risk of recurrence or progression of sepsis, leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

3. Oliguria: Although the patient's oliguria (decreased urine output) has resolved, there is still a risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's underlying conditions such as cirrhosis and coagulopathy.

4. Cirrhosis and portal hypertension: The patient has cirrhosis, which puts him at risk for complications such as variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding and clotting disorders."

   Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
   1. No evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
   2. Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly, ascites, and gastric varices.
   3. Multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.
   [**12-12**] CXR
   HISTORY: Multifocal pneumonia.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-11**], tip of the ET tube is now
   approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. The tip of the nasogastric tube
   again
   lies within the lower esophagus. Central catheters are in standard
   position.
   Diffuse bilateral airspace consolidations are again seen. Although the
   shift
   and appearance among various images suggests pulmonary edema as the
   primary
   abnormality, the possibility of supervening pneumonia or even ARDS must
   be
   considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   # Colonic distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not tense.
   KUB concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative.
   Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery, felt
   he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80% mortality).
   Ddx is obstruction, C.diff mediated megacolon and acute
   pseudo-obstruction ([**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome). CT scan w/ contrast confirmed
   no anatomic obstruction.  No cause found.  Repeat C. diff negative
   - Continue treating C.Diff w/ IV Flagyl and PO Vanco d/t grim clinical
   scenario
   - NPO for now
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  His BAL fluid was an
   inadequate specimen to rule-out flu, so we are continuing oseltamivir
   for the time being. Checked rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible
   pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C.
   These were both negative.
   - repeat sputum cultures with endotracheal/mini-BAL sample for flu DFA
   and bacterial culture sent yesterday.  Is still pending.
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  Will determine course w/ ID.
   - f/u ID recs.
   - Continue nebulizers and guaifenisen PRN.
   # Hypotension: Has been able to come off of pressors except for
   Levophed and his lactate has improved to normal range.  Appears to have

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with acute onset respiratory distress. His abdomen is distended, and imaging shows distended colon loops without evidence of obstruction or pneumatosis. C. difficile has been ruled out as a cause. The patient has been treated for possible sepsis and pneumonia, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications. He also has hypotension likely due to sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. His condition remains critical, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colonic Distension: The patient's abdomen is distended, and imaging shows distended colon loops. This could be indicative of an obstruction, C. difficile-mediated megacolon, or acute pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome). The CT scan confirmed no anatomic obstruction, and the patient's C. difficile test was negative. 
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe respiratory failure, which appears to be septic in origin from a likely pulmonary source. His respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator dependent. Extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggest atypical pneumonia, for which he is being treated with antibiotics.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including sepsis, adrenal insufficiency"

   3. Multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.
   [**12-12**] CXR
   HISTORY: Multifocal pneumonia.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-11**], tip of the ET tube is now
   approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. The tip of the nasogastric tube
   again
   lies within the lower esophagus. Central catheters are in standard
   position.
   Diffuse bilateral airspace consolidations are again seen. Although the
   shift
   and appearance among various images suggests pulmonary edema as the
   primary
   abnormality, the possibility of supervening pneumonia or even ARDS must
   be
   considered.

   # Colonic distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not tense.
   KUB concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative.
   Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery, felt
   he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80% mortality).
   Ddx is obstruction, C.diff mediated megacolon and acute
   pseudo-obstruction ([**Last Name (un) 5975**]

   no anatomic obstruction.  No cause found.  Repeat C. diff negative
   - Continue treating C.Diff w/ IV Flagyl and PO Vanco d/t grim clinical
   scenario
   - NPO for now
   - decompression with GI today or tomorrow.
   - If decompression does not work, will consider neostigmine
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  His BAL fluid was an
   inadequate specimen to rule-out flu, so we are continuing oseltamivir
   for the time being. Checked rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible
   pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C.
   These were both negative.
   - repeat sputum cultures with endotracheal/mini-BAL sample for flu DFA
   and bacterial culture sent yesterday.  Is still pending.
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  Will determine course w/ ID.
   - Continue nebulizers and guaifenisen PRN.
   - Fix abdominal issues as above.
   # Hypotension: Has been able to come off of pressors except for
   Levophed and his lactate has improved to normal range.  Appears to have
   relatively normal cardiac function.  His hypotension appears to have
   been from shock, which has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from
   sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  His sepsis is likely
   coming from his lungs, though we will culture his peritoneal fluid for
   a possible abdominal source.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C.
- He was admitted to the ICU with acute onset respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been diagnosed with colonic distension, which is likely due to acute pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) rather than anatomic obstruction.
- He has also been diagnosed with respiratory failure, which appears to be septic in nature and is suspected to have originated from a pulmonary source.
- The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring the use of vasopressors, but has shown improvement.
- His liver disease and malnutrition may be contributing to hypotension and low urine output.
- The patient has anasarca, which is likely related to liver disease.
- His esophageal cancer was previously treated with chemotherapy, but there is no mention of active treatment at this time.
- The patient has multiple lines and ports for medication administration.
- Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Colonic distension: The patient's distended abdomen and the presence of dilated colon loops on imaging suggest a potential complication related to colonic distension. This could lead to further bowel ischem"

","The patient is a 58-year-old man with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include shock and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, septic shock, oliguria, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure (95/52 mmHg), increased heart rate (62 bpm), and decreased urine output (oliguria). His oxygen saturation is within normal range (100%). The patient is currently receiving several medications including fentanyl, norepinephrine, famotidine, heparin sodium, folate, midazolam, ciprofloxacin, H2 blockers, tamiflu, colace, flagyl, fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, meropenem, and enteral vancomycin.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 30 K/uL), elevated creatinine level (0.8 mg/dL), low albumin level (2.7 g/dL), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and elevated lactate levels (1.9 mmol/L).

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 410 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  His BAL fluid was an
   inadequate specimen to rule-out flu, so we are continuing oseltamivir
   for the time being. Checked rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible
   pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C.
   These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, will trial SBT this morning
   - repeat sputum cultures with endotracheal/mini-BAL sample for flu DFA
   and bacterial culture sent yesterday.  Is still pending.
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  Will determine course w/ ID.
   - Continue nebulizers and guaifenisen PRN.
   - Fix abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Colonic distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not tense.
   KUB concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative.
   Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery, felt
   he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80% mortality).
   Ddx is obstruction, C.diff mediated megacolon and acute
   pseudo-obstruction ([**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome). CT scan w/ contrast confirmed
   no anatomic obstruction.  No cause found.  Repeat C. diff negative
   - Continue treating C.Diff w/ IV Flagyl and PO Vanco d/t grim clinical
   scenario
   - NPO for now
   - decompression with GI today
   - If decompression does not work, will consider neostigmine
   .
   # Hypotension: Has been able to come off of pressors except for
   Levophed and his lactate has improved to normal range.  Appears to have
   relatively normal cardiac function.  His hypotension appears to have
   been from shock, which has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator dependent on assist control. He has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, for which he is being covered with antibiotics. 

The patient also has colonic distension, which may be due to C. difficile colitis or acute pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome). His abdomen is distended but not tense, and he has had some improvement with rectal tube placement. Surgery has deemed him too high risk for surgery due to an estimated 80% mortality rate. 

The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, likely from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. He has been weaned off most pressors, except for levophed. His lactate levels have improved to normal range.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped to 21.2 from 24 this morning, which may be due to bleeding or anemia. He is being transfused with packed red blood cells.

The patient's urine output has improved with improving hemodynamics, and his creatinine levels are stable.

The patient has anasarca/liver disease, which is most likely due to liver disease, although cardiac"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old man with several medical conditions including hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, septic shock, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, adrenal insufficiency, and [**Last Name (un) 5975**] syndrome. He has been in the ICU and is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/46 mmHg to 124/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His central venous pressure is 13 mmHg, and he has received a total of 2,127 mL of fluids since midnight with a balance of -1,803 mL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including sedatives, analgesics, vasopressors, antibiotics, and other supportive medications. His laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 410 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 228, and other values within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals generalized edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination. Imaging studies have been performed but are not provided in the note.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of the patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, septic shock, cirrhosis, coagulopathy, adrenal insufficiency, and [**Last Name (un) 5975**] syndrome. The plan involves continued hemodynamic management, steroids, and time to improve substantially. The patient will undergo further testing, including obtaining another C. difficile test, continuing current antibiotics, holding sedation for spontaneous breathing trials, monitoring hemoglobin levels, and considering neostigmine if [**Last Name (un) 5975**] recurs. The patient will be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for today with a trial of tube feeding (TF) tomorrow, and if unsuccessful, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) will be considered.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), infections such as C. difficile colitis, hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, and cardiovascular instability due to septic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  His BAL fluid was an
   inadequate specimen to rule-out flu, so we are continuing oseltamivir
   for the time being. Checked rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible
   pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C.
   These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, will trial SBT this morning
   - repeat sputum cultures with endotracheal/mini-BAL sample for flu DFA
   and bacterial culture sent yesterday.  NTD
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.
   - Continue nebulizers and guaifenisen PRN.
   - Fix abdominal issues as below

   KUB concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative.
   Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery, felt
   he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80% mortality).

   no anatomic obstruction.  No cause found.  Repeat C. diff negative
   - Stop treating C.Diff w/ IV Flagyl and PO Vanco d/t  3 negative cdiff
   - NPO for now
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - neostigmine?
   .
   # Hypotension: Has been able to come off of pressors except for
   Levophed and his lactate has improved to normal range.  Appears to have
   relatively normal cardiac function.  His hypotension appears to have
   been from shock, which has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from
   sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  His sepsis is likely
   coming from his lungs, though we will culture his peritoneal fluid for
   a possible abdominal source.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim
   test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal
   insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of
   malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is characterized by inadequate oxygenation of the blood. This could be due to septic shock from a likely pulmonary source. The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly but they remain ventilator dependent.

2. Atypical pneumonia: The patient has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan, which are suggestive of atypical pneumonia. This is being covered with antibiotics (Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro). The patient is also being given oseltamivir for possible influenza infection.

3. Colonic distension and potential obstruction: The patient's abdomen is distended, and there was a concern for dramatically distended colon. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out as a cause. The patient's colonic distension has partially improved with rectal tube placement. Acute pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) is also a possibility. No anatomic obstruction was found on CT scan. The patient's bowel regimen needs to be aggressive, and neostigmine may be considered.

4. Hypotension: The patient has been able to come off most pressors except for Levophed. The hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. The"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that developed over the last 12 hours. The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator-dependent on assist control. He has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which is being covered with antibiotics.

The patient's abdomen is distended, but not tense. There was concern for dramatically distended colon, which was confirmed by KUB. C. difficile has been ruled out three times. The patient is NPO for now and is receiving an aggressive bowel regimen.

The patient's hypotension appears to have been from shock, which has improved. His hypotension is multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. He did not respond to a cortisol stim test, so he is being given fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. He also has likely third spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped to 21.2 from 24 this morning, but has stabilized at 23. He is being closely monitored for any further changes.

The patient's urine output has improved with improving hemodynamics, and his creatinine levels are stable. It was likely ischem"

   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro vs. ARDS.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, failed SBT.  Keep intubated until resp
   issues improve
   - repeat sputum cultures with endotracheal/mini-BAL sample for flu DFA
   and bacterial culture sent yesterday.  NTD

   # Hypotension: Has been able to come off of pressors except for
   Levophed and his lactate has improved to normal range.  Appears to have
   relatively normal cardiac function.  His hypotension appears to have
   been from shock, which has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from
   sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  His sepsis is likely
   coming from his lungs, though we will culture his peritoneal fluid for
   a possible abdominal source.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim
   test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal
   insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of
   malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He has been admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure that developed over the last 12 hours. The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator dependent on assist control. He has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan, suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which is being covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro antibiotics. 

The patient also has colonic distension and was previously suspected of having Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, but subsequent tests have ruled out this diagnosis. He is also being evaluated for possible acute pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome). 

Additionally, the patient has hypotension and has required vasopressor support, although he has recently been able to come off most of the pressors except for Levophed. His lactate levels have improved to normal range. 

Furthermore, the patient has experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration, which has since stabilized. 

Other notable findings include anasarca/liver disease, low urine output, and a history of esophageal cancer thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and 5-FU chemotherapy. 

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, propofol, famotidine, midazolam, and various other medications.

   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  His BAL fluid was an
   inadequate specimen to rule-out flu, so we are continuing oseltamivir
   for the time being. Checked rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible
   pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C.
   These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, will trial SBT this morning
   - repeat sputum cultures with endotracheal/mini-BAL sample for flu DFA
   and bacterial culture sent yesterday.  Is still pending.
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Flagyl/Cipro.  Will determine course w/ ID.
   - Continue nebulizers and guaifenisen PRN.
   - Fix abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Colonic distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not tense.
   KUB concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative.
   Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery, felt
   he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80% mortality).
   Ddx is obstruction, C.diff mediated megacolon and acute
   pseudo-obstruction ([**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome). CT scan w/ contrast confirmed
   no anatomic obstruction.  No cause found.  Repeat C. diff negative
   - Continue treating C.Diff w/ IV Flagyl and PO Vanco d/t grim clinical
   scenario
   - NPO for now
   - decompression with GI today
   - If decompression does not work, will consider neostigmine
   .
   # Hypotension: Has been able to come off of pressors except for
   Levophed and his lactate has improved to normal range.  Appears to have
   relatively normal cardiac function.  His hypotension appears to have
   been from shock, which has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from
   sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  His sepsis is likely
   coming from his lungs, though we will culture his peritoneal fluid for
   a possible abdominal source.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim
   test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal
   insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of
   malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   - ABx as above
   - Wean levophed further as tolerated.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He has been admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure that developed within the last 12 hours. The patient's respiratory status has slightly improved but he remains dependent on ventilator assistance. He also has extensive ground-glass opacities on a CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which is being covered with antibiotics.

The patient's previous medical issues include colonic distension, low urine output, hypotension, and anasarca/liver disease. The colonic distension is thought to be due to a combination of possible C. difficile infection, acute pseudo-obstruction, and an obstruction without anatomic cause. The patient is being treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin for C. difficile, and decompression with GI intervention is planned if the current measures do not work.

The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, likely due to sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. The patient did not respond to a cortisol stim test, so he is being given fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. The low urine output is thought to be due to ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock. The anasarca/liver disease is most likely due to liver disease, although some cardiac involvement cannot be ruled"

   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours. \
   .
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro vs. ARDS.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, failed SBT.  Keep intubated until resp
   issues improve
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro (day [**7-2**])
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Colonic distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not tense.
   KUB was concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative
   X3.  Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery,
   felt he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80%
   mortality).  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction.
   Decompressed by GI.   KUB improved
   - repeat KUB qday to assure no bowel dilation return
   - Stop treating C.Diff w/ IV Flagyl and PO Vanco d/t  3 negative cdiff
   - NPO for now
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - neostigmine 2mg with 0.04glycopyrrolate
   .
   # Hypotension: His hypotension appears to have been from shock, which
   has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal
   insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim
   test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal
   insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of
   malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   - ABx as above
   - fludricortisone 0.1 and hydrocortisone  75 for adrenal insufficiency;
   start to wean today
   - Albumin 1g/kg today (decided on 75 total)
   .
   #Hct drop: Dropped to 21.2 from 24 this morning.  Rechecked 4 hours
   later and was 23 has been steady at 23.  Is pancyotpenic.  Possible
   shock reaction, possibly from chemo or some primary bone marrow
   source.

   .
   # Low UOP: Has improved with improving hemodynamics and creatinine is
   stable.  Was likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.

   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - hep recs leaving draining paracentesis site for now and hoping will
   close on own
   - Albumin 1g/kg today
   - lactulose for liver disease and bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, which has been rapidly evolving. The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator-dependent on assist control. Extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggest atypical pneumonia, for which he is being covered with antibiotics. The patient also has colonic distension without tension, confirmed by CT scan without anatomic obstruction. He is receiving a bowel regimen and has had a rectal tube placed. The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. He is being treated with corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 24 to 21.2 and then stabilized at 23, indicating possible pancytopenia. He is receiving albumin daily due to ongoing auto-paracentesis through a para site from I.R. The patient's anasarca and encephalopathy are likely related to cirrhosis, and he is being managed with lactulose. Coagulopathy, adrenal insufficiency, and pancytopenia are also present. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, septic shock, cirrhosis, encephalopathy, anasar"

   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours. \
   .
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro vs. ARDS.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, failed SBT.  Keep intubated until resp
   issues improve
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro (day [**7-2**])
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below

   # Colonic distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not tense.
   KUB was concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative
   X3.  Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery,
   felt he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80%
   mortality).  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction.

   # Hypotension: His hypotension appears to have been from shock, which
   has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal
   insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim
   test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal
   insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of
   malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   - ABx as above
   - fludricortisone 0.1 and hydrocortisone  75 for adrenal insufficiency;
   start to wean today

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure that developed over the last 12 hours. The patient has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan, which suggests atypical pneumonia. He is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation. His respiratory status has improved slightly but remains ventilator-dependent. The patient is also being treated for colonic distension, hypotension, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, low urine output, anasarca/liver disease, and esophageal cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggest the possibility of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Close monitoring and appropriate management of oxygenation and ventilation are crucial.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's rapid evolution of symptoms, negative cultures except for a possible Enterococcus infection in the urine, and presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood counts, and organ function is necessary.
3. Colonic Distension: Although the patient's colonic distension has partially improved with rectal tube placement and conservative measures, it remains a concern. Continuous monitoring for signs of bowel obstruction or perforation is essential.
4. Adrenal Insuff"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He has been admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure that developed within the last 12 hours. The patient is ventilator-dependent on assist control and has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia. He is being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has colonic distension without anatomic obstruction, which has been partially improved with rectal tube placement. There is concern for sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he has a low urine output. His hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 24 to 21.2 and then stabilized at 23. He has anasarca/liver disease and a history of esophageal cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly but remains ventilator-dependent. There is a possibility of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient appears to be septic from a likely pulmonary source. There is a risk of worsening sepsis and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient did not respond to a cortisol stimulation test, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency. This condition can lead to life-threatening complications if not properly managed."

   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which we
   are covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, failed SBT due to tachypnea.  Keep
   intubated until resp issues improve
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro (day [**8-1**]); extend course for 3 more
   days while still critical
   - Sedation on propofol 30 and fentanyl 50 as is
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.

   Decompressed by GI.   KUB improved.  Serial KUB do not show
   reappearance of distention. Neostigmine 2mg with 0.04glycopyrrolate
   given with no large BM or change in distention
   - therapeutic distention
   - return tube feeds to normal rate gradually
   - aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, which has been rapidly progressing. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with assist control. The patient has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan, suggestive of atypical pneumonia or ARDS. He is being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has abdominal distension, likely due to Ogilvie's syndrome, which has not responded to neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Surgery has deemed him too high risk for an operation. His hypotension appears to be multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. He is being treated for adrenal insufficiency with fluticasone and hydrocortisone. The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration and is pancytopenic, possibly due to a shock reaction, primary bone marrow source, or chemotherapy. His low urine output has improved with improving hemodynamics. The patient has anasarca and liver disease, possibly secondary to liver disease or cardiac involvement. He is being managed conservatively with paracentesis, albumin administration, and lactulose for liver disease and bowel regimen. The patient's esophageal cancer is thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and 5"

   is worsening bilateral airspace opacification, especially within the
   left lung. There is continued low lung volume on the right.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly
   evolving CXRs, appears to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His
   respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator
   dependent on assist control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia, which we are
   covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro vs. ARDS.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, failed SBT.  Keep intubated until resp
   issues improve
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro (day [**8-1**]); extend course for 3 more
   days
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Colonic distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not tense.
   KUB was concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff negative
   X3.  Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by surgery,
   felt he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80%
   mortality).  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction.
   Decompressed by GI.   KUB improved
   - repeat KUB qday to assure no bowel dilation return
   - NPO for now
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - neostigmine 2mg with 0.04glycopyrrolate
   .
   # Hypotension: His hypotension appears to have been from shock, which
   has improved.  Hypotension multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal
   insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim
   test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal
   insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of
   malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   - ABx as above
   - fludricortisone 0.05 and hydrocortisone  50 for adrenal
   insufficiency; start to wean today
   - Albumin 1g/kg today (decided on 75 total)
   .
   #Hct drop: Dropped to 21.2 from 24 this morning.  Rechecked 4 hours
   later and was 23 has been steady at 23.  Is pancyotpenic.  Possible
   shock reaction, possibly from chemo or some primary bone marrow
   source.

   # Low UOP: Has improved with improving hemodynamics and creatinine is

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure that developed over the last 12 hours. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to be septic from a likely pulmonary source. His respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator-dependent on assist control. He has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia.

2. Colonic distension: The patient's abdomen is distended, but not tense. A CT scan confirmed no anatomic obstruction, and he was decompressed by GI. The KUB improved, and he will continue to have repeat KUB daily to ensure no bowel dilation returns.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. He did not respond to a cortisol stim test, so he is being given fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. He also has likely third spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.

4. Hct drop: The patient's hematocrit dropped to 21.2 from 24 this morning. It has been steady at 23 since then. He is pancytopen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and recent esophageal cancer, currently admitted for fatigue and hypotension. The patient developed septic shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has multiple medical issues including cirrhosis, encephalopathy, anasarca, coagulopathy, adrenal insufficiency, and pancytopenia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, spinal fluid infection, and possible intra-abdominal source of initial septic shock. The patient's condition is complicated by ongoing fluid leakage and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure has progressed to ARDS, which can lead to severe lung damage and respiratory failure.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock requires prompt management to prevent further organ dysfunction and potential death.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia increases the risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hep C and recent esophageal cancer in remission.
- The patient presented with fatigue and hypotension, which resolved. However, he later experienced 3-pressor shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- The patient has profound pulmonary infiltrates, indicating Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient is currently on Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) and has shown improvement.
- He is also experiencing septic shock, which has improved, and is being treated with antibiotics.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis, encephalopathy, anasarca, coagulopathy, adrenal insufficiency, and pancytopenia.
- He requires ongoing support with mechanical ventilation and sedation.
- The patient's tube feeds are being increased, and he is receiving nutrition through Nutren Pulmonary.
- He will continue to receive neostigmine and hydrocortisone.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure and ARDS may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, which can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lung injury.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay. This includes the risk of"

   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Plan is to keep intubated this morning until
   after paracentesis.  Should improve pleural effusion and abdominal
   distention, then hopefully allow for extubation.   He has new,
   extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical
   pneumonia vs ARDS, which we are covering with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.
   Flu negative. Checked rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible
   pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C.
   These were both negative.
   BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative.
   - Plan paracentesis followed by SBT
   - stopped antibiotics as he had completed a course.
   - Sedation on propofol 30 and fentanyl 50 as is
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On Saturday, Neostigmine 2mg
   with 0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention
   - plan for therapeutic paracentesis today.
   - return tube feeds to normal rate gradually
   - aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   .
   # Hypotension: wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial from sepsis,
   adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not respond to a
   cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   - continue to wean down from fludricortisone 0.05 and hydrocortisone
   50mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, continue to wean daily
   .
   #Hct drop: Has been steady at 23 >48hours.  Is pancyotpenic.  Possible
   shock reaction, possibly from chemo or some primary bone marrow
   source.

   .
   # Low UOP: Has improved with improving hemodynamics and creatinine is
   stable.  Was likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.

   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - hep recs leaving draining paracentesis site for now and hoping will

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He has been admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure that developed within the last 12 hours.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP mode. His ABG results show a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245, indicating respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury. The plan is to keep the patient intubated until after paracentesis and then attempt extubation.

2. Septic shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock, as indicated by hypotension and tachycardia. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro) to cover atypical pneumonia and possible bacterial infection. Other lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting an ongoing inflammatory response.

3. Abdominal distension: The patient has abdominal distension, which is non-tense but significant. A CT scan has ruled out anatomic obstruction, and the patient has been diagnosed with [**Last Name (un) 5975**] syndrome. Colonoscopic decompression has been performed, and"

   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Keep intubated this morning until after
   paracentesis.  Should improve pleural effusion and abdominal
   distention, then hopefully allow for extubation.
   BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative, rapidly evolving CXRs, appears
   to be septic from likely pulmonary source.  His respiratory status has
   improved slightly but he remains ventilator dependent on assist
   control.  He has new, extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan
   suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which we are covering with
   Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked rheumatoid factor and
   cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given
   history of Hep C. These were both negative.
   - passed RSBI this morning, failed SBT due to tachypnea.  Keep
   intubated until resp issues improve
   - Continue Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro (day [**8-1**]); extend course for 3 more
   days while still critical
   - Sedation on propofol 30 and fentanyl 50 as is
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  KUB was concerning for dramatically distended colon.  C-diff
   negative X3.  Partially improved with rectal tube placement.  Seen by
   surgery, felt he was too high risk to even consider OR (estimated 80%
   mortality).  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction.
   Decompressed by GI.   KUB improved.  Serial KUB do not show
   reappearance of distention. Neostigmine 2mg with 0.04glycopyrrolate
   given with no large BM or change in distention
   - therapeutic distention
   - return tube feeds to normal rate gradually
   - aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   .
   # Hypotension: wean steroids.
   His hypotension appears to have been from shock, which has improved.
   Hypotension multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver
   disease.  He did not respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are
   giving fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He
   does have likely d/t 3rd spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver
   disease, and cancer.
   - ABx as above
   - fludricortisone 0.05 and hydrocortisone  50mg q6 for adrenal
   insufficiency, continue to wean daily
   - Blood today for volume and cytopenia
   .
   #Hct drop: Has been steady at 23 >48hours.  Is pancyotpenic.  Possible
   shock reaction, possibly from chemo or some primary bone marrow
   source.
   - q12 hour crit
   -<21 for transfusion
   .
   # Low UOP: Has improved with improving hemodynamics and creatinine is
   stable.  Was likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.
   .
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - hep recs leaving draining paracentesis site for now and hoping will
   close on own
   - Albumin 1g/kg today tomorrow possibly.  1 u PRBC today
   - lactulose for liver disease and bowel regimen
   .
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.
   - f/u whether Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**] has input.
   .
   #Access: L IJ, A line, chemo port and PIV.
   #FEN: replete electrolytes PRN, Nutren pulmonary tube feeds
   #Prophy: pneumoboots, heparin TID, type and screen; lactulose for bowel
   regimen
   #Code status: Full Code
   #Communication: Patient; brother is health care proxy
   #Dispo: pending clinical stability
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, which developed over the last 12 hours. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains ventilator-dependent on assist control due to respiratory failure. He has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is being covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro antibiotics.

2. Constipation: The patient has constipation, possibly due to fos. It is recommended to continue lactulose for bowel regimen.

3. Pleural Disease: The patient has pleural effusion and abdominal distention, which may improve after paracentesis.

4. Shock and Septic: The patient initially presented with shock and septicemia, likely due to a pulmonary source. His respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator-dependent.

5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. He did not respond to a cortisol stimulation test, so he is being given fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.

6. Pancytopenia: The patient is p"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He has been admitted to the ICU for new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, which has developed over the last 12 hours. The patient appears to be septic from a likely pulmonary source and has extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly but he remains ventilator-dependent on assist control. He passed the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) this morning but failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to tachypnea. Therefore, he will be kept intubated until his respiratory issues improve. 

Medications include vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin, which will be continued for three more days while still critical. Sedation will be maintained with propofol and fentanyl as is. Nebulizers and Mucinex will be given as needed.

The patient also has abdominal distension, which has been partially improved with rectal tube placement. Surgery felt that the patient was too high risk for an operation, estimating an 80% mortality rate. A CT scan with contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, and the patient was decompressed by GI. Serial abdominal X-rays do not show reappearance of distention. Neostigmine with glycopyrrol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with hep C and esophageal cancer admitted to the ICU for fatigue and hypertensive emergency. He initially presented with shock and was transferred to the MICU, then back to the floor, and finally returned to the ICU due to pressor-dependent shock. The patient has shown improvement, but still exhibits signs of Oglivie's syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday and also shows evidence of adrenal dysfunction. 

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a severe lung condition that can occur as a complication of an infection or injury. ARDS leads to fluid accumulation in the lungs, making it difficult for the patient to breathe.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation with shock suggests septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to inadequate blood flow to the organs.
3. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient has been diagnosed with constipation, possibly due to medications or Oglivie's syndrome. This can lead to abdominal distension and discomfort.
4. Pleural Disease: The patient has pleural disease, which may be related to his esophageal cancer. Pleural disease affects the lining of the lungs and can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing.
5. Pain Control: The patient requires pain management due to both acute and chronic pain related to his"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Plan is to keep intubated this morning until
   after paracentesis.  Should improve pleural effusion and abdominal
   distention, then hopefully allow for extubation.   He had extensive
   ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs
   ARDS, which we are covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative.
   Checked rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary
   hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were
   both negative.
   BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative.  Paracentesis yesterday.
   - stopped antibiotics as he had completed a course.
   - Sedation on propofol 30 and fentanyl 50 as is
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On Saturday, Neostigmine 2mg
   with 0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention
   Therapeutic paracentesis yesterday.
   - aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   .
   # Hypotension: wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial from sepsis,
   adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not respond to a
   cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - hydrocortisone  25mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, continue to wean
   daily
   .
   #Hct drop: Has been steady at 23 >48hours.  Is pancyotpenic.  Possible
   shock reaction, possibly from chemo or some primary bone marrow
   source.
   - q12 hour crit
   -<21 for transfusion
   .
   # Low UOP: Has improved with improving hemodynamics and creatinine is
   stable.  Was likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.

   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - hep recs leaving draining paracentesis site for now and hoping will
   close on own
   - Albumin 1g/kg today

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, which developed within the last 12 hours. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, abdominal distension, hypotension, Hct drop, low urine output (UOP), anasarca/liver disease, and esophageal cancer.

Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The plan is to keep him intubated until after paracentesis to improve pleural effusion and abdominal distention, then hopefully allow for extubation. He had extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia or ARDS, for which he is being covered with antibiotics.

Abdominal distension: The patient's abdomen is distended, but not tense. A CT scan with contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, indicating he has syndrome. The colon was decompressed using a colonoscope by the GI team. The patient's KUB improved but then worsened again. On Saturday, neostigmine 2mg with glycopyrrolate was given without any large bowel movements or change in distention. A therapeutic paracentesis was performed yesterday.

The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was previously on pressors but is now off them. The patient underwent a paracentesis at 03:00 PM on [**2130-12-18**]. He has been receiving various medications including famotidine, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/74 mmHg to 159/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40% and has a spontaneous respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. His ABG results show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 293, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 77. Physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, but no other significant findings.

   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Paracentesis yesterday which should improve
   pleural effusion and abdominal distention, hopefully successful
   extubation today.   He had extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan
   suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which had covered with
   Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked rheumatoid factor and
   cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia given
   history of Hep C. These were both negative.
   BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative.  Paracentesis yesterday.
   - stopped antibiotics as he had completed a course.
   - Sedation weaned
   - Extubation today
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On Saturday, Neostigmine 2mg
   with 0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention
   Therapeutic paracentesis yesterday resolved distension
   - aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   - cipro 250 daily for prophylaxis until drain from para is removed.
   .
   # Hypotension (corrected): wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial
   from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not
   respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - hydrocortisone  25mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, continue to wean
   daily
   .
   #Hct drop: s/p blood transfusion 2 days ago.  Has improved and been
   stable .  Is pancyotpenic.  Possible shock reaction, possibly from
   chemo or some primary bone marrow source.
   - q12 hour crit
   -<21 for transfusion
   .
   # Low UOP: Has improved with improving hemodynamics and creatinine is
   stable.  Was likely ischemia in the setting of hypotension from shock.
   .
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - hep recs leaving draining paracentesis site for now and hoping will
   close on own
   - start Cipro 250 daily for prophy because drain from paracentesis is
   still in
   - lactulose for liver disease and bowel regimen
   .
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.

 ASCITES
   58 yo male with esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning to
   the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that has developed in the
   last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Has now been extubated 24 hrs.  Improving CXR
   but with coarse central airways sounds.   He had extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which
   had covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative.
   BNP 743 and echo normal, CTA negative.  Paracentesis yesterday.
   - Got lasix 20mg twice yesterday which made him only -400ccs for the
   day w/o affecting his creatinine.  Start lasix gtt.
   - stopped antibiotics as he had completed a course.
   - Sedation weaned
   - Extubation today
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On Saturday, Neostigmine 2mg
   with 0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention
   Therapeutic paracentesis yesterday resolved distension
   - aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   - cipro 250 daily for prophylaxis until para site stops draining.
   .
   # Hypotension (corrected): wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial
   from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not
   respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - hydrocortisone  25mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, continue to wean
   daily.  Will likely require a basal dose.
   .
   #Hct drop: s/p blood transfusion 2 days ago.  Has improved and been
   stable .  Is pancyotpenic.  Possible shock reaction, possibly from
   chemo or some primary bone marrow source.
   - q12 hour crit
   -<21 for transfusion
   .
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement
   - hep recs leaving draining paracentesis site for now and hoping will
   close on own
   - start Cipro 250 daily for prophy because drain from paracentesis is
   still in
   - lactulose for liver disease and bowel regimen
   .
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.

   .
   # Respiratory failure: Has now been extubated 24 hrs.  Improving CXR
   but with coarse central airways sounds.   He had extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which
   had covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from

   Extubated on [**12-18**]. Currently tachypneic and alkalemic.
   - Got lasix 20mg yesterday which made him only -400cc
s for the day w/o
   affecting his creatinine. Plan today for: lasix bolus, start with a
   20mg bolus now.
   - Stopped antibiotics as he had completed a full course, afebrile.
   - Sedation weaned
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On [**12-16**], Neostigmine 2mg with
   0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention.
   Improved, he is now having BM
   - Aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   - Discontinue Cipro prophylaxis.
   .
   # Hypotension (corrected): wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial
   from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not
   respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - Previously on hydrocortisone 25mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, wean
   to 12.5mg q6h today. Continue to wean, plan to likely d/c tomorrow.
   .
   #Hct drop: s/p blood transfusion 2 days ago.  Has improved and been
   stable. Is pancytopenic.  Possible shock reaction, possibly from chemo
   or questionable primary bone marrow source.
   - q12 hour Hct checks
   - Transfuse for Hct <21

   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement. S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   - Hepaotology recommends leaving draining paracentesis site for now and
   hoping will close on own
   - Start Cipro 250 daily for prophylaxis because drain from paracentesis
   is still in

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure that developed within the last 12 hours. His current conditions include respiratory failure, abdominal distension, hypotension, anemia, anasarca/liver disease, and potential esophageal cancer.

The patient has been extubated and is improving, but still tachypneic and alkalemic. He is receiving Lasix bolus and nebulizers with Mucinex as needed. Antibiotics have been stopped since he completed a full course and is afebrile. Sedation has been weaned, and he is being treated for abdominal issues.

His abdominal distension is due to [**Last Name (un) 5975**] syndrome, confirmed by a CT scan without anatomic obstruction. The colon was decompressed colonoscopically by GI, but his KUB worsened again. He is now on an aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose and no longer on Cipro prophylaxis.

The patient's hypotension is multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. He did not respond to a cortisol stim test on [**12-8**], so he is being given fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. His hydrocortisone dosage will be weaned from"

   58 y/o male with Esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning
   to the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that had developed in
   the last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Has now been extubated 24 hrs.  Improving CXR
   but with coarse central airways sounds.   He had extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which
   had covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative. BNP
   743 and echo normal, CTA negative.  S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   Extubated on [**12-18**]. Currently tachypneic and alkalemic.
   - Got lasix 20mg yesterday which made him only -400cc
s for the day w/o
   affecting his creatinine. Plan today for: lasix bolus, start with a
   20mg bolus now.
   - Stopped antibiotics as he had completed a full course, afebrile.
   - Sedation weaned
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On [**12-16**], Neostigmine 2mg with
   0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention.
   Improved, he is now having BM
   - Aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   - Discontinue Cipro prophylaxis.
   .
   # Hypotension (corrected): wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial
   from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not
   respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely d/t 3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - Previously on hydrocortisone 25mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, wean
   to 12.5mg q6h today. Continue to wean, plan to likely d/c tomorrow.
   .
   #Hct drop: s/p blood transfusion 2 days ago.  Has improved and been
   stable. Is pancytopenic.  Possible shock reaction, possibly from chemo
   or questionable primary bone marrow source.
   - q12 hour Hct checks
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   .
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement. S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   - Hepaotology recommends leaving draining paracentesis site for now and
   hoping will close on own
   - Does not have history of SBP, so no cipro prophylaxis for now.
   - Lactulose for liver disease and bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He has been admitted to the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure, which developed over the last 12 hours.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient had extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan, suggestive of atypical pneumonia or ARDS. He was initially intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but has now been extubated.

2. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdomen is distended but not tense. A CT scan confirmed no anatomic obstruction, indicating he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**] syndrome. The colon was decompressed colonoscopically by GI.

3. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. He did not respond to a cortisol stim test, so he is being given fluticasone and hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.

4. Anemia: The patient has experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration after a blood transfusion two days ago. This could be due to a possible shock reaction or primary bone marrow source.

5. Anasarca/liver disease: The patient most likely has liver disease, which may be causing anasarca (generalized swelling)."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis. He was admitted for weakness and shortness of breath and subsequently developed shock and respiratory failure. The patient has shown improvement but remains critically ill. He is currently receiving various medications, including diuretics, pain management, and prophylactic measures. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has positive fluid balance, edema in both lower extremities, and soft abdomen with distention. His laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's history of HCV cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to cirrhosis and critical illness increases the risk of infection, particularly sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure and ongoing respiratory distress may lead to further complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Bleeding: The use of anticoagulant medication for prophylaxis increases the risk of bleeding, especially"

   58 y/o male with Esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning
   to the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that had developed in
   the last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Has now been extubated >24 hrs.  Improving CXR
   but with coarse central airways sounds.   He had extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which
   had covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative. BNP
   743 and echo normal, CTA negative.  S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   Extubated on [**12-18**]. Currently tachypneic and alkalemic.
   - Lasix bolus to improve UOP
   - Stopped antibiotics as he had completed a full course, afebrile.
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On [**12-16**], Neostigmine 2mg with
   0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention.
   Improved, he is now having BM
   - Aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   - Discontinued Cipro prophylaxis?
   .
   # Hypotension (corrected): wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial
   from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not
   respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely  3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - Previously on hydrocortisone 25mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, wean
   to 12.5mg q6h yesterday, change to 7.25mg yesterday
   .
   #Hct drop: s/p blood transfusion Has improved and been stable. Is
   pancytopenic.  Possible shock reaction, possibly from chemo or
   questionable primary bone marrow source.
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   .
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement. S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   - Hepaotology recommends leaving draining paracentesis site for now and
   hoping will close on own
   - Does not have history of SBP, so no cipro prophylaxis for now.
   - Lactulose for liver disease and bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure that developed over the last 12 hours. The patient had extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan, suggestive of atypical pneumonia or ARDS, which were covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro. The patient's rheumatoid factor and cryocrit were checked for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from cryoglobulinemia, but both were negative. The patient's BNP was 743 and echo was normal, and CTA was negative.

The patient was extubated on [**12-18**] but became tachypneic and alkalemic. Lasix bolus was given to improve urine output, antibiotics were stopped as the patient had completed a full course and was afebrile, and nebulizers and Mucinex were given as needed.

The patient's abdomen is distended, but not tense. A CT scan confirmed no anatomic obstruction, indicating the patient has [**Last Name (un) 5975**] syndrome. The colon was decompressed through colonoscopy by GI, but the patient's KUB improved and then worsened again.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o male with Esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning
   to the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that had developed in
   the last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Has now been extubated >24 hrs.  Improving CXR
   but with coarse central airways sounds.   He had extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which
   had covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative. BNP
   743 and echo normal, CTA negative.  S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   Extubated on [**12-18**]. Currently tachypneic and alkalemic.
   - Lasix bolus to improve UOP
   - Stopped antibiotics as he had completed a full course, afebrile.
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On [**12-16**], Neostigmine 2mg with
   0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention.
   Improved, he is now having BM
   - Aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose
   - Discontinued Cipro prophylaxis?
   .
   # Hypotension (corrected): wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial
   from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not
   respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely  3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - Previously on hydrocortisone 25mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, wean
   to 12.5mg q6h yesterday, change to 7.25mg yesterday
   .
   #Hct drop: s/p blood transfusion Has improved and been stable. Is
   pancytopenic.  Possible shock reaction, possibly from chemo or
   questionable primary bone marrow source.
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   .
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement. S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   - Hepaotology recommends leaving draining paracentesis site for now and
   hoping will close on own
   - Does not have history of SBP, so no cipro prophylaxis for now.
   - Lactulose for liver disease and bowel regimen
   .
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.
   - Esophageal cancer not involved per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**].
   .
   #Access: L IJ, A line (to be pulled if correlates with VBG), chemo port
   and PIV.
   #FEN: replete electrolytes PRN, Nutren pulmonary tube feeds, (patient
   without gag reflex)
   #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, heparin TID, type and screen; lactulose for
   bowel regimen

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure that developed over the last 12 hours. The patient had extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which were covered with Vancomycin/Meropenem/Cipro. These medications were stopped as the patient had completed a full course and was afebrile.

The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, abdominal distension, hypotension, anemia, anasarca/liver disease, and esophageal cancer. The respiratory failure is improving, with an improving chest X-ray but coarse central airway sounds. The abdominal distension is due to colonoscopic decompression, as the patient has Ogilvie's syndrome (acute colonic pseudo-obstruction). The hypotension is multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease. The patient has been weaned off steroids and is currently on hydrocortisone 7.25mg q6h for adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's Hct dropped after a blood transfusion, possibly due to a shock reaction or primary bone marrow source. He is pancytopenic and requires transfusion for Hct <21. The anasarca/liver disease is most likely due to liver disease, although cardiac involvement cannot"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old man with cirrhosis who was admitted with shock and respiratory failure. He experienced some desaturation overnight requiring suctioning. The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, famotidine, heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and others.

The vital signs of the patient are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
- Heart rate: 86 bpm (normal range: 70-103 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 117/79 mmHg (normal range: 88-146/40-97 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-25 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,554 mL, with outputs including 386 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 588 mL through intravenous fluids, 1,165 mL through urine, 300 mL through the nasogastric tube, 425 mL through stool, and 75 mL through drains. The overall fluid balance is -1,501 mL.

Respiratory support is being provided through an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, with a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with the patient appearing thin. Eyes and conjunctiva are PERRL, cardiovascular examination is normal, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory chest examination shows rhonchorous breath sounds, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. Extremities show 2+ edema in both lower extremities, and neurologic examination is attentive and follows simple commands.

Lab results include a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, white blood cell count of 21 K/uL, platelet count of 187 mg/dL, sodium level of 148 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and liver enzymes within normal range. Other lab values are also provided in the note.

The assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), constipation, pleural disease, pain control, ascites, and ICU care. The patient is overall improved but very weak, with ongoing respiratory failure and cirrhosis. Further diuresis is being held, and a PT consult has been requested."

   [**12-18**] paracentesis shows PMN
   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o male with Esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning
   to the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that had developed in
   the last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Has now been extubated >24 hrs.  Improving CXR
   but with coarse central airways sounds.   He had extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which
   had covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative. BNP
   743 and echo normal, CTA negative.  S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   Extubated on [**12-18**]. Currently tachypneic and alkalemic.
   - 20 mg IV lasix this morning and this afternoon; check PM lytes
   - Stopped antibiotics as he had completed a full course, afebrile.
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   #Altered mental status: likely due to prolonged course of intubation
   and sedation as well as sepsis and ARDS.  Hepatic encephalopathy
   contributing.  Is improving slowly.
   - hep recs: rifaximin 400TID, increase lactulose to 3-6BM, free water
   for hypernatremia, diuresis (wrote for lasix 20)
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On [**12-16**], Neostigmine 2mg with
   0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention.
   Improved, he is now having BM
   - Aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose (goal of [**3-31**]/day)
   - Discontinued Cipro prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypotension (corrected): wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial
   from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not
   respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely  3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - On standing dose pf prednisone 10mg prednisone
   .
   #Hct drop: s/p blood transfusion Has improved and been stable. Is
   pancytopenic.  Possible shock reaction, possibly from chemo or
   questionable primary bone marrow source.
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   .
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement. S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   - Hepaotology recommends leaving draining paracentesis site for now and
   hoping will close on own
   - hep recs: rifaximin 400TID, increase lactulose to 3-6BM, free water
   for hypernatremia, diuresis (wrote for lasix 20)
   - Does not have history of SBP, so no cipro prophylaxis for now.
   .
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.
   - Esophageal cancer not involved per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**].
   .
   # Tachycardia:
   - EKG today
   .
   #Access: L IJ, A line (to be pulled if correlates with VBG), chemo port
   and PIV.
   #FEN: replete electrolytes PRN, Nutren pulmonary tube feeds, (patient
   without gag reflex)
   #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, heparin TID, type and screen; lactulose for
   bowel regimen

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and extensive ground-glass opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia or ARDS. The patient has been treated with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro antibiotics, but they were stopped as he had completed a full course and was afebrile.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient had hypoxic respiratory failure and was extubated >24 hours ago. He is improving, but still tachypneic and alkalemic. Nebulizers and Mucinex are being given as needed.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing this due to prolonged intubation and sedation, as well as sepsis and ARDS. Hepatic encephalopathy is also contributing to his altered mental status. He is improving slowly.

3. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdomen is distended, but not tense. A CT scan confirmed no anatomic obstruction, indicating he has small bowel obstruction syndrome. His colon was decompressed colonoscopically by GI, and he is now having bowel movements.

4. Hypotension (corrected): The patient's hypotension is multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency,"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o male with Esophageal CA in remission and hepatitis C returning
   to the ICU with new hypoxic respiratory failure that had developed in
   the last 12 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Has now been extubated >24 hrs.  Improving CXR
   but with coarse central airways sounds.   He had extensive ground-glass
   opacities on CT scan suggestive of atypical pneumonia vs ARDS, which
   had covered with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro.  Flu negative. Checked
   rheumatoid factor and cryocrit for possible pulmonary hemorrhage from
   cryoglobulinemia given history of Hep C. These were both negative. BNP
   743 and echo normal, CTA negative.  S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   Extubated on [**12-18**]. Currently tachypneic and alkalemic.
   - 20 mg IV lasix this morning and this afternoon; check PM lytes
   - Stopped antibiotics as he had completed a full course, afebrile.
   - Continue nebulizers and Mucinex PRN.
   - Treat abdominal issues as below
   .
   #Altered mental status: likely due to prolonged course of intubation
   and sedation as well as sepsis and ARDS.  Hepatic encephalopathy
   contributing.  Is improving slowly.
   - hep recs: rifaximin 400TID, increase lactulose to 3-6BM, free water
   for hypernatremia, diuresis (wrote for lasix 20)
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Patient
s abdomen is distended though not
   tense.  CT scan w/ contrast confirmed no anatomic obstruction, meaning
   that he has [**Last Name (un) 5975**]
s syndrome.  Decompressed colonoscopically by GI.
   KUB improved, but then worsened again.  On [**12-16**], Neostigmine 2mg with
   0.04glycopyrrolate given with no large BM or change in distention.
   Improved, he is now having BM
   - Aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose (goal of [**3-31**]/day)
   - Discontinued Cipro prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypotension (corrected): wean steroids.   Hypotension multifactorial
   from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and liver disease.  He did not
   respond to a cortisol stim test [**12-8**], so we are giving fluticasone and
   hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.  He does have likely  3rd
   spacing in the setting of malnutrition, liver disease, and cancer.
   Weaned steroids.
   - Previously on hydrocortisone 25mg q6 for adrenal insufficiency, wean
   to 12.5mg q6h yesterday, change to 7.25mg yesterday
   .
   #Hct drop: s/p blood transfusion Has improved and been stable. Is
   pancytopenic.  Possible shock reaction, possibly from chemo or
   questionable primary bone marrow source.
   - Transfuse for Hct <21
   .
   #: Anasarca/ Liver disease: Most likely d/t liver disease, although
   cannot r/o some cardiac involvement. S/p paracentesis on [**12-17**].
   - Hepaotology recommends leaving draining paracentesis site for now and
   hoping will close on own
   - hep recs: rifaximin 400TID, increase lactulose to 3-6BM, free water
   for hypernatremia, diuresis (wrote for lasix 20)
   - Does not have history of SBP, so no cipro prophylaxis for now.
   .
   #: Esophageal CA: thought to be definitively treated with cisplatin and
   5-FU.
   - Esophageal cancer not involved per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1932**].

   # Tachycardia:
   - EKG today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer in remission and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with new-onset hypoxic respiratory failure, which developed over the last 12 hours. The patient had extensive ground-glass opacities on a CT scan, suggestive of atypical pneumonia or ARDS. He was initially treated with Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro, but these antibiotics were stopped as the patient had completed a full course and was afebrile.

The patient also presented with altered mental status, likely due to prolonged intubation and sedation, as well as sepsis and ARDS. Hepatic encephalopathy may be contributing to his altered mental status. His hepatic recommendations include rifaximin 400 TID, increasing lactulose to 3-6 BM, free water for hypernatremia, and diuresis.

The patient had abdominal distension, which was confirmed by a CT scan without anatomic obstruction. He has been diagnosed with [Last Name (un)] syndrome and underwent colonoscopic decompression. His KUB improved but then worsened again. Neostigmine with glycopyrrolate was given without significant bowel movement or change in distention. The patient is now on an aggressive bowel regimen with lactulose.

The patient's hypotension is multifactorial from sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and liver disease"
