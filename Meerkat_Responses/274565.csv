   Assessment and Plan
   44 y M with h/o developmental delay, obesity who presents with fevers,
   cough, and possible food impaction.
   .
   #) Food impaction - s/p EGD that revealed food in above 14 mm
   esophageal stricture. Does have predisposition for food impaction
   including h/o GE junction stricture, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia.
   Per GI, esophagel stricture does not require further intervention.
   - Educate pt regarding chewing food carefully and cutting food into
   small pieces before swallowing.
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis - WBC elevated to 15.1 without bandemia. No fevers
   while in ICU.  With retrocardiac opacity on CXR, concern for CAP vs
   aspiration PNA, vs aspiration pneumonitis.   Pt denies any
   symptomatology of GI infection or UTI.  He did have several episodes of
   emesis prior to admission, however this was likely caused by food
   impaction as  he has not had any further episodes. Lactate not
   elevated, pressures stable.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl for likely aspiration PNA.
   - UA pending
   - Trend fever curve, tylenol prn.
   - f/u blood cxs, sputum cxs
   .
   #) Hypoxia - Likely secondary to possible aspiration PNA. Pt also
   diffusely wheezy and rhonchorus post EGD.   Pt tends to desat while
   sleeping and may have a component of OSA.  Currently on 6 L NC.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Treating for likely aspiration PNA as above.
   - Nebs prn
   .
   #) ARF
 Creatinine improved with 1L bolus fluids o/n. Likely due to
   prerenal etiology given innumberable episodes of emesis prior to
   admission. s/p 1 L IVFs in ED.
   - Trend BUN, Cr.
   - Bolus 1 L NS
   .
   #) Tachycardia - Likely [**12-29**] dehydration, anxiety, pain s/p procedure.
   TSH 7.7.
   - IVFs as above.
   - Monitor on telemetry overnight.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism
 Elevated TSH, consider decreasing levothyroxine on
   dc.
   .
   #Transaminitis: elevated at baseline.  Suspect medication-related.
   Will follow.
   .
   #) Bipolar disorder - Continue depakote, zyprexa, SSRI. Per group home,
   pt can become very aggressive and assaultive and often has verbal
   outbursts. Group home to provide 1:1 sitter overnight.  If patient
   needs additional supervision during the day the group home should be
   contact[**Name (NI) **] as they may be able to provide a daytime staff member as
   well.
   .
   #) Esophagitis - Continue PPI. No active signs of esophagitis on EGD.
   .
   #) Crohn's disease - Not active. Continue asacol.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of developmental delay, obesity, and various medical conditions including hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, Crohn's disease, and esophageal stricture. The patient presents with symptoms of hypoxia, food impaction, cough, and fevers. 

The patient underwent an endoscopy that revealed food impaction in an esophageal stricture measuring 14 mm. The patient has a predisposition for food impaction due to a history of gastroesophageal junction stricture, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia. It was determined that the esophageal stricture does not require further intervention, and the patient was educated on proper chewing techniques and cutting food into small pieces before swallowing. The patient will continue taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The patient also has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.1, but without bandemia. There are concerns for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration pneumonia (AP), or aspiration pneumonitis due to the retrocardiac opacity seen on chest X-ray. The patient denies any gastrointestinal infection or urinary tract infection symptoms, but has had episodes of emesis prior to admission. The patient's lactate levels are not elevated, and pressures are stable. Levofloxacin and Flagyl are being continued for likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient's blood cultures and sputum cultures are pending."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of developmental delay, obesity, and several medical conditions including bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, esophageal stricture, hiatal hernia, Crohn's disease, and possibly food impaction. He presented to the ICU with fevers, cough, and possible food impaction. The patient underwent an endoscopy which revealed food in an esophageal stricture. He also had nasal and urine cultures taken. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and mildly elevated liver function tests. He is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and other medications. Potential medical complications include aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hypoxia, and dehydration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray raise concerns for aspiration pneumonia. He is already receiving appropriate treatment with antibiotics and probiotics.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress may indicate acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and treatment with nebulizers as needed are recommended.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest a possible pre-renal cause of acute kidney injury. Fluid resuscitation with IV fluids has already"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of developmental delay, obesity, and several medical conditions including bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, esophagitis, Crohn's disease, and food impaction. He presents with fevers, cough, and possible food impaction.

The patient underwent an endoscopy which revealed food in an esophageal stricture. It was determined that the stricture does not require further intervention, but the patient should be educated on carefully chewing food and cutting it into small pieces before swallowing. He should continue taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The patient also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1, but without bandemia. There is a concern for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration pneumonia (PNA), or aspiration pneumonitis due to the retrocardiac opacity seen on the chest X-ray. The patient denies any symptoms of gastrointestinal infection or urinary tract infection, but he did have several episodes of emesis prior to admission. Levofloxacin and Flagyl have been continued for likely aspiration PNA, and follow-up blood cultures, sputum culture, and lactate levels are being monitored.

The patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely secondary to possible aspiration PNA. He is also wheezy and rhonchorus post endoscopy. Oxygen therapy will be weaned as tolerated, and nebulizers will be used as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with developmental delay, esophageal stricture, and several medical conditions including food impaction, pneumonia, hypoxemia, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, and Crohn's disease. He was admitted with food impaction and pneumonia. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed to move the food into his stomach, and he is being continued on proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The pneumonia is believed to be aspiration-related due to the esophageal food impaction. Antimicrobials and MDIs are being continued to treat the pneumonia. The hypoxemia is attributed to the pneumonia, and supplemental oxygen is being administered to maintain SaO2 > 90%. The patient's nausea/vomiting has improved and is now attributed to the food impaction. Acute renal failure is suspected to be pre-renal and the patient is being hydrated with intravenous fluids (IVF). An elevation in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level suggests hypothyroidism, and free T4 will be checked. The patient's bipolar disorder and Crohn's disease are being managed with their respective medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has hypoxemia due to pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory distress and further respiratory complications if not managed properly.
2. Gastrointestinal Complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of developmental delay, obesity, presenting with fevers, cough, and possible food impaction. The patient has a predisposition for food impaction due to a history of esophageal stricture, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia. The patient's esophageal stricture does not require further intervention. The patient is advised to chew food carefully and cut it into small pieces before swallowing. The patient is already on PPI (proton pump inhibitor) for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The patient's WBC (white blood cell) count is elevated at 15.1, indicating leukocytosis. The patient has retrocardiac opacity on CXR (chest X-ray), which raises concern for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration pneumonia (AP), or aspiration pneumonitis. The patient denies any symptoms of gastrointestinal infection or urinary tract infection. The patient had several episodes of emesis prior to admission, but this was likely caused by food impaction as there have been no further episodes. Lactate levels are not elevated, and pressures are stable.

The patient is being treated with levofloxacin and flagyl for likely aspiration PNA (pneumonia). The patient's urine analysis (UA) is pending, and a trend fever curve is being monitored. Blood cultures and sputum cultures are also pending.

The patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which can be caused by possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA). This may be due to the patient's history of developmental delay, obesity, and previous esophageal issues such as food impaction, esophageal stricture, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia. The patient's desaturation while sleeping and wheezing/rhonchi after an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) also suggest possible obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or respiratory compromise.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, indicating a possible infection. However, the lack of fevers and absence of bandemia suggest a non-severe infection. The presence of retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray raises concerns for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration PNA, or aspiration pneumonitis. Since the patient denies symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) infection or urinary tract infection (UTI), it is important to continue antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin and flagyl for likely aspiration PNA. A urinalysis (UA) is pending, and follow-up blood cultures and sputum cultures should be obtained.

3. Acute respiratory failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels improved after receiving a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia caused by food impaction and underlying esophageal issues such as a stricture and hiatal hernia. 

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of hypoxia, leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count), and consolidation on chest X-ray suggest aspiration pneumonia. Treatment includes antibiotics, pulmonary support, and encouraging respiratory exercises.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels were initially elevated but improved after receiving intravenous fluids. ARF may be caused by prerenal factors, such as dehydration from episodes of emesis.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has an elevated TSH level, indicating possible hypothyroidism. The plan is to consider increasing levothyroxine upon discharge.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be medication-related. Further monitoring and evaluation are necessary.

6. Bipolar Disorder: The patient requires ongoing medication management for bipolar disorder, including depakote, zyprexa, and an SSRI. Additional supervision is needed due to aggressive and assaultive behavior.

7. Esophagitis and Esophageal Stricture: The patient has esophageal issues including esophagitis"

 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 HYPOXEMIA
   44 y M with h/o developmental delay, obesity who presents with fevers,
   cough, and possible food impaction.
   .
   #) Food impaction - s/p EGD that revealed food in above 14 mm
   esophageal stricture. Does have predisposition for food impaction
   including h/o GE junction stricture, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia.
   Per GI, esophagel stricture does not require further intervention.
   - Educate pt regarding chewing food carefully and cutting food into
   small pieces before swallowing.
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis - WBC elevated to 15.1 without bandemia. No fevers
   while in ICU.  With retrocardiac opacity on CXR, concern for CAP vs
   aspiration PNA, vs aspiration pneumonitis.   Pt denies any
   symptomatology of GI infection or UTI.  He did have several episodes of
   emesis prior to admission, however this was likely caused by food
   impaction as  he has not had any further episodes. Lactate not
   elevated, pressures stable.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl for likely aspiration PNA.
   - UA pending
   - Trend fever curve, tylenol prn.
   - f/u blood cxs, sputum cxs
   .
   #) Hypoxia - Likely secondary to possible aspiration PNA. Pt also
   diffusely wheezy and rhonchorus post EGD.   Pt tends to desat while
   sleeping and may have a component of OSA.  Currently on 6 L NC.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Treating for likely aspiration PNA as above.
   - Nebs prn
   .
   #) ARF
 Creatinine improved with 1L bolus fluids o/n. Likely due to
   prerenal etiology given innumberable episodes of emesis prior to
   admission. s/p 1 L IVFs in ED.
   - Trend BUN, Cr.
   - Bolus 1 L NS
   .
   #) Tachycardia - Likely [**12-29**] dehydration, anxiety, pain s/p procedure.
   TSH 7.7.
   - IVFs as above.
   - Monitor on telemetry overnight.
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism
 Elevated TSH, consider decreasing levothyroxine on
   dc.
   .
   #Transaminitis: elevated at baseline.  Suspect medication-related.
   Will follow.
   .
   #) Bipolar disorder - Continue depakote, zyprexa, SSRI. Per group home,
   pt can become very aggressive and assaultive and often has verbal
   outbursts. Group home to provide 1:1 sitter overnight.  If patient
   needs additional supervision during the day the group home should be
   contact[**Name (NI) **] as they may be able to provide a daytime staff member as
   well.
   .
   #) Esophagitis - Continue PPI. No active signs of esophagitis on EGD.
   .
   #) Crohn's disease - Not active. Continue asacol.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications. These include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a problem with oxygen supply in the body. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or underlying sleep apnea.

2. Food impaction: The patient has a history of esophageal strictures, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia, which increases the risk of food impaction. An endoscopic evaluation showed food in an above 14 mm esophageal stricture.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an infection. However, there are no fevers present, and the patient denies any symptoms of gastrointestinal infection or urinary tract infection. The concern is for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonitis.

4. Acute respiratory failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels improved after receiving a 1L bolus of fluids overnight, indicating a possible prerenal etiology. The patient had multiple episodes of emesis prior to admission.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to dehydration, anxiety, pain after a procedure, or other factors. The TSH level is also elevated, suggesting hypothyroidism.

6. Bipolar disorder: The patient requires ongoing treatment for bipolar disorder, including medications such as depakote, zyprexa,"

   FOOD IMPACTION -- Esophogeal stricture.   s/p EGD with movement of food
   into stomach.  No further intervention.  Continue PPI.  Need to
   determine whether requires dilitation of stricture prior to discharge
   --> check with GI service.
   PNEUMONIA -- likely aspiration in context of esophogeal food
   impaction.  Continue antimicrobials, MDIs.  Encourage cough.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to pneumonia.  Continue supplimental oxygen,
   maintain SaO2 > 90%.  Monitor closely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of developmental delay, esophageal stricture, pneumonia, and multiple medical conditions including bipolar disorder, Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, and possible acute renal failure. He presented with food impaction and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, nausea, vomiting, and anemia. He is currently on supplemental oxygen, antimicrobials, MDIs, PPI, and other medications for his various conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, but there are signs of respiratory distress and possible aspiration pneumonia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal thyroid function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of esophageal stricture and food impaction increases the risk of aspiration, leading to pneumonia. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient may have pre-renal acute renal failure due to dehydration or hypotension. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload if not promptly treated.
3. Hypothyroidism: The elevated TSH level indicates possible hypothyroidism. If left untreated, this condition can lead to further decline in the patient's overall health and metabolic status.
4. Anemia: The decreasing hemoglobin levels suggest anemia, which can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. The underlying cause of anemia needs to be investigated and managed appropriately.
5. Bipolar Disorder and Crohn's Disease: Although these conditions are not directly life-threatening, they require ongoing management to prevent exacerbations and optimize the patient's quality of life.
6. Possible Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizures related to clozapine use. It is important to monitor for any signs of seizure activity and ensure proper seizure management.
7. Potential Adverse Drug Reactions: Given the patient's multiple medications, there is a possibility of adverse drug reactions or drug interactions. Regular monitoring and medication review are necessary to minimize these risks.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory status, renal function, thyroid function, anemia, and psychiatric conditions. Prompt intervention is crucial to prevent further complications and improve the patient's outcome."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of developmental delay, obesity, and several medical conditions including bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, Crohn's disease, and a history of gastrointestinal issues such as esophageal stricture, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia.
- The patient presented with fevers, cough, and possible food impaction, which led to the discovery of a 14 mm esophageal stricture.
- The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia due to the recent episode of food impaction and is currently being treated with antibiotics and supportive care.
- The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) that improved with IV fluids and is believed to be caused by prerenal etiology due to episodes of emesis prior to admission.
- Other issues include transaminitis, which is suspected to be medication-related, and elevated TSH levels indicating hypothyroidism.
- The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and requires ongoing psychiatric medication management.
- The patient's esophagitis appears to be inactive, and he is already on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
- The patient has Crohn's disease, which is currently not active, and is being managed with Asacol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of developmental delay, obesity, and several medical conditions including hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, Crohn's disease, and a history of esophageal stricture. The patient presented with respiratory distress and something stuck in his throat. He was found to have an elevated temperature, cough, and possible food impaction. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were stable on 6.5 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. 

Assessment and Plan:
1) Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of hypoxia, leukocytosis, and consolidation on chest X-ray suggest aspiration pneumonia following an episode of food impaction. His pulmonary status is improving with decreasing oxygen requirements.
2) Food Impaction: The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed food in an esophageal stricture. He has a predisposition for food impaction due to a history of gastroesophageal junction stricture, esophagitis, and hiatal hernia. The esophageal stricture does not require further intervention, and the patient is able to tolerate regular diet. Education regarding careful chewing and cutting food into small pieces before swallowing is advised.
3) Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are improving, likely due to a prerenal etiology from multiple episodes of emesis prior to admission. Trending BUN"

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with developmental delay, esophageal stricture, and pneumonia. The patient was admitted with food impaction and pneumonia. The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Food impaction: The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to move the food into the stomach. No further intervention is required. The patient should continue taking proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication. It is recommended to check with the gastroenterology service whether the patient requires dilation of the stricture prior to discharge.

2. Pneumonia: The patient likely aspirated food due to esophageal stricture, leading to pneumonia. The patient should continue antimicrobials and MDIs (presumably means ""medication devices"" or ""medical inhalers""). The patient's cough should be encouraged.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels are attributed to pneumonia. The patient's supplemental oxygen should be continued, aiming to maintain SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) above 90%. The patient's condition should be closely monitored.

4. Nausea/vomiting: The patient initially experienced nausea and vomiting due to food impaction, but these symptoms have now improved. It is believed that severe coughing may have contributed to the vomiting. 

5. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has pre-renal acute renal failure. Hydration should be improved.

6. Anemia: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of developmental delay, esophageal stricture, and multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, hypoxemia, nausea/vomiting, acute renal failure, anemia, hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, and Crohn's disease. The patient was admitted with food impaction and pneumonia. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to move the food impaction into the stomach. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 140/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. Physical examination findings include normal pupils, no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus, normocephalic head, no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with no wheezes or crackles, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities, and no skin rash or jaundice. The patient is neurologically attentive and follows simple commands.
