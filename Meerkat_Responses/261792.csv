   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna and progressive respiratory failure
    >Hypox Respiratory failure:  most likely multifocal PNA on a back drop
   of cirrhosis and obesity with low lung voumes.  The differential for
   her PNA includes CAP including legionella given the GI symptoms  as
   well as aspiration in the setting of odontogenic infection, an
   considering the patient is an immunocomprimised host (AZA) atypical
   infections (pneumocystis, virals, and [**Last Name (un) 9201**] pathogens). This latter
   possibility is especially concering in light of her clinical worsening
   on traditional CAP abx.  Finally the ID consultants raise the
   possibility of
   rodent pathogens and pathogens sucha as tularemia endemic to MVY.  In
   terms of support for her hypoxemic respiratory failure will Abx as
   below and supportive O2 with consideration of utilization of CPAP/BiPAP
   as her picture is complicated by obesity with low lung vols and
   atelectasis which further impairs her oxygenation, fialing this she
   would require intubation.
   - Cont Vancomycin, doxycycline and Gent per ID reccomendations
   - F/u clx and serologies as previously outlined.
   - Chest CT and consideration of bronchoscopy with BAL
   - Consider early use of CPAP if clinical deterioration
   - Run net negative goal -500 cc.
   >Autoimmune hepatitis
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   > Leukopenia mot likely [**12-26**]  medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
    > Tooth infection
   - dental recs
   - panorex when stabilized

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, presenting with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has a history of medication use including azathioprine, which may contribute to leukopenia. The patient is also noted to have a tooth infection and is on multiple antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. Her vital signs indicate a fever of 101.7Â°F and respiratory distress with crackles in the chest, indicating possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient's labs show leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and altered coagulation parameters.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia and aspiration.
2. Hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation like CPAP/BiPAP.
3. Progression of respiratory failure necessitating intubation.
4. Systemic infection leading to sepsis.
5. Further deterioration of liver function in the context of autoimmune hepatitis.
6. Potential development of drug-induced neutropenia due to azathioprine.
7. Complications from the tooth infection, such as worsening local infection or spread of infection.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, liver function, and white blood cell count. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics and supportive care are essential. Consideration should be given to imaging studies, such as a chest CT and bronchoscopy with BAL, to aid in diagnosis and guide management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has multifocal pneumonia (PNA) and progressive respiratory failure. The patient's large shunt fraction indicates a potential need for coverage with antibiotics such as vancomycin, doxycycline, and gentamicin, as recommended by the ID team. Additionally, she is being started on empiric treatment for pneumocystis with bactrim. Further diagnostic tests, including a chest CT and bronchoscopy with BAL, are planned. The patient is not a candidate for CPAP due to a depressed mental status. Fluid balance is being monitored, and the patient's net negative goal is -500 cc. A TTE with bubble test is also being considered to assess intra-pulmonary shunt.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypox Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing multifocal PNA on a background of cirrhosis and obesity with low lung volumes. This could be causing her hypox respiratory failure.
2. Autoimmune hepatitis: The patient has autoimmune hepatitis, which requires specific management including holding azathioprine due to cytopenia, continuing lactulose and ursodiol, and seeking recommendations from hepatology.
3. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia may be due to medication effect (e.g., azathioprine) or current infection. Close monitoring of CBC is recommended"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   .
   * Pneumonia
   Coming from home and therefore at risk for typical and atypical
   bacterial CAP pathogens eg pneumococcus, haemophilis, legionella.
   Habitation on Cape with possible rodent contacts raises the intriguing
   possibility of pulmonary tularemia -- consider also hantavirus, though
   less likely. Given cellular immunosuppression, also consider
   opportunists such as pneumocystis and [**Known lastname **]. Given her poor
   dentition consider also aspiration with oral anaerobe.
   - Continue vancomycin, agree with changing to amikacin and doxycycline
   per ID recommendations
   - Induce sputum for gram stain and culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]. Respiratory
   virus panel ordered. Check fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies. ID also recommended CMV,
   enterovirus, adenovirus PCRs along with cryptococcal and histoplasma
   antigen tests.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2^nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4^th dose
   - Consider bronchoscopy, chest CT
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Obtain OSH records regarding prior treatment
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Pt increasingly somnolent this AM. ABG shows CO2 near baseline. DDx
   includes delirium secondary to infection, ICU, or medications. Also
   consider hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   * Dyspnea
   Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm and fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - Check  TTE
   - Diurese -1L, follow daily weights, strict I/O
   .
   * Autoimmune hepatitis
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Leukopenia
   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or current
   infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   .
   * Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   .
   * Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time
   .
   * Tooth infection
   - dental recs
   - panorex when stabilized

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory distress and failure if not properly managed.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is increasingly somnolent, which could be due to infection, ICU stay, or medications. This may progress to delirium or hepatic encephalopathy if not addressed.
3. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is multifactorial, including bronchospasm, fluid overload, and pneumonia. It is crucial to treat the underlying causes, such as pneumonia, and manage fluid balance to alleviate symptoms.
4. Autoimmune hepatitis: The patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis, and her condition needs to be closely monitored. Medications such as azathioprine may need to be adjusted based on blood counts.
5. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which could be due to medication effect or infection. Regular monitoring of CBC is necessary to ensure timely intervention if neutropenia develops.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to chronic liver disease. Close monitoring of blood counts is essential.
7. Asthma: The patient has asthma"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4714] is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to infection, ICU stay, or medications. She also has dyspnea, possibly caused by pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. Other medical conditions include anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, asthma, and a tooth infection. The patient is receiving various treatments for her conditions, including antibiotics, bronchodilators, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium if not properly managed.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of autoimmune hepatitis and current symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy should be considered as a possible cause of altered mental status.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dyspnea and multifocal pneumonia increase the risk of respiratory failure if the infection worsens or if there is inadequate oxygenation.
4. Sepsis: With multiple organ dysfunction and systemic infection, the patient is at risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to further complications.
5. Pneumonia Complications: The patient's pneumonia could progress to complications such as abscess formation, empyema, or pleural eff"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with dyspnea. The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, aspirin, sulfa, ibuprofen, and ginger. The patient received antibiotics (amikacin, fluconazole, and vancomycin) between [2130-4-24] and [2130-4-25]. The patient was also given heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix), and haloperidol (Haldol).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7Â°C (101.7Â°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/35-127/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals the patient lying in bed, sleepy but arousable, with regular S1 and S2 heart sounds, left greater than right rales, a few wheezes in the lungs, an obese abdomen with non-tender bowel sounds and fluid wave, warm extremities with bilateral edema, and palpable pulses. The patient's orientation is impaired, and they do not cooperate with asterixis testing.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   .
   * Pneumonia
   Coming from home and therefore at risk for typical and atypical
   bacterial CAP pathogens eg pneumococcus, haemophilis, legionella. Did
   not respond to CAP treatment. Habitation on Cape with possible rodent
   contacts raises the intriguing possibility of pulmonary tularemia --
   consider also hantavirus, though less likely. Given cellular
   immunosuppression, also consider opportunists such as pneumocystis and
   [**Known lastname **]. Given her poor dentition consider also aspiration with oral
   anaerobe.
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - Induce sputum for gram stain and culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]. Respiratory
   virus panel ordered. Check fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies. ID also recommended CMV,
   enterovirus, adenovirus PCRs along with cryptococcal and histoplasma
   antigen tests.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2^nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4^th dose
   - start bactrim IV today empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (day 1 = [**2130-4-25**])
 will
   need to check Sulfa allergy prior to dosing
   - Consider chest CT once MS improves
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Obtain OSH records regarding prior treatment
   - attempt induced sputum today
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Pt increasingly somnolent this AM. ABG shows CO2 near baseline. DDx
   includes delirium secondary to infection, ICU, or medications. Also
   consider hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Place NGT to ensure lactulose can be given
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - d/c Celexa
   - if not improved this PM, would likely need intubation for airway
   protection
   * Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - f/u TTE with bubble for intrapulmonary shunt
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   * Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - place NGT
   - start rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Leukopenia
   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or current
   infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   .
   * Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   .
   * Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time
   .
   * Tooth infection
   - dental recs
   - panorex when stabilized

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**], a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, was transferred to the ICU for dyspnea and oxygen requirement. She presented with fever, cough, and multifocal pneumonia. She has a history of asthma and is currently experiencing altered mental status, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and dyspnea. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a fever and her respiratory rate is elevated. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient has bilateral patchy opacities on chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal blood cell counts. The patient is at risk for various infections, including typical and atypical bacterial pneumonia, opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis and CMV, and aspiration with oral anaerobes. She also has a possible tooth infection. The patient's altered mental status may be due to infection, ICU stay, or medications, and there is a concern for hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment plans include continuing antibiotics, inducing sputum for gram stain and culture, checking fungal antigens, and obtaining respiratory virus panel. The patient is also being considered for a chest CT once she improves, and further tests are pending to rule out specific infections. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and potential complications include pneumonia, delirium, fluid overload, pulmonary embolism"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multifocal pneumonia. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, sulfa, ibuprofen, and ginger. The patient is autodiuresing, with negative fluid balance of 895 mL since 12 AM. The patient's blood pressure is low at 97/55 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 2.2 K/uL, and liver enzymes are elevated as well. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 97/55 mmHg, which may indicate potential hypotension. This could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Oxygenation issues: The patient's oxygen saturation is 93%, indicating potential difficulties in oxygenating the blood. This could result in hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
3. Infection: The patient has multifocal pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) indicate potential liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and assess the impact on the patient's overall health.
5. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   .
   * Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
   - Negative respiratory panel
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - ID also recommended CMV, enterovirus, adenovirus PCRs along with
   cryptococcal and histoplasma antigen tests.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2^nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4^th dose, erroneous through obtained at
   3am, true trough pending from 9 am
   - Continue bactrim IV  for empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (day 1 = [**2130-4-25**])
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - attempt expectorated sputum today
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Improved now with lactulose and likely improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Continue Celexa
   - Monitor for airway protection
   * Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - TTE with bubble negative for intrapulmonary shunt
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   * Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - place NGT
   - start rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Leukopenia
   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or current
   infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   .
   * Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   .
   * Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time
   .
   * Tooth infection
   - dental recs
   - panorex when stabilized

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   .
   * Pneumonia
   Coming from home and therefore at risk for typical and atypical
   bacterial CAP pathogens eg pneumococcus, haemophilis, legionella. Did
   not respond to CAP treatment. Habitation on Cape with possible rodent
   contacts raises the intriguing possibility of pulmonary tularemia --
   consider also hantavirus, though less likely. Given cellular
   immunosuppression, also consider opportunists such as pneumocystis and
   [**Known lastname **]. Given her poor dentition consider also aspiration with oral
   anaerobe.
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - Induce sputum for gram stain and culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]. Respiratory
   virus panel ordered. Check fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies. ID also recommended CMV,
   enterovirus, adenovirus PCRs along with cryptococcal and histoplasma
   antigen tests.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2^nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4^th dose
   - start bactrim IV today empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (day 1 = [**2130-4-25**])
 will
   need to check Sulfa allergy prior to dosing
   - Consider chest CT once MS improves
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Obtain OSH records regarding prior treatment
   - attempt induced sputum today
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Pt increasingly somnolent this AM. ABG shows CO2 near baseline. DDx
   includes delirium secondary to infection, ICU, or medications. Also
   consider hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Place NGT to ensure lactulose can be given
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - d/c Celexa
   - if not improved this PM, would likely need intubation for airway
   protection
   * Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - f/u TTE with bubble for intrapulmonary shunt
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   * Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - place NGT
   - start rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Leukopenia
   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or current
   infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   .
   * Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   .
   * Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time
   .
   * Tooth infection
   - dental recs
   - panorex when stabilized

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4714], a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, is currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia. The patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis and poor dentition, which raises concerns for aspiration with oral anaerobes. She also has leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthma, and a tooth infection. The patient's mental status is altered, and she is increasingly somnolent. Her dyspnea is multifactorial, likely due to multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. Her autoimmune hepatitis has now likely progressed to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is at risk for typical and atypical bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pathogens, as well as opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis and [Known Lastname]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's multifocal pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for intubation.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's autoimmune hepatitis and altered mental status, hepatic encephalopathy could progress, resulting in further deterioration of mental function.
3. Aspiration: The patient's poor dentition increases the risk of aspiration with oral anaerobes, which can lead to lung abscesses or pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, presenting with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and is experiencing progressive respiratory failure. The patient also has a large shunt fraction, cirrhosis, and obesity with low lung volumes. She is hypoxic and requires respiratory support.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypox Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to multifocal pneumonia on a background of cirrhosis and obesity with low lung volumes.
2. Autoimmune Hepatitis: The patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis and is currently experiencing confusion and agitation, which may be related to hepatic encephalopathy. She is also leukopenic and has cytopenia possibly due to medication effect (azathioprine) or current infection.
3. Tooth Infection: The patient has a tooth infection that requires dental recommendations and possibly a panorex when she is stabilized.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count may be due to medication effect (azathioprine) or current infection. Daily follow-up of the CBC is recommended.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and agitation could be worsening underlying hepatic encephalopathy. Measures such as increasing lactulose and using haloperidol sparingly should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia (PNA). She is experiencing respiratory failure and has low lung volumes. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis and obesity. She is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypox respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying conditions, such as cirrhosis and obesity, which can contribute to low lung volumes.
2. Multifocal PNA: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which can progress and lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Autoimmune hepatitis: The patient's autoimmune hepatitis may flare up or require adjustments in medication due to her current critical condition.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia may be caused by medication effect (azathioprine) or current infection. If it worsens, it may increase the risk of infections.
5. Confusion/Agitation: The patient experienced confusion and agitation, which have now resolved. However, these symptoms may recur if there are changes in her mental status.
6. Tooth infection: The patient has a tooth infection that requires dental evaluation and treatment.
7. Code status: The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) / do-not-intubate (DNI) code status, indicating that she does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation if her"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   .
   * Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
   - Negative respiratory panel
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - ID also recommended CMV, enterovirus, adenovirus PCRs along with
   cryptococcal and histoplasma antigen tests.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2^nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4^th dose, erroneous through obtained at
   3am, true trough pending from 9 am
   - Continue bactrim IV  for empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (day 1 = [**2130-4-25**])
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - attempt expectorated sputum today
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Improved now with lactulose and likely improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Continue Celexa
   - Monitor for airway protection
   * Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - TTE with bubble negative for intrapulmonary shunt
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   * Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - place NGT
   - start rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Leukopenia
   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or current
   infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   .
   * Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   .
   * Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time
   .
   * Tooth infection
   - dental recs
   - panorex when stabilized

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who is currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia. The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Other conditions include asthma, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and a tooth infection. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals as recommended by the ID team. She is also being treated for suspected PCP pneumonia and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining strict infection control measures and ensuring proper ventilation techniques.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood clots in the lower extremities. The patient should be monitored for signs of DVT, and prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or subcutaneous heparin may be necessary.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at increased risk for stress ulcers, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient should be monitored for any signs of bleeding, and prophylactic measures such as H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   .
   * Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease
   - Continue antibioitics per ID
   - appreciate ID input, at this point, would not pursue bronch  as would
   need to be intubated
   - induced sputum today
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], Pending studies include fungal
   antigens, legionella urinary antigen, tularemia and hantavirus
   serologies
   - Continue bactrim IV  for empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (day 1 = [**2130-4-25**])
   2^nd sputum induced negative, will d/c PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
   .
   * Altered mental status: Improved now with lactulose and likely
   improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue Celexa
   - Monitor for airway protection
   * Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload\
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc to even
   - start lasix 40 mg po daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, presenting with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and is currently admitted to the ICU. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 98/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and possible sepsis. Continuing appropriate antibiotics is crucial.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of 1,870 mL input and only 1,935 mL output, indicating potential fluid overload. This could lead to pulmonary edema or heart failure.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, which may be due to medication effect or current infection. Monitoring the CBC daily is important.
5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   * Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
   - Negative respiratory panel
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - ID also recommended CMV, enterovirus, adenovirus PCRs along with
   cryptococcal and histoplasma antigen tests.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4th dose, erroneous through obtained at
   3am, true trough pending from 9 am
   - Continue bactrim IV  for empiric PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (day 1 = [**2130-4-25**])
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - attempt expectorated sputum today
   .
   * Altered mental status Improved now with lactulose and likely
   improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Continue Celexa
   - Monitor for airway protection
   * Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - TTE with bubble negative for intrapulmonary shunt
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   * Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - place NGT
   - start rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Leukopenia
   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or current
   infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   * Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   * Asthma
   - Continue inhalers

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and is receiving treatment with vancomycin, amikacin, and doxycycline as per ID recommendations. The patient's altered mental status has improved with lactulose, and she is also being treated for infection and encephalopathy. She is experiencing dyspnea, which is likely multifactorial due to multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. The patient also has autoimmune hepatitis with likely hepatic encephalopathy, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and asthma. Her current vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F), heart rate 87 bpm, blood pressure 98/44 mmHg, respiratory rate 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, heparin sodium, and proton pump inhibitors. She is tolerating oral intake and has a negative respiratory panel. Additional studies are pending, including fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen, tularemia, and hantavirus serologies. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently in the ICU.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is multifocal pneumonia and fever, cough, and dyspnea. The patient also has a history of autoimmune hepatitis. 

The patient is currently receiving various treatments for their conditions, including antibiotics (vancomycin, amikacin, and doxycycline) for the pneumonia, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, bronchodilators for dyspnea, and other medications for autoimmune hepatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is critically ill with multifocal pneumonia, which indicates a severe infection. There is a risk of further infections due to immunosuppression from medication or the autoimmune disease.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's autoimmune hepatitis has led to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease. Monitoring and treatment with lactulose are ongoing.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to medication effects, infection, or chronic liver disease. Close monitoring of the CBC is recommended.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has dyspnea, which could be due to fluid overload. This needs to be managed carefully to avoid respiratory complications.
5. Airway protection: The patient's altered mental status may necessitate airway protection to prevent aspiration pneumonia.

   CXR [**4-27**]: multifocal PNA
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   * Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
   - Negative respiratory panel
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - ID also recommended CMV, enterovirus, adenovirus PCRs along with
   cryptococcal and histoplasma antigen tests.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4th dose, erroneous through obtained at
   3am, true trough pending from 9 am
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on induced sputum.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - attempt expectorated sputum today (last sample poor quality)
   * Altered mental status Improved now with lactulose and likely
   improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Continue Celexa
   - Monitor for airway protection
   * Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   * Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - place NGT
   - start rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   > Leukopenia: slowly improving
   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or current
   infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who is currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires intensive care management.

From the note, it is evident that the patient has several medical complications that need attention. These include:

1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which is indicated by her symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea. The chest X-ray confirms the presence of diffuse disease. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin, amikacin, and doxycycline as recommended by the Infectious Disease (ID) team. Further investigations such as sputum culture, PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), and other respiratory panel tests are pending. Additional studies like fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen, tularemia, and hantavirus serologies are also being considered.

2. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which has improved with lactulose administration. This could be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, especially considering her autoimmune hepatitis. The plan includes limiting sedating medications, reorienting the patient frequently, continuing lactulose, and treating the underlying infection.

3. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely multifactor"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4714], a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, is admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She presents with multifocal pneumonia, altered mental status, dyspnea, autoimmune hepatitis, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and asthma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Ms. [Known Lastname 4714] has likely developed hepatic encephalopathy due to her autoimmune hepatitis. Symptoms may include altered mental status, confusion, and changes in behavior.

2. Infection: The patient's fever, cough, and dyspnea suggest a possible infection, specifically multifocal pneumonia. Complications related to pneumonia can include sepsis, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Fluid Overload: The patient is experiencing fluid overload as indicated by her dyspnea and vital signs. This condition can lead to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

4. Leukopenia: Ms. [Known Lastname 4714] has leukopenia, which is a decrease in white blood cell count. This can increase the risk of infections and make it difficult to fight off any existing infections.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient also has thrombocytopenia, which is a decrease in platelet count. This increases the risk"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**], a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, is currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia. The patient's dyspnea has increased today, likely due to multifocal pneumonia and fluid overload. Treatment includes IV lasix, supplemental oxygen, and the continuation of antibiotics as per ID input. Multifocal pneumonia is confirmed by a CT scan, and induced sputum has been collected for further studies. The patient's altered mental status is improving with lactulose and likely improving pneumonia. Treatment involves limiting sedating medications, reorienting frequently, and monitoring for airway protection. Other concerns include probable multifactorial dyspnea, bronchospasm, and fluid overload, which will be treated accordingly. The patient's autoimmune hepatitis is now complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, and treatment involves starting rifaximin, holding azathioprine, continuing lactulose and ursodiol, and seeking hepatology recommendations. Leukopenia is improving and may be due to medication effect or current infection. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are near baseline, with chronic liver disease likely contributing. Asthma management involves continuing inhalers and holding further systemic steroids. A tooth infection is noted, with dental recommendations provided. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, and her overall respiratory status has worsened. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which is a severe lung infection. This condition can lead to respiratory distress, decreased oxygenation, and potential respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has autoimmune hepatitis and likely hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction. Symptoms may include confusion, altered mental status, and coma. Treatment involves managing the underlying liver disease and addressing the precipitating factors.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient's worsening CXR suggests fluid overload, which can occur due to inadequate fluid removal or excessive fluid administration. This can lead to pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, and decreased cardiac output.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and there is a concern for airway protection. Altered mental status can be due to hepatic encephalopathy, infection, or other factors. Close monitoring and frequent reorientation are necessary.

5. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which is a low white blood cell count"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis presenting with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has worsening respiratory status and is diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia. She also has altered mental status, likely improving pneumonia, dyspnea, and possible hepatic encephalopathy. Other conditions include leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthma, and chronic liver disease.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory status due to multifocal pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy, fluid overload, pulmonary embolism, coronary ischemia, and complications related to her autoimmune hepatitis.

The patient is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, bronchodilators, diuretics, and supportive care for her altered mental status. The medical team is also monitoring her laboratory values, including liver function tests, complete blood count, and electrolyte levels.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide appropriate supportive care, such as mechanical ventilation if necessary. Hepatic encephalopathy should be managed with lactulose and other measures to prevent further deterioration of mental status. Fluid balance should be carefully monitored to prevent fluid overload. Additionally, the patient's autoimmune hepatitis should be managed with appropriate medications and close follow-up with a hepatologist."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   > Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
   - Negative respiratory panel
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - ID also recommended CMV, enterovirus, adenovirus PCRs along with
   cryptococcal and histoplasma antigen tests.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4th dose, erroneous through obtained at
   3am, true trough pending from 9 am
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on induced sputum.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - attempt expectorated sputum today (last sample poor quality)
   > Altered mental status Improved now with lactulose and likely
   improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Continue Celexa
   - Monitor for airway protection
   > Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - place NGT
   - start rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   > Leukopenia: slowly improving  Probably due to medication effect (eg
   azathioprine) or current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia. She requires increased oxygen requirements and was placed on BiPAP overnight. She is currently being treated empirically for tularemia, PCP, and multifocal pneumonia with doxycycline, clindamycin, and primaquine. Broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and amikacin are also being administered. The patient is showing signs of volume overload, and efforts are being made to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 liter. She has received solumedrol for possible post-infectious BOOP and fluconazole for possible fungal infection. The patient's altered mental status is fluctuating, and she is receiving lactulose to manage hepatic encephalopathy. She is also being encouraged to take lactulose as she occasionally refuses. Sedating medications are being limited, and she is being reoriented frequently. Her autoimmune hepatitis treatment regimen includes rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol, although azathioprine has been temporarily withheld due to the infection. The patient's leukopenia is improving but may be due to medication effect or the current infection. Her asthma treatment involves continuing inhalers and systemic steroids. She also has a tooth infection and will undergo a panorex when stabilized. In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who has been admitted to the ICU for fever, cough, and dyspnea. The patient has a history of asthma, leukopenia, tooth infection, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been worsening, with increased oxygen requirements and the need for BiPAP intermittently. The patient is currently on multiple medications including doxycycline, clindamycin, primaquine for tularemia and PCP empirically, awaiting tularemia serologies and PCP from sputum. They are also receiving vancomycin and amikacin as part of broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

The patient's vital signs indicate a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 98 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 108/54 to 112/61 mmHg. Respiratory support includes a non-rebreather mask and CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a Vt of 544 mL, RR of 37, PEEP of 7 cmH2O, FiO2 of 80%, PIP of 22 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, pitting edema to the knees, and obesity with mild abdominal distension.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 2.2-4.4 K/uL, an elevated platelet count of 57-110 K/uL, and slightly elevated creatinine levels of 0.9-1.0 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits, but there is a slightly elevated LDH level of 447 IU/L.

The patient's assessment includes dyspnea/multifocal pneumonia, altered mental status, autoimmune hepatitis, leukopenia, asthma, and a tooth infection. The plan includes using BiPAP as tolerated, administering doxycycline, clindamycin, and primaquine for tularemia and PCP empirically, awaiting tularemia serologies and PCP from sputum. The patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and amikacin. Lasix drip will be continued until the patient's blood pressure drops, and solumedrol will be given for possible post-infectious BOOP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status leading to respiratory failure, development of septic shock due to the ongoing infection, worsening hepatic function, and potential worsening of the patient's mental status."

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and requires BiPAP support. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and amikacin, as well as medications for tularemia and PCP empirically. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/36 to 112/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, obesity with moderate abdominal distension, and 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally. Her neurological examination is grossly normal.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 185 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for dyspnea/multifocal pneumonia with BiPAP support, continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and empirical treatment for tularemia and PCP. The patient also requires management for altered mental status, autoimmune hepatitis, leukopenia, asthma"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and requires BiPAP for respiratory support. The patient has been treated with doxycycline, clindamycin, and primaquine for tularemia and PCP empirically, awaiting tularemia serologies and PCP from sputum. She is also on a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen including vancomycin and amikacin.

The patient has been diagnosed with volume overload, and lasix has been given to address this issue. Solumedrol has been administered for possible superimposed bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and fluconazole has been started empirically. The patient's altered mental status is noted to wax and wane, and she is receiving lactulose for this condition.

The patient's leukopenia is improving, likely due to medication effects or the current infection. She has a history of autoimmune hepatitis, asthma, and a tooth infection. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, and is receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT and PPI for stress ulcer prevention.

Overall, the patient's condition is deteriorating, and her prognosis is poor. She has multiple medical complications, including volume overload, altered mental status, leukopenia, asthma, and a tooth infection. The potential medical complications"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who is admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has multifocal pneumonia and is experiencing worsening respiratory status. She requires high levels of oxygen and has intermittent tolerance for BiPAP. Her recent labs show leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. She also has altered mental status, likely due to recent steroid dosing. The patient's condition is critical, and she has a poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, indicating an active infection. Multifocal pneumonia is evident on the CT scan, and there are increasing work of breathing and oxygen requirements. Continuous antibiotic treatment is recommended based on ID recommendations. Further studies include sputum culture, PCP, fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen, tularemia, and hantavirus serologies.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which is worsening with recent steroid dosing. Lactulose has been started, and the patient's mental status appears to be improving. Limiting sedating medications, frequent reorientation, continuing lactulose, treating infection, and lactulose for encephalopathy are part of the management plan.

3. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is multifactorial, including multifocal"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna, this AM with worsening of overall resp
   status this AM.
   > Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease now with
   increasing work of breathing and O2 requirement.
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] (unable to get bronchoscopy at this
   point in the absence of intubation at this point and patient is DNI)
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4th dose, erroneous through obtained at
   3am, true trough pending from 9 am
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on induced sputum.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Altered mental status Improved now with lactulose and likely
   improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Continue Celexa
   - Monitor for airway protection
   > Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.  Appears like volume
   playing a role now (based on CXR appearance). Could this be post
   infectious COP (seems unlikely but given grim prognosis reasonable to
   trial steroids [**4-28**]) and anti-fungal coverage
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   - has not been able to tolerate BiPAP (even with anxiolytics), although
   wore for about 4 hrs last night
   - Steroids for 24s to see if improvement
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - place NGT
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   > Leukopenia: slowly improving  Probably due to medication effect (eg
   azathioprine) or current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and her overall respiratory status has been worsening. The patient is critically ill and on mechanical ventilation support. She also has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Other issues include dyspnea, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthma, and potential complications such as post-infectious COPD and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's condition requires careful management and coordination of multiple medical specialties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's worsening respiratory status indicates a need for aggressive treatment for the multifocal pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease. Monitoring for signs of worsening encephalopathy and implementing appropriate interventions, such as lactulose administration, is essential.
3. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count may be due to medication effects or ongoing infection. Close monitoring of the CBC and holding azathioprine, if contributing to leukopenia, is recommended.
4. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thromb"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia. Her respiratory status has worsened over the past day. She is currently on multiple medications, including vancomycin, amikacin, doxycycline, clindamycin, primaquine, and citalopram.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function. Her vital signs indicate tachycardia and hypotension. She is on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient's worsening respiratory status and diffuse disease seen on the CT scan suggest a possible complication of pneumonia. The organism causing the infection is not yet identified, and further tests are pending.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease. She has been started on lactulose and will continue to be monitored.

3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating fluid overload. This could contribute to her dyspnea and may require diuretic therapy.

4. Pneumothorax: The worsening of her respiratory status and the appearance on the chest X-ray may indicate the development of a pneumoth"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna, this AM with worsening of overall resp
   status in the last few days.
   > Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease now with
   increasing work of breathing and O2 requirement.
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] (unable to get bronchoscopy at this
   point in the absence of intubation at this point and patient is DNI)
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4th dose, erroneous through obtained at
   3am, true trough pending from 9 am
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on induced sputum.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Altered mental status: worsened with recent steroid dosing.  Improved
   now with lactulose and likely improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Continue Celexa
    > Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likely.  Appears like volume
   playing a role now (based on CXR appearance). Could this be post
   infectious COP (seems unlikely but given grim prognosis reasonable to
   trial steroids [**4-28**]) and anti-fungal coverage
   - Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   - has not been able to tolerate BiPAP (even with anxiolytics), although
   wore for about 4 hrs last night , will cont to trial.
   - Steroids for 24hrs to see if improvement (decrease to solumedrol 60
   mg q 12h) as they appear to be having a deleterious affect on MS.
   - Abd U/S ? abdominal fluid, could be helpful in underlying atelectasis
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   > Leukopenia: slowly improving  Probably due to medication effect (eg
   azathioprine) or current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
    > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including pneumonia, hepatitis, leukopenia, and asthma. They are currently admitted to the ICU and have been receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 94%) and crackles in the respiratory chest examination suggest ongoing lung infection. If not properly managed, pneumonia can lead to further respiratory distress, sepsis, or even multi-organ failure.

2. Hepatitis: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 22/46) indicate liver dysfunction. This condition can progress to more severe liver damage, leading to impaired liver function and potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.

3. Leukopenia: The low white blood cell count (WBC: 2.2-2.9 K/uL) may increase the risk of infections, particularly in the context of pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection and considering appropriate interventions to boost the immune system would be important.

4. Asthma: The patient's history of asthma may pose respiratory challenges during their critical illness. Proper management of asthma symptoms and triggering factors is crucial to prevent exacerbations and ensure optimal oxygenation.

5. ICU-acquired complications: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a risk of developing ICU-acquired complications like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4714] is a 55-year-old female patient with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She was admitted with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia. The patient's condition worsened, leading to intubation due to increasing respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with altered mental status, leukopenia, asthma, and a potential tooth infection. The patient's oxygenation continued to deteriorate despite Bipap use. A decision was made to reverse the DNR/DNI status and consider tracheostomy, prolonged ventilator rehabilitation, and possible permanent ventilator dependence. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication empirically.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia and inability to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Sepsis secondary to the multifocal pneumonia and potential infections at other sites (e.g., tooth infection).
3. Complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
4. Neurological complications due to hypoxia and altered mental status.
5. Hemodynamic instability due to sepsis and autoimmune hepatitis.
6. Further deterioration of leukopenia and potential immunological compromise.
7. Potential complications from central venous catheters, such as bloodstream infections.
8. Complications from stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She is currently admitted to the ICU for fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia. The patient requires increased oxygenation and has been using BiPAP intermittently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's increased oxygen requirements and need for BiPAP suggest respiratory distress. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits fluctuating levels of consciousness, which may be related to hepatic encephalopathy or an infectious process. There is a risk of further deterioration or development of delirium.
3. Autoimmune Hepatitis: The patient has a known history of autoimmune hepatitis. There is a risk of disease exacerbation due to infection or medication effects.
4. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, likely secondary to medication or infection. There is a risk of further decrease in white blood cell count, increasing susceptibility to infections.
5. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma. There is a risk of exacerbation due to respiratory infections or stress.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever,
   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   * Dyspnea / Multifocal Pneumonia: Patient with increased O2
   requirements, requiring BiPAP intermittently  (pre-treated with ativan
   and zofran)
   - will use BiPAP as tolerated
   - on doxycycline, clinda, primaquine for tularemia and PCP empirically,
   awaiting tularemia serologies and PCP from sputum
   - repeat sputum cx until obtain a good sample
   - continue empiric broad spectrum abx w/ vancomycin and amikacin as
   well
   - continue current vanco dosing x 3 doses (1500mg daily) and recheck
   level after third dose
   - some component of volume overload, goal I/O negative; continue lasix
   drip at 8mg/hour and continue until BP drops
   - solumedrol 125mg IV q8hrs given x 3 doses overnight (for possible
   post infectious BOOP); then will decrease to 60mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - fluconazole 200mg PO daily given empirically, started [**2130-4-28**]
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue to treat supportively, patient is DNI
   - family member called late night on [**4-28**] with information that the
   patient was exposed to a ""sick cat"" prior to the onset of her illness,
   d/w ID the significance of this
   * Altered mental status: waxes and wanes, in general is AOx 3 and
   appropriate but occasionally drowsy. [**Month (only) 60**] benefit from weaning steroids,
   treating hypoxia.
   - Continue lactulose, patient occasionally refuses but will continue to
   encourage her
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue citalopram
   * Autoimmune hepatitis:
   - continue  rifaximin, lactulose and ursodiol, hold azathioprine given
   infection
   * Leukopenia - improving
   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or current
   infection.
   * Asthma
   -Continue inhalers
   -systemic steroids as above

Ms. [Known Lastname 4714], a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing increasing oxygen requirements, requiring intermittent use of BiPAP. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including doxycycline, clindamycin, and primaquine for tularemia and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), awaiting tularemia serologies and PCP from sputum. The patient is also receiving vancomycin and amikacin as part of the empirical therapy. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 108/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. Physical examination findings include diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, obesity with moderate abdominal distension, and 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally. Laboratory results show leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and altered blood coagulation parameters. 

The patient's condition has been assessed as follows:

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna, several days of worsening resp status with
   change in code status and subsequent reversal of code status and
   intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease now  intubated.
   Unclear primary cause.
   - Bronchoscopy today for airway inspection and sampling
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] (unable to get bronchoscopy at this
   point in the absence of intubation at this point and patient is DNI)
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on induced sputum.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload.  . Think PE, coronary ischemia less
   likelAppears like volume playing a role now (based on CXR appearance).
   Could this be post infectious COP (seems unlikely but given grim
   prognosis reasonable to trial steroids [**4-28**]) and anti-fungal coverage-
   Treat pna as above. Intubated on [**4-29**] with high PEEP requirements
   (likely in part [**12-26**] chest wall and abdominal obesity), can not put in
   esoph balloon in setting of  varices (no obvious ascites on US).
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg
   - Increase PEEP (unfortunately not able to tolerate
   - Is very difficult set of findings with some improvement seen in
   radiograph but slow to improve oxygenation
there is some evidence of
   decrease in CO2 across time which may argue for increased effective
   ventilation.
   -The unifying diagnosis, still remains to be defined, but an organizing
   pneumonia is certainly leading diagnosis.
   -Will pursue repeat CT following PEEP to evaluate extent of edema
   change and consider role of consolidation and organized pneumonia vs.
   edema
   -Continue steroids at current doses
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - Would check HIV viral load
   - Check parvo virus
    > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial with multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. There is a possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) or coronary ischemia, although less likely. The patient appears to have volume playing a role now (based on CXR appearance), and there is consideration for post-infectious COP (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or anti-fungal coverage.

2. Organizing pneumonia: The unifying diagnosis still remains to be defined, but organizing pneumonia is certainly a leading diagnosis. A repeat CT scan will be pursued following PEEP to evaluate the extent of edema change and consider the role of consolidation and organized pneumonia versus edema.

3. Autoimmune hepatitis: The patient has likely hepatic encephalopathy, and management should include continuing rifaximin, holding azathioprine due to cytopenia, continuing lactulose and ursodiol, and minimizing sedation.

4. Leukopenia: The patient has stable leukopenia, which may be due to medication"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna, several days of worsening resp status with
   change in code status and subsequent reversal of code status and
   intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease now  intubated.
   Unclear primary cause.
   - Bronchoscopy today for airway inspection and sampling
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] (unable to get bronchoscopy at this
   point in the absence of intubation at this point and patient is DNI)
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on induced sputum.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload.  . Think PE, coronary ischemia less
   likelAppears like volume playing a role now (based on CXR appearance).
   Could this be post infectious COP (seems unlikely but given grim
   prognosis reasonable to trial steroids [**4-28**]) and anti-fungal coverage-
   Treat pna as above. Intubated on [**4-29**] with high PEEP requirements
   (likely in part [**12-26**] chest wall and abdominal obesity), can not put in
   esoph balloon in setting of  varices (no obvious ascites on US).
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg
   - Increase PEEP (unfortunately not able to tolerate
   - Stop steroids [**4-29**]
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - Would check HIV viral load
   - Check parvo virus
    > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pneumonia. She has been experiencing worsening respiratory status with a change in code status and subsequent intubation on [4-29]. The patient has multiple medical complications, including multifocal pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, autoimmune hepatitis with likely hepatic encephalopathy, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and asthma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient's worsening respiratory status and change in code status suggest a severe infection in the lungs. Multifocal pneumonia could be due to various causes, including bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. This can lead to further deterioration of respiratory function and potentially develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate respiratory failure. This condition can be caused by lung diseases (such as pneumonia) or other factors affecting oxygenation. If not managed appropriately, it can progress to severe ARDS and may require mechanical ventilation.

3. Autoimmune hepatitis with hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis, which is an inflammatory liver disease. Hepatic encephalopathy can occur as a complication of liver disease and is characterized by cognitive impairment and altered mental status. Proper management of hepatic encephalopathy is crucial to prevent further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna, this AM with worsening of overall resp
   status in the last few days.
   > Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease now with
   increasing work of breathing and O2 requirement.
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U sputum culture, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] (unable to get bronchoscopy at this
   point in the absence of intubation at this point and patient is DNI)
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Check vanc trough prior to 4th dose, erroneous through obtained at
   3am, true trough pending from 9 am
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on induced sputum.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Altered mental status: worsened with recent steroid dosing.  Improved
   now with lactulose and likely improving pneumonia.
   - Limit sedating meds, reorient frequently
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue to treat infection, lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Continue Celexa
    > Dyspnea: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna, bronchospasm
   and fluid overload.  I/O negative and CXR worsened so less likely fluid
   overload. Think PE, coronary ischemia less likelAppears like volume
   playing a role now (based on CXR appearance). Could this be post
   infectious COP (seems unlikely but given grim prognosis reasonable to
   trial steroids [**4-28**]) and anti-fungal coverage- Treat pna as above
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - follow daily wts and I/O goal -500 cc
   - has not been able to tolerate BiPAP (even with anxiolytics), although
   wore for about 4 hrs last night , will cont to trial.
   - Steroids for 24hrs to see if improvement (decrease to solumedrol 60
   mg q 12h) as they appear to be having a deleterious affect on MS.
   - Abd U/S ? abdominal fluid, could be helpful in underlying atelectasis
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - [**Month (only) 60**] resume spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   > Leukopenia: slowly improving  Probably due to medication effect (eg
   azathioprine) or current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
    > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
   >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and her respiratory status has been worsening over the last few days. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She also has altered mental status, likely due to recent steroid dosing, but it is improving now with lactulose treatment. The patient's dyspnea is multifactorial, including multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. There is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism or coronary ischemia, but these are less likely. The patient also has hepatic encephalopathy and is being treated with lactulose and ursodiol. She has leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are improving slowly. The patient has a history of asthma and autoimmune hepatitis. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment for her various conditions."

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leukopenia, asthma, and hepatitis other. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday and showed some improvement in the density of opacifications on the CT chest. The ventilator settings were adjusted to PEEP at 15 cmH2O and FiO2 at 70%. The patient's urine output has improved overnight and he received bolus 1 L of fluid. The RNs are concerned about sedation.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, aspirin, sulfa (sulfonamides), ibuprofen, ginger, and anaphylaxis to antibiotics like vancomycin and amikacin. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin at 08:00 AM, amikacin at 10:00 PM, and clindamycin at 04:30 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on the ventilator.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 8.6 g"

   cough, and dyspnea and multifocal pna.
   * Dyspnea / Multifocal Pneumonia
 Intubated due to increasing
   respiratory distress. Consider ARDS vs infection
   - serial ABGs
   - f/u BAL results
   - on doxycycline, clinda, primaquine for tularemia and PCP empirically,
   awaiting tularemia serologies and PCP from sputum
   - d/c fluconazole today as no longer indicated
   - continue empiric broad spectrum abx w/ vancomycin and amikacin as
   well (will hold dose tonight)
   - appreciate ID recs
   - I/O even for today to maximize pulmonary status
   - d/c steroids
   * Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely [**12-26**] multifocal pneumonia
   - lower Vt to 6 cc/kg
   - continue antibiotics
   .
   * ARF: Cr 1.4 today from 1.0
   - bolus for UOP
   * Sedation:
   - attempt to wean sedation by 20% to avoid liver/kidney insult
   * Altered mental status: now intubated and sedated; likely [**12-26**] hypoxia,
   steroids
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue citalopram
   * Autoimmune hepatitis:
   - continue rifaximin, lactulose and ursodiol
   - hold azathioprine given infection
   * Leukopenia: Consider immunological compromise vs med effect
   - send HIV VL, CD4 today
   - heme consult today for leukopenia
   - d/c fluconazole for side effect of leukopenia
   - d/c ursodiol for side effect of leukopenia

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, presenting with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia. She was intubated due to increasing respiratory distress. There are concerns about acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) versus infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 70%. Her blood glucose level is elevated at 182 mg/dL.

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypoxic respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), altered mental status, autoimmune hepatitis, leukopenia, asthma, and a tooth infection. She is receiving multiple medications, including broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, amikacin, clindamycin, doxycycline), antifungals (fluconazole), antivirals (priming), immunosuppressants (azathioprine), and medications for her asthma and autoimmune hepatitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions and treatment include ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea and has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia. The patient's respiratory condition has worsened, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. She is currently being treated for suspected tularemia and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) empirically, as well as for her underlying autoimmune hepatitis. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hypoxia and steroids. She has leukopenia and is awaiting further investigations, including HIV VL and CD4 levels, to assess for possible immunological compromise. The patient also has a history of asthma and a tooth infection. She is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be essential.
2. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression due to autoimmune hepatitis and potential HIV infection may increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Regular infection control measures and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be implemented.
3. Barotrauma: The patient's high PIP and PEEP settings may increase the risk of barotrauma,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who is currently admitted to the ICU for fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia. She has been intubated due to increasing respiratory distress. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and amikacin, as well as doxycycline, clindamycin, and primaquine for tularemia and PCP empirically. She also receives fluconazole daily. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. Her laboratory results indicate leukopenia and altered liver function tests. The patient's past medical history includes asthma, autoimmune hepatitis, leukopenia, and a tooth infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and the presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining proper airway hygiene, regular bronchoscopy, and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to leukopenia and autoimmune hepatitis makes her susceptible to nosocomial infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and prompt identification and treatment of any new infection are crucial.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's severe pneumonia and hypoxia may progress to ARDS, which is characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltr"

      NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
   CT Chest [**4-30**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Extensive patchy air space opacification scattered throughout both
   lungs
   is similar in distribution and extent to CT performed on [**2130-4-26**],
   but
   less dense in most locstions, compatible with some improvement. The
   differential diagnosis for this appearance is broad but includes
   resolving
   multifocal pneumonia or edema.
   2. Cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites.
   CXR: [**5-1**]:   ETT in good position. Subclavian PICC, Multifocal opacities
   unchanged
   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna with progression into ARDS vs inflammatory
   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code
   status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease now  intubated.
   Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see below)
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U BAL sample from [**4-30**]
   - F/u pending serologies
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on BAL from [**4-30**]
   - Stop fluconazole [**5-1**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This could well be a infection that has now progressed into ARDS. This
   raises the possibility if an inflammatory lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.  Cont supportive low Vt
   vent strategy
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (will go down to 6 cc/kg).
   -Stop steroids as no inflammatory process driving this (BAL fluid c/w
   high PMN)
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - Would check HIV viral load
   - Check parvo virus
     > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her condition is complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. The bronchoscopic lavage (BAL) revealed no significant findings, indicating that the infection may have progressed into ARDS. Other potential causes, such as an inflammatory lung condition, post-infectious COP, autoimmune inflammatory pneumonitis, or pulmonary lymphoma, should also be considered. 

In terms of management, the patient is being treated with vancomycin, amikacin, and doxycycline as per the recommendations of the infectious disease (ID) team. The ID team also recommends further BAL samples and pending serologies. The patient is also receiving bronchodilators to address bronchospasm. 

The patient's autoimmune hepatitis is being managed with rifaximin, lactulose, ursodiol, spironolactone, and holding azathioprine due to cytopenia. 

The patient's leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are being monitored closely, with plans to check the CBC daily and evaluate for HIV or medication-related causes. 

Overall, the patient is critically ill and"

   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna vs inflammatory lung disease, several days
   of worsening resp status with change in code status and subsequent
   reversal of code status and intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia: CT scan with diffuse disease now  intubated.
   Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see below)
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/U BAL sample from [**4-30**]
   - Pending studies include fungal antigens, legionella urinary antigen,
   tularemia and hantavirus serologies.
   - Check amikacin dose prior to 2nd dose, goal trough <4
   - Continue Clinda/ Primaquine will stop if neg PCP on induced sputum.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This raises the possibility if an inflammatorey lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy.
   -Continue steroids at current doses
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - Would check HIV viral load
   - Check parvo virus
     > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and is currently intubated. The patient also has autoimmune hepatitis with likely hepatic encephalopathy, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and asthma. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient may develop further respiratory infections or experience worsening of her current condition, leading to complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate, resulting in severe oxygenation problems and potential organ damage due to inadequate oxygen supply.

3. Autoimmune hepatitis with hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function may continue to deteriorate, leading to worsening encephalopathy and potential hepatic failure. This can affect various organ systems and overall prognosis.

4. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count makes her more susceptible to infections. If her leukopenia worsens, it could increase the risk of severe infections.

5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's low red blood cell and platelet counts may contribute to complications such as bleeding or poor oxygen delivery to tissues.

6. Asthma: The patient may experience exacerbations of"

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating despite treatment, and she required intubation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 64/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on mechanical ventilation. The patient is sedated and not responsive. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 105 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are likely due to chronic liver disease. 

The patient has been on various medications including vancomycin, doxycycline, aztreonam, fluconazole, and steroids. She has also received fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/ARDS: The patient's worsening respiratory status and the presence of diffuse disease on CT scan indicate a potential complication of pneumonia progressing into ARDS. 
2. Hypox"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna with progression into ARDS vs inflammatory
   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code
   status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: CT scan with diffuse disease now
   intubated.  Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see
   below)
   - Continue vancomycin, amikacin and doxycycline per ID recommendations
   - F/u pending serologies
   - Stopped  Clinda/ Primaquine ( neg PCP on BAL from [**4-30**])
   - Stop fluconazole [**5-1**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This could well be a infection that has now progressed into ARDS. This
   raises the possibility if an inflammatory lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.  Cont supportive low Vt
   vent strategy
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (will go down to 6 cc/kg).
   -Stop steroids as no inflammatory process driving this (BAL fluid c/w
   high PMN)
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection. Not currently neutropenic.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - F/u HIV viral load
   - F/u parvo virus
   - Appreciate heme input
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
    >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who was admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She developed multifocal pneumonia that progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to intubation on April 29th. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and higher PEEP. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64/52 to 64/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 105 K/uL. Liver enzymes are elevated, with alanine transaminase (ALT) at 17 U/L and aspartate transaminase (AST) at 29 U/L. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, amikacin, doxycycline, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and rifaximin. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Multifocal pneumonia/ARDS: The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, and she is now on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for possible infectious or inflammatory"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna with progression into ARDS vs inflammatory
   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code
   status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: CT scan with diffuse disease now
   intubated.  Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see
   below)
   - Continue vancomycin, and doxycycline per ID recommendations. Amikacin
   changed to  to aztreonam
   - F/u pending serologies
   - Stopped  Clinda/ Primaquine ( neg PCP on BAL from [**4-30**])
   - Stop fluconazole [**5-1**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This could well be a infection that has now progressed into ARDS. This
   raises the possibility if an inflammatory lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.  Cont supportive low Vt
   vent strategy (plateaus OK at 27 and no auto PEEP)
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (6 cc/kg).
   -Stopped steroids [**5-1**] as no inflammatory process driving this (BAL
   fluid c/w high PMN)
   - Versed , Fent 150, cont slow wean
    > Renal failure: amikcain toxicit vs volume shifts, will check urine
   lytes and renal U/S
   - cont volume support
   - urine lytes and eos, UA
   - renal U/S
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection.  She did get one dose of GCSF, but stopped for
   concern of splenic rupture in patients with splenomegaly.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - F/u parvo virus
   - Appreciate heme input
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
    >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to intubation. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she requires mechanical ventilation. This indicates severe hypoxemia and the possibility of further deterioration in lung function.

2. Inflammatory lung disease: The patient's bronchoscopic examination did not reveal any infectious secretions, raising the possibility of an inflammatory lung condition such as post-infectious COP or autoimmune inflammatory pneumonitis.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has autoimmune hepatitis and is now showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy. This can lead to altered mental status and neurological complications.

4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, possibly due to amikacin toxicity or volume shifts. Close monitoring and management of renal function are essential to prevent further deterioration.

5. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which may be caused by medication effects (such as azathioprine), current infection, or septic suppression of the bone marrow. Regular monitoring of complete blood counts is necessary to assess the patient's immune status and response to treatment.

6. Anemia and thromb"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), a heart rate of 94 bpm, a blood pressure of 101/48 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 340 mL, the set respiratory rate (RR) is 24 breaths per minute, the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 12 cmH2O, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 60%, and the plateau pressure is 27 cmH2O.

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments. She was given an incorrect dose of dilantin and an incident report has been written. Her BAL was negative for PCP, and primaquine and fluc were discontinued. She was switched from amikacin to aztreonam due to renal failure. G-CSF was initially recommended but later reconsidered due to the risk of splenic rupture. Quantitative Ig levels have been ordered for consideration of using IVIG. Tube feeds"

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Lastname 4714], a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, is currently admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is mechanically ventilated, and an arterial line has been placed. The main concerns include the patient's respiratory status, acute kidney injury (ARF), sedation management, autoimmune hepatitis, leukopenia, hypernatremia, and asthma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ARDS may lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), worsening gas exchange, and potential need for tracheostomy.

2. Renal Complications: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level of 1.6. There is a risk of worsening renal function or development of acute kidney injury (AKI), which can impact fluid management and medication dosing.

3. Infection-related Complications: With multifocal pneumonia and ongoing fever, there is a possibility of developing new infections or worsening of existing ones. This could include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bloodstream infections, or secondary bacterial infections due to immunosuppression.

4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's autoimmune hepatitis and sedation medications increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatoren"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**], a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine level has increased from baseline (1.0 to 1.6), indicating potential renal impairment. Monitoring urine output and conducting further investigations such as urine electrolytes and urinalysis with sediment is recommended to assess renal function and identify any underlying causes.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to her ARDS and requirement for mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adherence to appropriate infection control measures are crucial in preventing VAP.

3. Infectious complications: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of fever, it is important to consider the possibility of other infections besides pneumonia. Further investigations, such as blood cultures, should be conducted to identify any additional infectious agents.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis and is receiving medications like lactulose. Hepatic encephalopathy can occur in patients with liver dysfunction. Monitoring for signs of altered mental status or other symptoms of hepatic enceph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a body mass index of 22.7. They are currently in the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, sulfa (sulfonamides), ibuprofen, and ginger. The patient's recent vital signs include a temperature range of 36.9-37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 93-107 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 68-126 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's medical history includes renal issues, heme/oncological conditions, and infectious disease concerns. 

The patient's renal function has shown improvement with increased urine output after receiving 1 L of normal saline. However, their hematocrit levels are low at 22.7%, and they have a positive stool guaiac test, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's blood pressure has decreased, and they are currently on a fluid challenge. 

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 340 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna with progression into ARDS vs inflammatory
   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code
   status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: CT scan with diffuse disease now
   intubated.  Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see
   below)
   - Continue vancomycin, and doxycycline per ID recommendations. Amikacin
   changed to  to aztreonam
   - F/u pending serologies
   - Stopped  Clinda/ Primaquine ( neg PCP on BAL from [**4-30**])
   - Stop fluconazole [**5-1**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This could well be a infection that has now progressed into ARDS. This
   raises the possibility if an inflammatory lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.  Cont supportive low Vt
   vent strategy (plateaus OK at 27 and no auto PEEP)
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (6 cc/kg).
   -Stopped steroids [**5-1**] as no inflammatory process driving this (BAL
   fluid c/w high PMN)
   - Versed , Fent 150, cont slow wean
     > Renal failure: amikcain toxicit vs volume shifts, will check urine
   lytes and renal U/S
   - cont volume support
   - urine lytes and eos, UA
   - renal U/S
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
    > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant
   improvement on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic
   suppression of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg
   azathioprine) or current infection.  She did get one dose of GCSF, but
   stopped for concern of splenic rupture in patients with splenomegaly.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - F/u parvo virus
   - Appreciate heme input
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
    >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis presenting with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been admitted to the ICU and intubated due to worsening respiratory status. The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This is indicated by diffuse disease on a CT scan and no secretions found in the proximal or distal airways during bronchoscopy.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, including multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. A low tidal volume ventilation strategy is being used, and higher PEEP protocol has been initiated.
3. Renal Failure: The patient may be experiencing renal failure, possibly due to amikacin toxicity or volume shifts. Urine electrolytes, renal ultrasound, and other renal function tests are being monitored.
4. Autoimmune Hepatitis with Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis and now shows signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Medications such as rifaximin, lactulose, ursodiol, spironolactone, and hepatology recommendations are being implemented.
5. Leukopenia: The patient has leuk"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna with progression into ARDS vs inflammatory
   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code
   status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: CT scan with diffuse disease now
   intubated.  Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see
   below), however 1,3 glucan is positive (125) which is potentially
   suggestive of fungal vs pneumocystis however the BAL was negative.
   -  check blasto and coccido (histo urine Ag neg)
   - recheck 1,3 glucan
   - Continue vancomycin, and doxycycline per ID recommendations. Amikacin
   changed to  to aztreonam
   - F/u pending serologies
   - Stopped  Clinda/ Primaquine ( neg PCP on BAL from [**4-30**]),
   - Stop fluconazole [**5-1**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This could well be a infection that has now progressed into ARDS. This
   raises the possibility if an inflammatory lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.  Cont supportive low Vt
   vent strategy (plateaus OK at 27 [**5-3**])
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg when Cr stabilizes
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (6 cc/kg).
   -Stopped steroids [**5-1**] as no inflammatory process driving this (BAL
   fluid c/w high PMN)
   - Versed , Fent 150, cont slow wean
     > Renal failure: amikcain toxicit vs volume shifts, urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal (Cr and urine improved with fluid challenge).
   Will let her auto-regualte, unable to diuresed at this point.  No
   evidence of urine eos.
   - cont volume support
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection.  She did get one dose of GCSF, but stopped for
   concern of splenic rupture in patients with splenomegaly.  She has had
   a vigorous response.in her WBC.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - Appreciate heme input
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
    >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has multifocal pneumonia with progression into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) versus inflammatory lung disease. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to a change in code status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**]. She also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial with multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. The bronchoscopy on [**4-30**] revealed no secretions in the proximal or distal airways (on lavage), raising the possibility of an inflammatory lung condition such as post-infectious COP or atypical presentation of pulmonary lymphoma. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, possibly due to amikacin toxicity versus volume shifts, with urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal azotemia. Her autoimmune hepatitis has likely progressed to hepatic encephalopathy, and she has leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is also being treated for asthma and has hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/ARDS: The patient's worsening respiratory status and positive 1,3 glucan suggest a potential fungal infection. Further investigation is needed to confirm this, including checking for Blastomyces dermatitidis and Coccidioides im"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna with progression into ARDS vs inflammatory
   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code
   status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: CT scan with diffuse disease now
   intubated.  Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see
   below), however 1,3 glucan is positive (125) which is potentially
   suggestive of fungal vs pneumocystis however the BAL was negative.
   -  check blasto and coccido (histo urine Ag neg)
   - recheck 1,3 glucan
   - Continue vancomycin, and doxycycline per ID recommendations. Amikacin
   changed to  to aztreonam
   - F/u pending serologies
   - Stopped  Clinda/ Primaquine ( neg PCP on BAL from [**4-30**]),
   - Stop fluconazole [**5-1**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This could well be a infection that has now progressed into ARDS. This
   raises the possibility if an inflammatory lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.  Cont supportive low Vt
   vent strategy (plateaus OK at 27 [**5-3**])
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg when Cr stabilizes
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (6 cc/kg).
   -Stopped steroids [**5-1**] as no inflammatory process driving this (BAL
   fluid c/w high PMN)
   - Versed , Fent 150, cont slow wean
     > Renal failure: amikcain toxicit vs volume shifts, urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal (Cr and urine improved with fluid challenge).
   Will let her auto-regualte, unable to diuresed at this point.  No
   evidence of urine eos.
   - cont volume support
   > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection.  She did get one dose of GCSF, but stopped for
   concern of splenic rupture in patients with splenomegaly.  She has had
   a vigorous response.in her WBC.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - Appreciate heme input
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
    >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has multifocal pneumonia that has progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to intubation. The initial BAL was clear, but a positive 1,3 glucan suggests a possible fungal infection, although the BAL was negative. The patient is currently on vancomycin and doxycycline, with amikacin changed to aztreonam. It is recommended to recheck the 1,3 glucan and continue with ID recommendations.

The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial due to multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. A bronchoscopy revealed no secretions in the proximal or distal airways, raising the possibility of an inflammatory lung condition such as post-infectious COPD, autoimmune hepatitis, or atypical presentation of pulmonary lymphoma. A supportive low Vt ventilation strategy is being continued, along with bronchodilators and higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy.

The patient has renal failure, possibly due to amikacin toxicity or pre-renal volume shifts. The urine electrolytes are consistent with pre-renal azotemia, and the Cr and urine output have improved with fluid challenge. The patient will be allowed to auto-regulate, and diuresis will"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**], a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis, is currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia. She is receiving mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's arterial line was attempted but unsuccessful, so she is being managed by oxygen saturation monitoring instead. Her hypernatremia has improved, and her creatinine levels are stable. She is also being treated for potential opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and fungal infections like blastomycosis and coccidiomycosis. The patient's sedation is being weaned to avoid accumulation, and her autoimmune hepatitis treatment plan includes rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol. Azathioprine has been temporarily halted due to the infection. Leukopenia is being assessed for possible immunological compromise or medication effects. The patient has a history of asthma, and her inhalers will be continued. A panorex is planned to address a tooth infection once she is stabilized. The patient's current code status is full code, and her disposition is still pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's current ARDS and presence of multifocal pneumonia, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening hyp"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4714**] is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who was admitted with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her arterial line was attempted but unsuccessful, so she is being managed by oxygen saturation levels. She has hypernatremia and her creatinine level is elevated. The patient's white blood cell count is low, indicating leukopenia. She also has liver enzyme abnormalities. Treatment plans include continuing antibiotics, sending fungal cultures, and monitoring urine output. Sedation is being weaned to avoid accumulation. Medications for autoimmune hepatitis are also being continued, except for azathioprine due to infection. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is still in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent and treat this complication.
2. Nosocomial infection: Due to her immunocompromised state, the patient is at an increased risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. Proper infection control measures should be implemented to minimize this risk.
3. Liver failure: The patient's autoimmune hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes indicate potential liver dysfunction. Monitoring liver function and managing the underlying autoimmune condition are crucial to prevent further complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy at 11:45 AM and an arterial line was attempted but unsuccessful. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C (99.3Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 104/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated on a ventilator in assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 340 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 122, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,796 mL and total output of 1,925 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 871 mL. The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 148 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 63 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and a decreased urine output of 480 mL in the past 24 hours. The patient's other lab results include leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.6 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.1%, and decreased platelet count (Plt) of 105. The patient has a history of asthma, allergies to penicillins, aspirin, sulfa, ibuprofen, and ginger, and is currently receiving fentanyl infusion. The patient's medical history includes community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and hepatitis other. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium level indicates hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration, neurological complications, and increased risk of seizures.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on imaging suggest ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli. ARDS can progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN, creatinine levels, and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure. This condition can worsen if the patient's renal function continues to deteriorate.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's low W"

   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna with progression into ARDS vs inflammatory
   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code
   status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: CT scan with diffuse disease now
   intubated.  Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see
   below), however 1,3 glucan is positive (125) which is potentially
   suggestive of fungal vs pneumocystis however the BAL was negative.
   Repeat BAL pending.
   -  check blasto and coccido (histo urine Ag neg)
   - recheck 1,3 glucan
   - Continue vancomycin, and doxycycline per ID recommendations. Amikacin
   changed to  to aztreonam
   - F/u pending serologies
   - Stopped  Clinda/ Primaquine ( neg PCP on BAL from [**4-30**]),
   - Stop fluconazole [**5-1**].
   - F/u BAL specimen
   - ID recommendations appreciated
    > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This could well be a infection that has now progressed into ARDS. This
   raises the possibility if an inflammatory lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.  Cont supportive low Vt
   vent strategy (plateaus OK at 27 [**5-3**])
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg when Cr stabilizes
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (6 cc/kg).
   -Stopped steroids [**5-1**] as no inflammatory process driving this (BAL
   fluid c/w high PMN)
   - Versed , Fent 50 cont slow wean
   > Renal failure: amikcain toxicit vs volume shifts, urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal (Cr and urine improved with fluid challenge).
   Will let her auto-regualte, unable to diuresed at this point.  No
   evidence of urine eos.

    > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol

   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection.  She did get one dose of GCSF, but stopped for
   concern of splenic rupture in patients with splenomegaly.  She has had

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to intubation.

The assessment and plan include several potential complications:

1. Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: The patient's CT scan shows diffuse disease, indicating a widespread infection or inflammation in the lungs. The positive 1,3 glucan test suggests a possible fungal infection, but the subsequent BAL was negative. Further tests are pending, including rechecking for Blastomyces and Coccidioides, as well as repeating the 1,3 glucan test. Antibiotics have been adjusted based on ID recommendations.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. A bronchoscopy revealed no secretions in the proximal or distal airways, suggesting that the condition might be an infection progressing into ARDS or an inflammatory lung disease such as post-infectious COPD, autoimmune hepatitis, or pulmonary lymphoma. The current plan is to continue bronchodilators and a low tidal volume ventilation strategy.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and urine electrolytes suggest pre-renal azotemia, possibly due to am"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient also has renal failure, likely due to amikacin toxicity or volume shifts, and hepatic encephalopathy. Additionally, she has leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which could be caused by medication effects, current infection, or septic suppression of the bone marrow. The patient's asthma requires continued management with inhalers, and systemic steroids are being held at this time.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory status, further deterioration of renal function, progression of hepatic encephalopathy, development of additional infections, and potential complications related to the patient's autoimmune hepatitis and underlying conditions.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values. Frequent assessment of the patient's mental status and neurologic function is also necessary due to the presence of hepatic encephalopathy. Close attention should be paid to the patient's blood counts, especially white blood cell count, as well as liver function tests and renal function tests. The patient's nutritional status should be evaluated and managed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   55F with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and
   dyspnea and multifocal pna with progression into ARDS vs inflammatory
   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code
   status and subsequent intubation on [**4-29**].
   > Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: CT scan with diffuse disease now
   intubated.  Unclear primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear (see
   below), however 1,3 glucan is positive (125) which is potentially
   suggestive of fungal vs pneumocystis however the BAL was negative.
   Repeat BAL pending.
   -  check blasto and coccido (histo urine Ag neg)
   - recheck 1,3 glucan
   - Continue vancomycin, and doxycycline per ID recommendations. Amikacin
   changed to  to aztreonam
   - F/u pending serologies
   - Stopped  Clinda/ Primaquine ( neg PCP on BAL from [**4-30**]),
   - Stop fluconazole [**5-1**].
   - F/u BAL specimen
   - ID recommendations appreciated
    > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage).
   This could well be a infection that has now progressed into ARDS. This
   raises the possibility if an inflammatory lung condition: post
   infectious COP (although no signif improvement with steroids, vs AIP vs
   a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.  Cont supportive low Vt
   vent strategy (plateaus OK at 27 [**5-3**])
   - Continue bronchodilators
   - balance net neg when Cr stabilizes
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (6 cc/kg).
   -Stopped steroids [**5-1**] as no inflammatory process driving this (BAL
   fluid c/w high PMN)
   - Versed , Fent 50 cont slow wean
   > Renal failure: amikcain toxicit vs volume shifts, urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal (Cr and urine improved with fluid challenge).
   Will let her auto-regualte, unable to diuresed at this point.  No
   evidence of urine eos.
   - cont volume support
    > Autoimmune hepatitis: now with likely hepatic encephalopathy
   - cont rifaximin
   - Holding azathioprine given cytopenia
   - Continue lactulose and ursodiol
   - Cont spironolactone
   - Hepatology recommendations appreciated
   - minimize sedation
   > Leukopenia: stable, but interestingly with no significant improvement
   on steroids, ? HIV or now new toxic medications vs septic suppression
   of marrow.   Probably due to medication effect (eg azathioprine) or
   current infection.  She did get one dose of GCSF, but stopped for
   concern of splenic rupture in patients with splenomegaly.  She has had
   a vigorous response.in her WBC.
   - Follow CBC daily
   - Holding azathioprine as above
   - Appreciate heme input
   > Anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -Hct and plts near baseline. Normal B12 and folate [**10-1**]. Chronic liver
   disease likely contributory.
   - Follow CBC daily
    >Asthma
   - Continue inhalers
   - Holding on further systemic steroids at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has multifocal pneumonia with progression into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) versus inflammatory lung disease. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to intubation. The primary cause of the pneumonia is unclear as the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was essentially clear, but the 1,3 glucan test is positive, suggesting a potential fungal infection. The BAL was negative for pneumocystis, but repeat BAL is pending. The patient is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. A bronchoscopy revealed no secretions in the proximal or distal airways. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to amikacin toxicity or volume shifts. Urine electrolytes are consistent with pre-renal failure, and the patient's creatinine and urine output have improved with fluid challenge. 

The patient has autoimmune hepatitis with likely hepatic encephalopathy. Medications include rifaximin, lactulose, ursodiol, spironolactone, and azathioprine. 

The patient also has leukopenia, which may be due to medication effect or current infection. There is no significant improvement on steroids, and the patient's white blood cell count has responded well"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and various medications, including antibiotics and medications for autoimmune hepatitis. Her vital signs are stable, but she has ongoing issues with hypernatremia and fluid balance. There are concerns about potential complications such as ARF (acute renal failure), leukopenia, and an immunological compromise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's current serum creatinine levels are improving, but there is a concern for ongoing renal issues. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Leukopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, which may indicate an immunological compromise or a medication effect. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and guide appropriate management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, presenting with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 110/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,005 mL (1,138 mL PO, 1,952 mL IVF, and 800 mL NG), with an output of 3,790 mL (total out). The patient has received multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and supportive care. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit and platelet count, increased creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's medical history includes autoimmune hepatitis, asthma, leukopenia, and a tooth infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation puts her at risk for developing VAP.

   lung disease, several days of worsening resp status with change in code

   > Multifocal Pneumonia/ARDS: CT scan with diffuse disease with unclear
   primary cause as BAL was essentialy clear initially  (see below),
   however 1,3 glucan is positive (125) which is potentially suggestive of
   fungal vs pneumocystis however the BAL was negative.  Repeat BAL neg
   for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] may well be established ARDS (we cont to cover broadly

   - F/u BAL specimen and GM in the BAL
   - Will spp out yeast from [**4-30**], no empiric therapy
    > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Probably multifactorial with multifocal pna,
   bronchospasm and fluid overload. Interestingly the bromnchscopsy on [**4-30**]
   revealed no secreiotns in the proxial or distal airways (on lavage)
   however more recently on [**5-3**] there was increased seretions potentially
   indicating a new superimposed process.   This could well be a infection
   that has now progressed into ARDS. Less likely an inflammatory lung
   condition: post infectious COP (although no signif improvement with
   steroids, vs AIP vs a very atypical presentation of pulm lymphoma.

   - Continue bronchodilators
   -net fluid balance (may need lasix gtt)
   - Higher PEEP protocol with low Vt strategy (6 cc/kg). Will decrease
   FiO2 to 40% and then decrease PEEP 10. When PEEP 10 or less would try
   PS settings

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to a change in code status and subsequent intubation on 04/29. 

The patient's medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly multifactorial with multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. There is also a possibility of a new superimposed infection or an inflammatory lung condition such as post-infectious COP, autoimmune interstitial pneumonia (AIP), or atypical presentation of pulmonary lymphoma.

The patient's renal function has improved with a fluid challenge, suggesting pre-renal azotemia possibly due to amikacin toxicity or volume shifts. The plan is to diurese today to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1 liter.

The patient is also experiencing low-grade fevers, which will be evaluated with blood and urine cultures. Additionally, the patient has hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.

The patient is currently receiving supportive care in the ICU, including mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy, bronchodilators, prophylactic antibiotics, stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and venous thromboembolism prevention"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea and was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, and she required intubation on April 29th. 

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Multifocal pneumonia/ARDS: The patient's CT scan shows diffuse disease with unclear primary cause. Initial BAL was clear, but subsequent tests showed a positive 1,3 glucan, which is suggestive of fungal infection or pneumocystis pneumonia. However, the BAL was negative for PCP. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, doxycycline, and aztreonam. Repeat BAL and GM in the BAL are being followed.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This is likely multifactorial, including multifocal pneumonia, bronchospasm, and fluid overload. A recent bronchoscopic lavage revealed no secretions in the proximal or distal airways, but there were increased secretions on May 3rd, potentially indicating a new superimposed process. The patient's low tidal volume ventilation strategy is being continued, along with bronchodilators, net fluid balance, and higher PEEP protocol.

3. Low-grade fevers: Blood and urine cultures have been ordered"

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, PaO2 of 135 mmHg, HCO3- of 32 mEq/L, BE of -10 mEq/L, and O2 saturation of 98%. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination are not assessed at this time.

The patient's laboratory results indicate hypernatremia with a sodium level of 149 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 89 K/uL, glucose level of 178 mg/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.3 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 79 K/uL. Other lab values include elevated creatinine (Cr), elevated TCO2, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated lactate, low albumin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,527 mL and output of 2,385 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 340 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's condition should be closely monitored for any signs of clinical deterioration and appropriate interventions should be implemented accordingly."

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, currently admitted to the ICU for multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.2Â°F (37.9Â°C), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 103/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an ongoing infection. The liver function tests reveal elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, which may be related to her autoimmune hepatitis. The patient also has leukopenia with a low platelet count.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.46, which is slightly alkalotic. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 135, indicating some improvement in oxygenation. The chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, aspirin, sulfa drugs, ibuprofen, and ginger. She is currently receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, citalop"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a history of CMV infection, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and stable oxygen saturation. Fluid balance reveals a positive input of 4,013 mL and output of 3,170 mL with an overall balance of 843 mL. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at TV 300 mL, RR 24 breaths per minute, FiO2 50%, and PEEP 8 cmH2O. ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 65 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 170. Physical examination findings include intubation, sedation, opening eyes to verbal stimuli, and presence of bilateral scattered wheezes and crackles. Lab results indicate leukopenia with a WBC count of 4.9 K/uL, anemia with Hct of 26.1%, thrombocytopenia with Plt of 88 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 140 and 175 mg/dL.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, presenting with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, aztreonam, and doxycycline. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 102/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 300 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, and PaO2 of 230 mmHg. 

The patient's lab results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 82 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 2.5 mmol/L. Her electrolytes show hypernatremia with a sodium level of 117 mg/dL, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, and hyponatremia with a chloride level of 106 mEq/L. 

The patient's medical conditions include acute respiratory failure (ARF), hypernatremia, hematuria, sedation, autoimmune hepatitis, leukopenia, asthma, diarrhea, and a tooth infection. 

Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying pneumonia and the need for continued mechanical ventilation. The patient's leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may indicate an increased risk of infection and bleeding respectively. The presence of hypernatremia and hematuria suggests potential renal involvement. Sedation may be necessary to keep the patient calm, but there is an attempt to turn down fentanyl to assess her level of consciousness. The autoimmune hepatitis requires ongoing management with specific medications, and the patient's asthma and diarrhea need to be monitored and treated accordingly. The tooth infection should be addressed once the patient is stabilized."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure (ARF) with a stable creatinine level of 1.0, hypernatremia, hematuria, and sedation. The patient is also being treated for asthma, autoimmune hepatitis, and a tooth infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures of endotracheal aspirates are necessary to detect and treat any potential infections early.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has ARF with a stable creatinine level of 1.0. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly. Monitoring renal function and adjusting treatment accordingly is essential.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, neurological complications, and electrolyte imbalances. It is crucial to manage fluid balance carefully and monitor electrolyte levels regularly.
4. Hematuria: The presence of blood in the urine can be indicative of urinary tract infection, kidney stones, or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation, including urinalysis and imaging studies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who is currently admitted to the ICU for fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia. She has been experiencing respiratory distress and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 to 118/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal impairment. Monitoring urine output and adjusting diuretic doses accordingly will be important.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which should be managed by carefully controlling fluid intake and output.
4. Hematuria: The presence of blood in the Foley catheter output should be investigated further to determine the cause, such as urinary tract infection or trauma.
5. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count may indicate an immun"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia and established ARDS. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate within normal range, slightly low blood pressure, and respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is 95% on FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,192 mL and output of 3,573 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of -381 mL. Her urine output is 2,023 mL.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a WBC count of 6.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypernatremia (Na+: 145 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (K+: 3.8 mEq/L).

Radiology shows worsening pulmonary edema and multiple opacities on the chest X-ray.

The patient's medical team is working towards extubation in the next day or two, provided she continues to tolerate a slow decrease in PEEP/PS. Antibiotics have been started, and sedation will be held in favor of using haloperidol for agitation. The team is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has multifocal pneumonia and established ARDS, which is now slowly improving. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/56 mmHg to 90/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, soft non-tender abdomen, warm extremities, and attentive mental status with purposeful movements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular chest X-rays will be necessary to detect any signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous heparin are in place.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic acid suppression therapy with PPI is being used.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is critically ill.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Dyspnea/Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or sepsis if not properly managed.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Proper management is necessary to prevent further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating a risk of dehydration and imbalances in electrolyte levels. Careful fluid management is crucial to prevent complications such as seizures or neurological abnormalities.

4. Autoimmune Hepatitis: The patient has a pre-existing condition of autoimmune hepatitis, which requires ongoing treatment and monitoring. Poorly controlled autoimmune hepatitis can lead to liver damage and complications.

5. Leukopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, which may indicate an immunocompromised state or medication effect. Close monitoring for infections and appropriate management is essential.

6. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and it is important"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. The patient has an arterial line that stopped at 03:58 AM. A left radial arterial line was placed by the physician, and the previous arterial line was stopped due to suspected infection.

2. The patient stopped taking doxycycline and is scheduled to discontinue Aztreonam tomorrow if stable. This suggests that the patient may have been receiving antibiotics for an infection.

3. The patient's sedation was decreased, and they received prn Haldol, both orally and intravenously. This indicates agitation and possible delirium or confusion.

4. The patient received Lasix at 11 am but experienced negative results, with their heart rate increasing to 110-120 beats per minute. The second dose of Lasix was delayed, and Haldol was given as agitation might be a component of tachycardia.

5. The patient developed left arm erythema, which could indicate an infection or allergic reaction.

6. The patient pulled out the foley catheter with their feet, and the balloon was inflated. The Foley catheter was replaced.

7. The patient lost an arterial line.

8. The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, aspirin, sulfa (sulfonamides), and ibuprofen. Anaphylaxis is"

- Arterial line stopped at 03:58 AM.
- Left radial arterial line placed by MD.
- Per ID, stopped doxycycline with plans to discontinue Aztreonam tomorrow if stable.
- Decreased sedation, used prn Haldol - 1 dose PO and 1 dose IV.
- Received Lasix at 11 am but HR went to 110-120s, so asked to delay second dose. Given Haldol as agitation likely a component of tachycardia.
- Following left arm erythema.
- Tularemia serology expected tomorrow.
- Patient pulled out Foley with feet, balloon inflated. Foley replaced.
- Lost A-line.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, aspirin, sulfa (sulfonamides), and ibuprofen. She also experienced anaphylaxis to ginger.

The last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 05/07/20 at 12:16 PM and Aztreonam on 05/09/20 at 04:33 AM.

Infusions include Furosemide (Lasix) on 05/08/20 at 11:30 AM and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) on 05/08/20 at 10:11 PM.

Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flowsheet data as of 05/09/20 at 05:46 AM.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), heart rate of 102 bpm (96-117 bpm), blood pressure of 109/49 mmHg (121/54-111/121 mmHg), respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (14-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus tachycardia heart rhythm. Fluid balance indicates a total intake of 1,749 mL and a total output of 1,943 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 417 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 73.

Physical examination findings include opening eyes spontaneously, not following commands, PERRL, RRR, 3/6 SEM at USB, bilateral scattered wheezes and crackles, soft abdomen with present bowel sounds, and anasarca.

Lab results show leukocyte count (WBC) of 6.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 6.9 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 92 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 38 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 145 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 5.5 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 106 mEq/L, carbon dioxide (CO2) of 21.9%, and magnesium (Mg++) of 2.4 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
- Continue aztreonam and doxycycline.
- Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) and if looks good attempt extubation.
- Follow up repeat cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral load.
- Diurese with Lasix 40mg IV bid.
- Attempt to diurese for goal of 500 cc to - 1 L.
- 5 pm lytes.
- Hypernatremia: in setting of decreased free water flushes.
- Hematuria: seen in Foley - s/p Foley change - monitor.
- Sedation: Haldol prn agitation - attempt to avoid using fentanyl/versed for sedation given plans for extubation.
- Autoimmune hepatitis: continue rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol - hold azathioprine given infection.
- Leukopenia: consider immunological compromise vs med effect, s/p.
- Asthma: continue inhalers.
- Tooth infection: panorex when stabilized.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical conditions and allergies. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute renal failure (ARF), hepatitis, leukopenia, and asthma. The patient's arterial line stopped at 03:58 AM, and a new radial arterial line was placed. She received Lasix at 11 AM but experienced tachycardia and agitation, so Haldol was given. The patient pulled out her foley catheter, and it had to be replaced. Her allergy history includes penicillins, aspirin, sulfa, ibuprofen, and ginger. The patient received vancomycin and aztreonam antibiotics but stopped taking doxycycline as per ID orders. She was on prophylactic heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current events mentioned. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.3Â°F), heart rate of 102 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 109/49 mmHg to 121/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 417"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as multifocal pneumonia and established ARDS. The patient has been slowly improving and is now planned for extubation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is a severe form of respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function after extubation.

2. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels have dropped from 25 to 22, potentially due to traumatic Foley removal. Rechecking Hct levels is recommended, and if low again, the patient may require a blood transfusion.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's Cr levels are stable, but there is a goal to keep them within normal limits. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels in the setting of decreased free water flushes. Free water flushes should be given every 6 hours while the patient is intubated.

5. Autoimmune Hepatitis: The patient has ongoing management for autoimmune hepatitis, including medications such as rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol.

6. Leukopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, which may be due to immunological compromise or medication effect. A dose of GCSF (granulocyte"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is currently in the ICU. Her condition has been slowly improving, and there is hope for extubation today. The patient has multiple medical complications, including anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), hypernatremia, autoimmune hepatitis, and leukopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 6.9 g/dL to 6.5 g/dL, indicating a drop in Hct to 22 from 25. This could be due to traumatic foley removal, and further evaluation is needed. If the anemia persists, the patient may require a blood transfusion.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are within normal range, indicating stable renal function. However, close monitoring of renal parameters is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which need to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Autoimmune Hepatitis: The patient has a known history of autoimmune hepatitis, and appropriate management with medications like rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol should be continued.
5. Leukopenia: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who presented with fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia. She has completed an antibiotic course for the unknown etiology of her pneumonia. The patient was extubated and is currently being evaluated with a nasogastric tube placed. She is also receiving 50% oxygen via a nasal cannula.

The patient has several medical conditions that require attention. These include:

1. Hematuria/Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable and does not require transfusion. However, a Foley catheter has been placed for further evaluation and management.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is most likely related to Amikacin. It has improved following the administration of Lasix and close monitoring of electrolytes.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient continues to receive free water flushes at 200 cc q4h to address her hypernatremia. Repeat evaluation in the morning is planned.

4. Confusion: The patient's confusion could be due to hepatic encephalopathy (HE) or ICU delirium. Her mental status has stabilized with an increased dose of lactulose.

5. Autoimmune hepatitis: The patient's autoimmune hepatitis requires ongoing management with rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol. Azathioprine has been held due to the recent infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. The patient has completed her antibiotic course and is being extubated today. She may need a nasogastric tube and further evaluation of micro data, especially for tularemia. The patient also has hematuria, anemia, acute kidney injury, sedation, autoimmune hepatitis, leukopenia, asthma, and a tooth infection. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's previous need for invasive ventilation and current respiratory symptoms, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of her asthma.

2. Infection-related Complications: The patient has multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology and is awaiting results for tularemia. There is a possibility of developing additional infections or experiencing complications related to these existing infections.

3. Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may progress if not properly managed. This could lead to further deterioration of renal function and potential need for dialysis.

4. Gastrointestinal Comp"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, who presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has completed an antibiotic course for multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but has been extubated. She is currently being evaluated for her symptoms, including NPO status with a nasogastric tube placed. The patient's micro data, particularly regarding tularemia, is pending. She is doing well on a 50% oxygen mask.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hematuria/Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels require close monitoring. If it falls below 21, she may require a blood transfusion. However, for now, she does not require a transfusion as her hematocrit is stable.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is most likely related to Amikacin. Since her condition has improved, further evaluation and management of her renal function should be continued.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 146 mEq/L. She is being treated with free water flushes to correct this electrolyte imbalance.

4. Confusion: The patient is experiencing confusion, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy (HE) or ICU delirium. Her mental status remains stable on an increased dose of lactulose.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with autoimmune hepatitis who has been admitted to the ICU due to multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea and was previously intubated but has now been extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and increased risk of infection.
2. ARDS: The patient has established ARDS, a severe lung condition that can result in respiratory failure and difficulty in oxygenation.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored due to the presence of ARF, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient is experiencing hypernatremia, which is an elevated level of sodium in the blood. This condition requires careful management to prevent dehydration and other complications.
5. Autoimmune Hepatitis/Cirrhosis/Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis and may have developed cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.
6. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, a decrease in white blood cell count, which can increase the risk of infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea and has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated on 5/9. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which means she has infections in multiple areas of her lungs. This condition can lead to further respiratory failure and worsening of her ARDS.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient already has ARDS, a severe lung condition that causes low oxygen levels in the blood. ARDS can progress and result in respiratory failure if not properly managed.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and may require dialysis.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. It is important to monitor and manage her fluid and electrolyte balance carefully.

5. Autoimmune hepatitis: The patient has a pre-existing condition of autoimmune hepatitis. This condition may flare up during times of stress or illness and needs to be managed with appropriate medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. She has completed her antibiotic course. She was extubated and is currently being evaluated. She is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has an NGT (nasogastric tube) placed. The plan is to re-evaluate her today and follow up on micro data, especially for Tularemia, which remains pending. She is doing well on a 50% FiO2 mask.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea/Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has completed her antibiotic course, and her condition is being monitored.
2. Hematuria/Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, and she does not require transfusion. A Foley catheter will be continued, and hand irrigation will be performed as per Urology's instructions.
3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): This is most likely related to Amikacin. The patient's condition has improved following electrolyte replacement and diuresis. She has received a dose of 40 mg Lasix already this morning. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500-1000 mL, and electrolytes will be rechecked in the morning.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient will continue receiving free water flushes at 200 cc q"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She was admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. She has completed an antibiotic course and continues to wean off oxygen as tolerated, showing significant improvement.

Medical Complications:
1. Hematuria/Anemia: The patient has anemia and hematuria, for which transfusion is recommended for hemoglobin levels below 21 g/dL. A two-way foley catheter and manual irrigation have been placed per urology recommendation.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is believed to be related to Amikacin. There has been improvement, and the goal is to maintain even intake/output balance.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and the plan is to increase free water flushes to 250 mL every 4 hours from 200 mL every 4 hours.
4. Confusion: The patient's confusion has improved with lactulose treatment.
5. Autoimmune Hepatitis: The patient continues to receive rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol for her autoimmune hepatitis. Azathioprine has been temporarily stopped due to the recent infection.
6. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia has resolved after discontinuing azathioprine.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who is currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. The patient has completed her antibiotic course and is extubated. She has been placed on NPO status with a NGT (nasogastric tube) and will be re-evaluated today.

The patient also has hematuria and anemia, but her hematocrit is stable and does not require transfusion. She will continue with Foley catheterization but does not require continuous bladder irrigation.

The patient is experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), which is most likely related to Amikacin. Her electrolytes will be rechecked in the morning, and she has received a dose of Lasix already this morning to promote diuresis and achieve a negative fluid balance of 500-1000 mL.

Hypernatremia is also present, and the patient will continue with free water flushes at 200 cc q4h. Mental status changes are being evaluated for possible hepatic encephalopathy (HE) versus ICU delirium. The patient's confusion has stabilized on an increased lactulose dose.

Regarding her medical conditions, the patient has autoimmune hepatitis and will continue with rifaximin, lactulose, and ursodiol. Azathioprine has been held due to the recent infection. Leukopenia has resolved"

   Disposition : Floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with fever, cough, and dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was initially intubated but was extubated on [**5-9**]. She is currently stable on a few liters of supplemental oxygen.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient may experience confusion or delirium due to her underlying medical conditions, infections, or medications.

2. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient may have difficulties with nutrition due to her inability to eat normally, which can be further complicated by her planned video and barium swallow evaluations.

3. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, as indicated by her elevated creatinine levels and urine output. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance and electrolytes will be necessary.

4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has established ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. She will require close monitoring of her respiratory status and ongoing support with supplemental oxygen.

5. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Community Acquired (CAP): The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Completion of the antibiotic course is essential"
