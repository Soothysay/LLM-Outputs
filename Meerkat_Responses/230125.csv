","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), currently admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent an ultrasound and trans-thoracic echo on [**2128-10-15**] at 09:08 AM and 11:09 AM, respectively. The results showed no deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), moderate right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis, and biatrial enlargement. The renal ultrasound was also complete. The patient is on Plavix and aspirin (ASA) for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but not on heparin. There are no new thoracic recommendations. The patient's fractional excretion of sodium (FENA) is less than 1, and they tested positive for monospot and negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV). The patient has allergies to oxycodone and Zanaflex (Oral) (Tizanidine Hcl), with reported side effects of dizziness and hypotension, respectively. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently receiving ICU medications and other medications. There have been no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   # Resolved hypotension: Still unclear etiology and differential is
   still broad as per admission note.  Pt responded to fluid and is
   currently normotensive.  Differential for shock includes hypovolemia,
   cardiogenic (unlikely given response with fluids), distributive
   (unlikely given pt is afebrile, normal WBC), obstructive

   - f/u LENIs to look for DVT
   - tx for NSTEMI and possible PE with heparin gtt
   - hold off on CTA for now given already being treated with heparin gtt
   .
   # Resolved hypoxia: Patient now at baseline oxygenation. CT chest
   showed atelectasis no infiltrate. Pt also does not have fever or sputum
   production to suggest PNA although WBC is slightly elevated with left
   shift. CTA could not be performed given ARF. The patient does have hx
   severe diastolic heart failure and elvated BNP, but there is no
   pulmonary edema, JVD or crackles on exam to suggest volume overload at
   this time.

   - hold off on abx
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST and ALT elevated w/o rise in alk phos or bili. RUQ
   unrevealing. INR 1.8  suggesting coagulopathy. The patient had a very
   similar episode of hypotension, renal failure and transaminitis in
   [**2128-3-16**] in which he was diagnosed with shock liver. Viral hepatitis
   can elevated AST/ALT to this extent. Medication overdose, tylenol may
   cause transaminitis.  Tylenol and tox screen negative.  LFTs trending
   down.
   - trend LFT's
   - f/u viral serologies: hepatitis, EBV, CMV
   - hold statin

   # NSTEMI: Trop 0.60, CKD 258 and EKG with worsening TWI and ST
   depressions suggesting ACS although MB is low. It is also possible that
   troponin is elevated in the setting of renal failure.  Enzymes cycled
   and CK peaked at 477.  Will not continue to trend.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, there are several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed.

1. The patient underwent a transthoracic echo which showed moderate right ventricular hypokinesis and biatrial enlargement. This suggests possible cardiac dysfunction or strain.

2. The patient has a history of NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) and is currently on Plavix and ASA. The Troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. It is important to monitor the EKG and continue with antiplatelet therapy.

3. The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and a FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) of 0.6%. This suggests intrinsic renal damage. The plan is to continue with fluid resuscitation and follow-up renal ultrasound.

4. The patient has elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), suggestive of transaminitis. This could be due to viral hepatitis or medication overdose. Viral serologies for hepatitis, EBV, and CMV should be followed up, and statin therapy should be held.

5. The patient has a history of severe diastolic heart failure, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, but no signs of volume overload such as pulmonary edema or jugular venous distention. Further investigation into the cause of hypoxia and consideration for a"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent a series of tests and procedures including ultrasound, trans-thoracic echo, CTA, and NSTEMI.
- The patient has a history of severe diastolic heart failure and elevated BNP but currently does not show signs of volume overload.
- The patient experienced hypotension that was initially unclear in etiology but responded to fluids and resumed normal home anti-hypertensive regimen.
- The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 90%.
- Physical examination reveals scattered crackles bilaterally, well-healing wounds with bruising and tenderness, lower abdominal hematoma, and no rashes or focal neurologic deficits.
- Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests (elevated AST and ALT).
- The patient has a history of COPD, lung cancer, seizure, PE/DVT, and recent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery).
- The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, ASA, Plavix, heparin, Keppra, and others.
- The patient's disposition is pending further work-up and treatment, and they may be called to the floor later today if stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient's past medical history includes COPD, lung cancer, seizure disorder, and a history of PE/DVT. 

24-hour events include an ultrasound and trans-thoracic echo. The echo results showed moderate right ventricular hypokinesis, biatrial enlargement, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed, revealing a moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis of the adjacent lung, bilateral renal hypodensities, extensive atheromatous disease of the abdominal aorta, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. 

The patient has allergies to oxycodone and Zanaflex. The last dose of antibiotics was administered. Infusions and other ICU medications are documented. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 92 kg.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,558 mL, with outputs totaling 2,590 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 968 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG pending. Physical examination"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of left lower lobe lung cancer, admitted with high oxygen requirements and hypoxemia. The patient had transient hot nodules leading to shock liver/mild acute tubular necrosis. The patient has been improving with ICU care and is now showing signs of recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization: The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, which increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Infection: Due to the invasive nature of ICU care and prolonged hospital stay, there is an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and chronic systolic heart failure, there is a potential risk of cardiac events like arrhythmias or worsening heart failure.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient experienced shock liver previously, and there is a possibility of ongoing liver dysfunction.
5. Renal impairment: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and there is a potential for further renal impairment.
6. Respiratory issues: The patient's hypoxemia indicates underlying respiratory problems that may persist or worsen.
7. Pressure injuries: Immobility in the ICU can lead to pressure injuries, especially in areas of prolonged contact with the bed or chair.
8. Malnutrition: Prol"
