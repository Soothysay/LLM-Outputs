","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and recent NSTEMI. She was admitted with multiple episodes of BRBPR (blood-tinged or brownish red blood per rectum), which suggests lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of diverticula and rectal ulceration on prior colonoscopy, making these conditions possible sources of the bleeding. Although less likely, the patient also uses ibuprofen for arthritis, which can contribute to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/81 mmHg to 172/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is currently on respiratory support with no oxygen delivery device. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 209 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels decreasing from 27.2% to 25.0%, platelet count (Plt) at 209, creatinine (Cr) at 0.9 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels below 0.01. Other lab values indicate normal potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), bicarbonate (HCO3), BUN, glucose, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and phosphate (PO4) levels. 

The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal range, indicating no active cardiac ischemia at the moment. However, she had elevated cardiac enzymes during her prior admission. 

Plan and Assessment:
The patient requires close monitoring and management for her conditions. For the gastrointestinal bleeding, she will be maintained on two 18-gauge peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, with a type and crossmatch (T&C) ordered and two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfused. Her hemoglobin levels will be rechecked four hours after the blood transfusion and checked every six hours thereafter. The patient is also prepared for a colonoscopy tomorrow, starting golytely preparation this afternoon, and will be NPO (nothing by mouth) after midnight. If the patient experiences large-volume bleeding or becomes unstable, a bleeding scan and possible angiography may be planned. 

Regarding the recent NSTEMI, the patient will have repeat cardiac enzyme measurements with the evening Hct and an EKG tomorrow morning. She is being transfused with a goal Hct of 28. 

For her type 2 diabetes, the patient's home metformin will be held during hospitalization, and she will be managed with sliding scale insulin and fingerstick glucose measurements four times daily. 

As for her hypertension, the patient's current outpatient medications include toprol XL and cozaar. Beta"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 y/o woman with PMH notable for type 2 DM, hypertension,
   and recent NSTEMI in setting of hypoglycemia admitted with multiple
   episodes of BRBPR.
   .
   # GI bleeding: Appears to be lower GI bleeding given history. The
   patient does have multiple diverticula on prior colonoscopy, making
   this the most likely source. She also had rectal ulceration in prior
   colonoscopy and rectal pain could correlate with a recurrence of this.
   Less likely is upper GI bleeding but does use ibuprofen for arthritis
   at times.
   - maintain 2 18 g PIVs
   - active T&C, 2 U PRBCs ordered in the ED
   - recheck hct 4 hours after blood complete & q6h therafter
   - appreciate GI input
   - prep for colonoscopy tomorrow, golytely starting this afternoon
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - clears this afternoon, NPO after midnight
   - if large volume bleeding or patient unstable, plan for transfusion
   and will likely need bleeding scan/possible angio
   .
   # Recent NSTEMI: Patient had cardiac enzyme elevation on prior
   admission. EKG unchanged on arrival and no overt symptoms of ischemia.
   Getting transfused with goal Hct 28.
   - repeat CEs with evening Hct
   - ekg tomorrow am
   - hold aspirin for now
   - hold beta blocker so that tachycardia not masked
   - continue pravastatin
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Hold home metformin while hospitalized.
   - sliding scale insulin & fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient on toprol XL and cozaar as outpatient.
   - hold beta blocker
   - if persistently hypertension, could restart cozaar, potentially at
   lower dose

There is also a history of rectal ulceration, which could correlate with a recurrence. She uses ibuprofen for arthritis at times, which may contribute to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,911 mL total input and 1,460 mL total output with a difference of 451 mL. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.0 K/uL, hematocrit of 27.2% and 25.0%, platelet count of 209 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin T of less than 0.01 ng/mL, glucose of 194 mg/dL, and other labs including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and electrolyte levels.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and recent NSTEMI. She was admitted with multiple episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR). The patient did not complete her GI prep and decided to stop a tagged red cell scan early, limiting the study results. She refused to drink enough Go lytely for a colonoscopy, resulting in an increased hematocrit level of 34. The patient also refused blood draws. She has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, and a bleeding scan was ordered instead of a colonoscopy. The patient received 2 additional units of blood. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/63 mmHg to 90/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has trace edema in both lower extremities with delayed pulses bilaterally. The physical examination shows clear lungs, soft abdomen with bowel sounds, and warm extremities. The patient's neurological examination is normal. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. Her glucose level is high, and other lab values indicate potential electrolyte imbalances. The patient's assessment includes gastrointestinal bleeding, type 2 diabetes, recent NSTEMI, and ineffective coping/knowledge deficit. The plan includes transfusing blood for hematocrit below 28, holding aspirin and beta-blocker temporarily, continuing pravastatin, and adjusting medications for diabetes and hypertension. The patient's code status is full code."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical complications. She has a history of allergies to ace inhibitors and cough, as well as a last dose of antibiotics. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to ineffective coping, knowledge deficit, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She also has diabetes mellitus type II. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but her hemodynamic monitoring shows some fluctuations in blood pressure. She is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and antibiotics. The patient has received blood products and has an increased hematocrit level of 34.4%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with oxygen delivery at 96%. The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, while troponin-T and glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's kidney function appears to be compromised, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Assessment and plan include ineffective coping, knowledge deficit, gastrointestinal bleeding, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 y/o woman with PMH notable for type 2 DM, hypertension,
   and recent NSTEMI in setting of hypoglycemia admitted with multiple
   episodes of BRBPR.
   .
   # GI bleeding: Decreased melanotic stools overnight but continues to
   have hematocrit drops. Since the patient did not complete her GI prep
   will not get colonoscopy today, but will instead order bleeding scan
   given her persistent anemia despite 3U blood. Currently getting 2 more
   units this AM.
   - maintain 2 18 g PIVs
   - recheck hct 4 hrs post 2^nd unti
   - bleeding scan
   - f/u GI recs for today
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - NPO
   .
   # Recent NSTEMI: Patient had cardiac enzyme elevation on prior
   admission. EKG unchanged on arrival and no overt symptoms of ischemia.
   CE negative
   - transfuse for hct<28
   - hold aspirin for now
   - hold beta blocker so that tachycardia not masked
   - continue pravastatin
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Hold home metformin while hospitalized. Elevated blood
   sugars overnight.
   - increase sliding scale insulin & fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Hypertension: Normotensive overnight for the most part. Patient on
   toprol XL and cozaar as outpatient.
   - hold beta blocker
   - if persistently hypertension, could restart cozaar, potentially at
   lower dose
   .
   # FEN: NPO, clears this afternoon, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # CODE: full, confirmed with daughter who is HCP
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. daughter [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2780**]is HCP, ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2781**] home, ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2782**] cell; son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 74**] (works at [**Hospital1 1**])
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2783**] cell, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1087**] home.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and a recent NSTEMI. She was admitted with multiple episodes of BRBPR, which has been interpreted as gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been dropping, and she is currently receiving 2 units of blood. A tagged red cell scan was planned to investigate the source of bleeding, but the patient only completed half of the study and refused to continue. She also refused to drink the Go lytely solution for the colonoscopy preparation. Her HCT increased to 34%. The patient is refusing blood draws this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's presentation with BRBPR and decreasing hemoglobin levels suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. If not properly managed, this can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.

2. Anemia: Due to the ongoing blood loss and incomplete tagged red cell scan, the patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to vital organs.

3. Infection: The patient's prolonged NPO status increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Additionally, the use of invasive lines and procedures can introduce infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections.

4. Cardiac Ischemia: Although the patient had a recent NSTEMI, her current EKG is unchanged, and there are no symptoms"
