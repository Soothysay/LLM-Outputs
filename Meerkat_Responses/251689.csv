","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 92-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has been experiencing fever, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He is currently on invasive ventilation, multi lumen access, and arterial line access. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/72 to 91/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is unresponsive to commands and has not been assessed for movement, tone, or skin condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation with fever and septic shock indicates a severe infection causing systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic parameters, and organ function is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation must be maintained to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Daily evaluation of lung function through arterial blood gas analysis and chest X-rays should be considered to assess the progress of respiratory failure and guide weaning from mechanical ventilation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine and urea levels suggest acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function through laboratory tests and urine output measurement is"

   .
   # Septic Shock - Etiologies include gastroenteritis (viral and
   bacterial), aspiration pneumonia, biliary source, endocarditis. UA
   negative at OSH. CXR more concerning for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs.
   infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast
   unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use. No clear
   obstructive component but may have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission.
   - cover broadly for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV cefepime,
   flagyl, azithro
   - check [**Last Name (un) 1743**]
   - send stool for infectious diarrhea
   - f/u blood and urine cultures, send sputum
   - trend lactate, check SvO2 if remains hypotensive
   - bolus to CVP >12, transition off of dopamine to levophed with goal
   MAP >65
   - given home hydrocortisone, will start stress dose steroids
   - place A-line
   - consider RUQ if lactate non-responsive to fluids, pressors
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - Patient required intubation in setting
   of lying flat with line placement. CXR consistent with volume overload,
   EF unknown.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - cycle cardiac enzymes, ECHO in am
   .
   # Emesis - As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - stool cultues sent
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds

   # Acute Renal Failure - Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit.
   Discussed with wife that recently hydrocort/ketaconazole were resumed
   and she was concerned that these caused renal impairment in past. Like

   last check [**1-24**] initiation of ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO/cycle enzymes as above
   .
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of recent hospitalization, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, and on coumadin therapy. He presented with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be important in detecting this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy should be continued to reduce this risk.

3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and the use of corticosteroids increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylactic H2 blocker therapy should be continued to prevent this complication.

4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections. Regular surveillance cultures and appropriate antim"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - stool cultues sent
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Prerenal less likely since
   UOP improved and creatinine unchanged. Likely ATN [**1-24**] hypotension. Also
   restarted hydrocort/ketaconazole recently.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. Per wife INR 7.5 on last check [**1-24**] initiation of
   ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CHB) pacemaker dependence, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone presenting with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He was previously on coumadin and had an INR of 7.5 on the day of admission. The patient has multiple comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, which may contribute to the development of complications during his ICU stay.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation with chills and vomiting followed by septic shock suggests a possible gastrointestinal source of infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the causative organism and determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3, which increased to 1.7 on admission. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a concern, possibly due to hypotension. Frequent assessment of renal function and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents are recommended.

4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated"

   76 yo M w/ [**Doctor Last Name 4969**] on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Prerenal less likely since
   UOP improved and creatinine unchanged. Likely ATN [**1-24**] hypotension. Also
   restarted hydrocort/ketaconazole recently.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # [**Month/Day (2) 4969**]/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. Per wife INR 7.5 on last check [**1-24**] initiation of
   ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

   Meds notable for levophed, cefepime, flagyl, azithro; hydrocort.
   Off fentanyl and versed as of 8am.
   76 y/o with septic shock, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory
   failure.
   Agree with plan to continue to treat broadly for sepsis of unclear
   etiology, signs of improvement with lactate decreasing, pressor
   requirement decreasing.  Continue to wean pressors, and give stress
   does steroids.  Await cultures from OSH and here.
   Will obtain echo here given [**Hospital1 4969**], shock, though by Vigileo stroke volume
   appears to be adequate, relatively bradycardic.  Sedation now off, plan
   for PSV and SBT depending on mental status.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone presenting with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He has multiple comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. The patient was initially on dopamine and later transitioned to levophed for hemodynamic support. His lactate levels have been trending down. Imaging studies show evidence of pulmonary edema and volume overload, raising concerns for aspiration pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The source of sepsis is unclear, but there are concerns for gastrointestinal, aspiration, biliary, or endocarditis sources. The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 and currently at 1.7. His platelet count is mildly decreased. The patient's medical team is treating him with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care. He is currently intubated and sedated, and plans are being made for weaning sedation and transitioning to spontaneous breathing trials depending on his mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock indicates a systemic infection. The source of infection is unclear, but there are multiple potential sources including gastrointestinal, aspiration, biliary, or endocarditis."

   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now

   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, AFib, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone presenting from home with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. There are concerns for aspiration pneumonia, biliary source, endocarditis, and cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission. The patient's lactate is trending down, and CEs are negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock indicates a potential infection causing systemic inflammation leading to shock. Presumably GI source from history, possibly aspiration pneumonia, biliary source, endocarditis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. It is also a concern for aspiration pneumonia given emesis and question of opacity on CXR.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine of 1.3, up to 1.7 on admit, and recent hypotension suggest acute renal failure, likely ATN.
4. Emesis: Aspiration pneumonia is a concern due to the emesis and the possibility of an obstruction.
5. Elevated LFTs: Liver function tests are elevated, which could be due to shock liver or"

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably urinary source given positive urine cultures with group B
   strep and e. coli. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out
   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - wean steroids to 50mg IV Q8H
   - f/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Delerium: No focal findings, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] nature most c/w
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent
   septic shock.
   - Weaning down steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   - Call out to floor may benefit pt
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; Resolved. 96% on RA.
   # Anemia: Consider hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili normal and
   LD trending down, consider GI bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. Possibly [**1-24**] sepsis vs viral gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - holding coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - Recheck HCT
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   Improving. CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of mechanical valve replacement, chronic heart block, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer on hydrocortisone, presenting with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, delirium, hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia, emesis, and elevated liver function tests. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening septic shock, development of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), further deterioration of renal function leading to acute kidney injury, progression of respiratory failure potentially requiring reintubation, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, and potential adverse effects of medications such as bleeding or hemorrhage due to the patient's elevated INR.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, oxygenation, and laboratory values. Frequent reassessment of the patient's mental status and respiratory status is necessary. Prompt identification and management of any new complications or deterioration in the patient's condition is crucial."

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of prosthetic aortic valve (AVR) on coumadin, chronic heart block (CHB) pacer dependent, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone presenting from home with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient required intubation in the setting of lying flat with line placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now 40%. There is also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity on CXR. CXR today is clear suggesting this was pulmonary edema and unlikely pulmonary source of infection.

The patient's current medications include cefepime, flagyl, famotidine (Pepcid), and hydrocortisone. The patient has been weaned off steroids and is now receiving IV fluids to keep CVP > 12. Broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV cefepime, flagyl is continued. The patient's cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine) are being followed up, and contact with OSH has been made for culture data.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine level, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. The patient's INR is still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o bleed, but downtrending HCT.

The patient's imaging shows progressive heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung, which could be due to a combination of pneumonia and increasing moderate left pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion and borderline pulmonary edema have been present for several days, and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to septic shock, pneumonia, and aspiration. There is a concern for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) given the patient's clinical exam on admission, but it has been ruled out. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the FiO2 has been weaned to 40%. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and respiratory status is essential.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased from 1.3 to 1.7 on admission, which indicates acute renal failure. The cause of renal failure is likely prerenal due to septic shock and dehydration. However, the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) should be considered. Close monitoring of the patient's urine output and creatinine levels is necessary.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is mildly decreased. DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) labs are negative, so other causes such as seps"

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name2 (NI) **] for culture data
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Anemia: Likely hemodilutional, consider GI bleed, hemolysis although
   T bili and LD normal
   - Check hapto
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of mechanical aortic valve replacement, chronic heart failure, pacemaker dependence, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone presenting with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Shock, Septic: Presumably gastrointestinal source, possibly aspiration pneumonia, biliary source, or endocarditis. The patient was on dopamine and later transitioned to levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Lactate levels are trending down, and cultures are being followed up.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to lying flat with line placement. CXR shows signs of volume overload, and there is a concern for aspiration given emesis and opacity on CXR. FiO2 is now at 40%. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

3. Anemia: Likely hemodilutional, with a consideration for GI bleed or hemolysis. Further investigations are needed to confirm the cause, including checking haptoglobin levels, performing a Guaiac test on stools, and maintaining active fluid resuscitation.

4. Emesis: Aspiration pneumonia is a concern due to the presence of emesis and findings on CXR. Stool cultures and other cultures are pending.

The patient is a 92-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. The patient required invasive ventilation and an arterial line, both of which were stopped. The patient's INR goal is 2.5-3.5 for mechanical valve, and there is increased redness in the lower extremities, so TEDs were removed. The patient tolerated pressure support and underwent a successful spontaneous breathing trial, resulting in extubation without complications. Urine electrolytes show feNa 0.2%, suggesting a prerenal etiology. An echo order has been placed. The patient's allergies include morphine, nausea/vomiting, and azithromycin. Antibiotics include cefepime and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/54 mmHg to 167/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 91.3 kg. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 10 mmHg, total input of 1,417 mL, total output of 1,125 mL, and fluid balance of -292 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and SpO2"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-19**]
   - Urine cultures also growing group B strep
   - Pt in florrid delerium, AOx0 and agitated thought to be steroid
   induced delerium, with concominant toxic metabolic and ICU delerium
   contributing. He's currently on 2-4mg haldol IV TID PRN agitation,
   requiring restraints. This was later increased to 4-6mg haldol IV TID
   PRN. QTC on tele remained stable, attempted to get 12 lead w/o success.
   - Pt became hypertensive to 190s during agitation for a few minutes,
   was given hydral IV ONCE to good affect
   - We are weaning off his steroids going from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV
   Q8H
   - Restarted his home lasix of 40mg PO Daily
   - Nurses concerned he was volume overloaded slightly as was net +
   600ccs, new rhales, and CVP 15-19. Was given an additional 20mg IV
   lasix ONCE
   -Still wheezy, agitated, ?dyspneic and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix ONCE
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   -Hypertension returned to 160s systolic, was started on hydralazine 5mg
   IV Q6H as home lisinopril may worsen resolving ARF.
   -Stopped steroids as this was thought to be the cause of his delerium
   -Having continued dyspnea and upper airway sounds, likely secondary to
   agitation but possibility of laryngospasm. Apparently haldol can do
   this, so stopping Haldol and switching to zyprexa PRN.
   -Gave benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise, (less likely, and more likely secondary
   to agitation)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 92-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. He has been in the ICU for several days and is experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's urine cultures have grown group B strep, and he is showing signs of agitation and delirium, which may be steroid-induced. He is currently on haloperidol (Haldol) IV TID PRN for agitation, requiring restraints. His steroids are being weaned off from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, reaching 190s during agitation and then returning to 160s systolic. He was given hydralazine IV ONCE to manage the hypertension. The patient also developed right conjunctival hemorrhage likely due to elevated INR and possibly hypertension. His respiratory status remains concerning with ongoing dyspnea and upper airway sounds, possibly secondary to agitation or laryngospasm. Haldol has been stopped, and olanzapine (Zyprexa) PRN has been started.

The patient's fluid balance is positive by 600ccs, and he has new rhales and a CVP of 15-19. He was given an additional 20mg IV lasix ONCE and then another 40mg IV Lasix ONCE due to ongoing wheezing, agitation, and possibly dyspnea. His heart rate is"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-19**]
   - Urine cultures also growing group B strep
   - Pt in florrid delerium, AOx0 and agitated thought to be steroid
   induced delerium, with concominant toxic metabolic and ICU delerium
   contributing. He's currently on 2-4mg haldol IV TID PRN agitation,
   requiring restraints. This was later increased to 4-6mg haldol IV TID
   PRN. QTC on tele remained stable, attempted to get 12 lead w/o success.
   - Pt became hypertensive to 190s during agitation for a few minutes,
   was given hydral IV ONCE to good affect
   - We are weaning off his steroids going from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV
   Q8H
   - Restarted his home lasix of 40mg PO Daily
   - Nurses concerned he was volume overloaded slightly as was net +
   600ccs, new rhales, and CVP 15-19. Was given an additional 20mg IV
   lasix ONCE
   -Still wheezy, agitated, ?dyspneic and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix ONCE
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   -Hypertension returned to 160s systolic, was started on hydralazine 5mg
   IV Q6H as home lisinopril may worsen resolving ARF.
   -Stopped steroids as this was thought to be the cause of his delerium
   -Having continued dyspnea and upper airway sounds, likely secondary to
   agitation but possibility of laryngospasm. Apparently haldol can do
   this, so stopping Haldol and switching to zyprexa PRN.
   -Gave benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise, (less likely, and more likely secondary
   to agitation)

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive urine cultures with
   group B strep and e. coli. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out
   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - wean steroids to 50mg IV Q8H
   - f/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Delerium: No focal findings, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] nature most c/w
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent
   septic shock.
   - Stopped steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   - Call out to floor may benefit pt
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; Resolved. 96% on RA.
   # Anemia: Consider hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili normal and
   LD trending down, consider GI bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. Possibly [**1-24**] sepsis vs viral gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - holding coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - Recheck HCT
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   Improving. CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone who presented with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has resolved septic shock, but still experiences delirium, hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia, emesis, acute renal failure, and elevated liver function tests. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for an abdominal source and pneumonia, and weaning off steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is likely caused by a combination of factors including steroid-induced delirium, toxic metabolic state, and ICU delirium. Frequent reorientation and stopping steroids may help resolve this condition.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient had hypoxic respiratory failure but has resolved it. Maintaining oxygen saturation above 96% on room air is crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could be due to hemolysis or gastrointestinal bleeding. Rechecking hematocrit levels, stool guaiac testing, and evaluating for hemolysis are important to determine the cause.
4. Emesis: The patient experienced emesis, possibly due to sepsis or viral gastroenteritis. Sending stool for testing and providing antiemetic medication as needed can help manage this symptom"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine cultures grew GBS
   - Patient in agitated delirium, A&Ox0, thought to be multifactorial,
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium
   - Steroids initially weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H, but
   ultimately held overnight [**1-24**] delirium
   - Placed on 4-6mg Haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTc on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.
   - Patient became hypertensive to 190s during agitation, resolved with
   Hydralazine x 1, but hypertension returned later in the night to 160
   placed on standing Hydralazine 5mg IV q6H
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix x 1
   - Continued to have dyspnea and upper airway sounds, thought to be from
   agitation vs laryngospasm, so Haldol was switched to Zyprexa PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement (AVR) on coumadin, congestive heart failure (CHF) paced dependent, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented to the hospital with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is now resolving.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and thought to be multifactorial, possibly due to steroid-induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium. The physician has started the patient on Zyprexa PRN to manage agitation.

2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is still elevated at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5), which is concerning for bleeding, such as conjunctival hemorrhage. The physician has decided to continue holding Coumadin and closely monitor for visual changes and other sources of bleeding. Daily HCT and ECHO to evaluate EF/? New wall motion abnormality will also be done.

3. Septic Shock: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, there is a concern for a urinary source given the positive Gram-negative bacilli (GBS) and E. coli urine cultures. The physician has continued broad coverage for an abdominal source and pneumonia with IV Cefepime, and Flagyl will be started"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine cultures grew GBS
   - Patient in agitated delirium, A&Ox0, thought to be multifactorial,
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium
   - Steroids initially weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H, but
   ultimately held overnight [**1-24**] delirium
   - Placed on 4-6mg Haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTc on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.
   - Patient became hypertensive to 190s during agitation, resolved with
   Hydralazine x 1, but hypertension returned later in the night to 160
   placed on standing Hydralazine 5mg IV q6H
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix x 1
   - Continued to have dyspnea and upper airway sounds, thought to be from
   agitation vs laryngospasm, so Haldol was switched to Zyprexa PRN
   -Gave Benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement, chronic heart block, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented to the hospital with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition.

1. Delirium: The patient is agitated and experiencing delirium, which may be caused by steroid-induced effects, toxic metabolic disturbances, or ICU delirium. It is important to manage his agitation with Zyprexa PRN and provide frequent reorientation.

2. Hypertension: The patient has had episodes of high blood pressure during agitation, which has been managed with Hydralazine. It is important to monitor his blood pressure closely and adjust the medication as needed.

3. Conjunctival hemorrhage: The patient developed a right conjunctival hemorrhage, likely secondary to an elevated INR and possibly from hypertension. No visual deficits were noted. Close monitoring of the conjunctival hemorrhage and adjustment of anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.

4. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3, and it increased to 1.7 on admission. Currently, the creatinine is 1.4, although acute tubular necrosis (ATN) has not been ruled out. It is important to trend BUN/Cr and avoid nephro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement (AVR) and chronic heart failure (CHB), dependent on a cardiac pacemaker, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer on hydrocortisone presenting with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's initial presentation was likely due to septic shock, possibly from a urinary tract infection (UTI) as indicated by positive urine cultures with group B strep and E. coli. The patient also had an elevated temperature and tachycardia.

The patient's condition has improved over time with the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (IV cefepime and flagyl) and supportive care. However, the patient continues to experience delirium, which may be attributed to steroid-induced effects or toxic metabolic disturbances in the setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock. The patient's agitation and possible dyspnea have led to the use of antipsychotic medications (Haldol and Zyprexa) and restraints.

The patient's respiratory support has been gradually reduced, transitioning from mechanical ventilation (extubated) to supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. His pulmonary edema has cleared, but moderate cardiomegaly is noted on imaging.

Other medical complications that could arise include:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3, which has improved to 1."

","The patient's chief complaint is pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing delirium, which may be multifactorial in nature, possibly due to steroid-induced effects, toxic metabolic causes, or ICU delirium. The patient is being treated with haloperidol (Haldol) IV TID PRN and restraints. 

The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, with readings ranging from 136/77 mmHg to 190s. An additional dose of hydralazine was given to manage the hypertension. 

The patient has developed conjunctival hemorrhage, likely secondary to elevated INR and possibly hypertension. 

The patient is still wheezing, agitated, and possibly dyspneic. Another dose of Lasix was administered due to ongoing positive fluid balance and rales. 

The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen, with an SpO2 of 96%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.22, indicating respiratory acidosis. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a heart rhythm of ventricular paced, with a CVP of 13-19 mmHg. Peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, neurologic examination, and other assessments are not documented.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count at 15.6 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin at 12.9 g/dL, elevated troponin-T at 0.02 mg/dL, and moderately elevated CRP at 31"

   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - F/U ECHO to evaluate EF/? New wall motion abnormality
   - Pull central line
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures. Afebrile, downtrending WBC, not requiring
   pressors. Unconcerning abdominal imaging at OSH. Patient w/ h/o
   urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years ago.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is improving, but he remains delirious, hypertensive, and has an elevated INR. He has been weaned off steroids and is receiving haloperidol (Haldol) and olanzapine (Zyprexa) for agitation. His respiratory distress has resolved, but he is wheezy with rales. He has a urinary tract infection with growth of group B streptococcus (GBS) and E. coli. The patient's other medical issues include anemia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, thrombocytopenia, and prostate cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is still experiencing delirium, which may be caused by a combination of factors such as steroid-induced delirium, toxic metabolic encephalopathy, or ICU delirium. Frequent reorientation and use of antipsychotic medication like Zyprexa may help manage this condition.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is still elevated at 5.8, putting him at risk for bleeding. Coumadin should be held, and the patient should be monitored"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine cultures grew GBS
   - Patient in agitated delirium, A&Ox0, thought to be multifactorial,
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium
   - Steroids initially weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H, but
   ultimately held overnight [**1-24**] delirium
   - Placed on 4-6mg Haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTc on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.
   - Patient became hypertensive to 190s during agitation, resolved with
   Hydralazine x 1, but hypertension returned later in the night to 160
   placed on standing Hydralazine 5mg IV q6H
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix x 1
   - Continued to have dyspnea and upper airway sounds, thought to be from
   agitation vs laryngospasm, so Haldol was switched to Zyprexa PRN
   -Gave Benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR) on coumadin, chronic heart failure (CHF) with a pacemaker, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone.

Management includes the use of Zyprexa PRN for agitation, restarting home steroids, considering holding zofran, frequent reorientation, and pulling A-line and PIV.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is still elevated at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5) with evidence of conjunctival hemorrhage. This could lead to bleeding complications. Management includes continuing to hold Coumadin, monitoring for visual changes and other sources of bleeding, daily HCT, and a follow-up echocardiogram to evaluate ejection fraction and any new wall motion abnormality. Central line should also be pulled.

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive urine cultures with
   group B strep and e. coli. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out
   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - wean steroids to 50mg IV Q8H
   - f/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Delerium: No focal findings, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] nature most c/w
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent
   septic shock.
   - Stopped steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   - Call out to floor may benefit pt
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; Resolved. 96% on RA.
   # Anemia: Consider hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili normal and
   LD trending down, consider GI bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. Possibly [**1-24**] sepsis vs viral gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent

   - holding coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - Recheck HCT
   - check ECHO

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement (AVR), chronic heart failure (CHB), atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU for several days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which has resolved. However, there is still concern for a urinary source of infection given positive urine cultures with group B strep and E. coli. Broad coverage antibiotics are being continued to address this.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, most likely due to steroid-induced or toxic metabolic causes in the setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock. Steroids have been stopped, and reorientation is being frequently performed.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient had hypoxic respiratory failure, which has since resolved. He is currently on room air (RA) at 96%.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, with a low hematocrit (HCT) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Hemolysis is a consideration, but further evaluation is needed to confirm this. Other causes, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, should also be considered.
5. Emesis: The patient had episodes of vomiting, possibly due to sepsis or viral"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 149/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, total intake of 1,450 mL, and total output of 2,215 mL with a negative fluid balance of -765 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, overweight/obese, no acute distress, and no signs of pallor or scleral edema. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, S3, or S4. The respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with crackles bilaterally. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There is trace edema in both lower extremities. The neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement.

The laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L. The blood cultures obtained on [**2130-2-17**] at 05:09 PM, 08:28 PM, and 09:07 PM, as well as [**2130-2-18**] at 04:04 AM and 06:29 AM, [**2130-2-19**] at 03:54 AM and 12:38 PM, and [**2130-2-20**] at 04:30 AM remain negative. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.22 with respiratory acidosis.

The assessment and plan include shock, septic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and ongoing efforts to identify the source of sepsis. The patient's INR remains substantially prolonged, and there is a concern for further complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is being managed with ICU care, including glycemic control, prophylaxis for stress ulcers, and systemic anticoagulation for DVT prevention."

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old male admitted to the ICU with somnolence. The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, septic shock, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute renal failure. The patient's medical history includes morphine allergy, nausea/vomiting, and a previous admission. The patient is currently on antibiotics (Vanc), furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/72 to 174/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurologic assessment shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, with movement and tone not assessed. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal troponin T levels. Radiology imaging, including an MRA of the neck and brain, as well as an EEG, are pending. The patient has been diagnosed with a respiratory infection, specifically Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive and budding yeast"

   ECHO: [**2130-2-20**]:
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen. There is an aortic prosthesis - which appears most likely a
   bioprosthesis. The gradient is higher than expected for this kind of
   prosthesis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock, much improved
   today.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restarted home steroids yesterday (hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q
   PM)
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pulled A-line, D/C foley once good diuresis acheieved and no longer
   in need of close UOP monitoring.
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Will need to monitor coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is
   restarted on d/c.
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**4-1**]
   - Restarted Hydrocortisone [**2130-2-20**].
   - Respiratory viral culture negative.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] course.  Has periods
   throughout the day of respiratory distress, likely secondary to
   pulmonary edema from underlying diastolic dysfunction. Now 96% on RA.
   Remains wheezy with crackles, but improves with diuresis.
   - More aggressive diuresis with Lasix, closely monitoring lytes.
   - goal 2L diuresis or until respiratory improvement.
   - Closely monitor blood pressure, may warrant going up on BP meds
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Initially, concern for hemolysis given
   hapto <5, but Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.5  today, so appears at baseline.  [**Month (only) 60**] improve with
   diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value [**2130-2-20**] was
   modestly elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Restarted steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend, improving.
   .
   # Weakness/?Neuromuscular issue: Patient at baseline able to walk at
   home, climb stairs holding railing, get up from seated position, per
   wife.  [**Name (NI) 59**] acute change in his baseline functioning prior to admission.
   Would benefit from PT and getting OOB.  If persisitent weakness is

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement, chronic heart failure, pacemaker dependency, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes delirium, supratherapeutic INR, resolved septic shock, hypoxic respiratory distress, anemia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, prostate cancer, thrombocytopenia, weakness/neuromuscular issue, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is characterized by an acute change in mental status. This can be caused by various factors such as medication side effects, metabolic imbalances, infections, or organ dysfunction. It is important to provide frequent reorientation and consider Zyprexa PRN for agitation.

2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated above the target range of 2.5-3.5. This puts him at risk for bleeding complications. Coumadin, which the patient is taking for his pacemaker-dependent status post AVR, should be held, and close monitoring of the INR and potential bleeding symptoms should be conducted.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to experience episodes of respiratory distress, likely secondary to pulmonary edema from underlying diastolic dysfunction."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement, chronic heart failure, pacemaker dependency, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented to the hospital with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include delirium, supratherapeutic INR, resolved septic shock, hypoxic respiratory distress, anemia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, prostate cancer, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as steroid use, metabolic imbalances, or ICU stay. Close monitoring and frequent reorientation are necessary to manage this condition.

2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated above the target range, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. This is concerning given the patient's pacemaker dependency and history of aortic valve replacement. Holding Coumadin, monitoring for visual changes and other sources of bleeding, and conducting daily HCT are recommended.

3. Septic Shock: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, it is essential to continue close monitoring for any signs of recurrence. The source of infection appears to be urinary, considering the positive GBS & E. coli urine cultures. Antibiotic therapy should be continued appropriately.

   IMAGING: CXR [**2130-2-20**]
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there are now
   classically
   signs of moderate pulmonary edema. No evidence of focal parenchymal
   opacities
   suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the
   cardiac
   silhouette. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
   position.
   The referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11451**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by telephone at the
   time of
   dictation.
   ECHO: [**2130-2-20**]:
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen. There is an aortic prosthesis - which appears most likely a
   bioprosthesis. The gradient is higher than expected for this kind of
   prosthesis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restarted home steroids yesterday (hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q
   PM)
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pulled A-line.
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - F/U ECHO to evaluate EF/? New wall motion abnormality
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures. Afebrile, downtrending WBC, not requiring
   pressors. Unconcerning abdominal imaging at OSH. Patient w/ h/o
   urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years ago.
   - D/C IV Cefepime, Flagyl & started Cepodoxime, day [**3-1**]
   - Restarted Hydrocortisone
   - Respiratory viral culture negative
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Resolved. 96% on RA. Remains wheezy
   with crackles, but improved with diuresis
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Concern for hemolysis given hapto <5,
   but Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.5  today, so appears at baseline.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value [**2130-2-20**] was
   modestly elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Restarted steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend, improving.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement, cardiac pacemaker dependence, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is resolving from septic shock. He has multiple medical complications including delirium, supratherapeutic INR, anemia, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, thrombocytopenia, and prostate cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as steroid-induced delirium, toxic metabolic state in the ICU, or withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated above the desired range, increasing the risk of bleeding. This is likely due to Coumadin therapy for his St. Jude valve. The patient needs to have his Coumadin held, and close monitoring of visual changes and other sources of bleeding should be done.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia with a hematocrit of 36.1%. Concern for hemolysis is present due to low haptoglobin levels, but the hematocrit has not downtrended. Trending HCT, guaiac all stools, and maintaining active T/S are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR) on coumadin, chronic heart failure (CHF), pacemaker dependent, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented from home with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. Currently, the patient is recovering and has shown improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is still elevated at 5.9, which is above the desired range of 2.5-3.5. This could increase the risk of bleeding, especially since the patient is on coumadin and has a history of AVR with St. Jude valve. Close monitoring for visual changes and other sources of bleeding is recommended. Daily HCT (hematocrit) monitoring should be continued, and Coumadin dosing should be closely monitored if ketoconazole is restarted.

2. Hypertension: Despite diuresis, the patient's systolic blood pressure remains elevated. He is currently on home antihypertensives and will require good blood pressure control due to diastolic heart failure and a tendency for pulmonary edema. Continuing Lisinopril 40mg PO daily and Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID is recommended. Consider increasing Metoprolol to 25"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, and an artificial ventricular valve who presented with acute onset chills, vomiting, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has shown improvement in their condition.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure but has improved with diuresis. However, they still have mild wheezing and crackles when lying flat, indicating ongoing respiratory issues.

2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5) due to Coumadin therapy for an artificial ventricular valve. This requires close monitoring for bleeding risks and adjustment of Coumadin dosing.

3. Hypertension: The patient has elevated blood pressure despite diuretic therapy and restarting home steroids. Good blood pressure control is essential due to diastolic heart failure and a tendency for pulmonary edema.

4. Diarrhea: The patient has infrequent watery diarrhea, which could be secondary to medication or diet. A C. jejuni infection has been ruled out, and further evaluation is needed.

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with diuresis yesterday, now
   length of stay negative. Now 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   overnight. Remains wheezy with crackles.
   - More aggressive diuresis with Lasix, closely monitoring lytes.
   - goal 2L diuresis or until respiratory improvement.
   - Closely monitor blood pressure, may warrant going up on BP meds
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**4-1**]
   - Restarted Hydrocortisone [**2130-2-20**].
   - Respiratory viral culture negative.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock, much improved
   today.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restarted home steroids yesterday (hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q
   PM)
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pulled A-line, D/C foley once good diuresis acheieved and no longer
   in need of close UOP monitoring.
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Initially, concern for hemolysis given
   hapto <5, but Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.5  today, so appears at baseline.  [**Month (only) 60**] improve with
   diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value [**2130-2-20**] was
   modestly elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Restarted steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend, improving.
   .
   # Weakness/?Neuromuscular issue: Patient at baseline able to walk at
   home, climb stairs holding railing, get up from seated position, per
   wife.  [**Name (NI) 59**] acute change in his baseline functioning prior to admission.
   Would benefit from PT and getting OOB.  If persisitent weakness is

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR) on Coumadin, chronic heart failure (CHF) paced dependent, atrial fibrillation (Afib), prostate cancer (CA) on hydrocortisone. He presented with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has multiple medical complications.

Summary:
- Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient is improving but still wheezy with crackles. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix is ongoing.
- Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR remains elevated at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5) despite holding Coumadin. Monitoring for visual changes and other sources of bleeding is essential.
- Septic shock: Resolved, possibly due to a urinary source given positive gram-negative bacteria (GBS) and E. coli urine cultures.
- Delirium: Improved today, possibly steroid-induced or metabolic in the setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock.
- Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Initial concern for hemolysis given hapto <5, but Hct has not downtrended.
- Acute renal failure: Baseline 1.3, improved to 1.5 today. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): Nearly resolved.
- Prostate CA: PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]. Restarted steroids.
- Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs negative.
- Weakness/neuromuscular issue: Persistent weakness observed prior to admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged hypoxia due to respiratory distress.
2. Bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR.
3. Infection recurrence due to septic shock resolution.
4. Delirium worsening due to continued steroid use.
5. Anemia worsening due to ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.
6. Acute renal failure exacerbation due to nephrotoxic agents or continued ATN.
7. Elevated LFTs worsening due to ongoing liver damage.
8. Prostate cancer progression despite restarted steroids.
9. Thrombocytopenia worsening due to ongoing platelet consumption or bone marrow suppression.
10. Neuromuscular deterioration due to persistent weakness.

Note: The patient's medical history, current conditions, and potential complications should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration."

- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on coumadin. He presented with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. 
- He is currently recovering from hypoxic respiratory distress, with improved oxygenation and breathing unlabored when sitting up, but remaining mildly wheezy with crackles when lying flat.
- His INR is still supratherapeutic at 5.9, despite holding coumadin, and he will require close monitoring for visual changes and other sources of bleeding.
- He has elevated blood pressure despite diuresis and will require good blood pressure control due to diastolic heart failure and tendency for pulmonary edema.
- He is experiencing infrequent watery diarrhea, but C. diff screen is negative.
- He had septic shock which has resolved, possibly from a urinary source given positive GBS and E. coli urine cultures.
- He is improving from delirium, which was likely multifactorial in context of septic shock, ICU stay, and steroids.
- His anemia is stable, but he had acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 and currently at 1.7.
- His thrombocytopenia has resolved, and his prostate cancer is being managed with continued home steroids and consideration for restarting ketoconazole if QT stable"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia. The patient has a history of weakness with ambulation since a hip fracture 6 years ago, but his wife has not noticed any acute worsening of muscle strength or weakness. The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, septic shock, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other ICU medications. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure ranging from 130/67 to 161/92 mmHg, heart rate between 61 and 73 bpm, respiratory rate between 15 and 22 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has been receiving fluids and blood products. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac markers are within normal limits. The patient's microbiology tests for Clostridium difficile and Campylobacter jejuni were negative and pending, respectively. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if there is no improvement in oxygenation or if there is a development of ARDS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has shown some improvement, but still requires respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a slightly elevated blood pressure. The patient's wife reports that he has had weakness with ambulation since a hip fracture 6 years ago, but has not noticed any acute worsening of muscle strength or weakness. The patient is on antibiotics for pneumonia and diuretics for fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's chief complaint is pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory complications such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with some readings in the 140s systolic and others higher. This may indicate potential hypotension or cardiovascular issues.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily increasing, indicating possible renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium levels have been elevated, while sodium levels have been within normal range. This may indicate potential electrolyte imbalances that need to be monitored and managed.
5. Infection control: The patient has had tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and Campylobacter jejuni, with C. diff being negative and Campylobacter jejuni pending. This indicates the need to monitor for any signs of"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with >2.5L diuresis yesterday,
   now length of stay negative. Currently 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   by NC overnight for comfort.  Patient
s breathing unlabored sitting up,
   but remains mildly wheezy with crackles when lying flat.
   - Lasix 40mg PO daily with 40mg IV Lasix PRN, with close eye to renal
   function
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Hypertension: Patient with elevated sbp
s yesterday despite diuresis
   on home antihypertensives, in the setting of restarting home steroids.
   Will require good bp control given diastolic heart failure and tendency
   for pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Lisinopril 40mg PO daily
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Consider increasing Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID (given patient is
   paced)
   # Diarrhea: Patient with infrequent watery diarrhea over past 2 days.
   C. diff screen negative, C. jejuni pending. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   medication/diet. Remains afebrile with normal WBC.
   - F/U C. jejuni
   - If culture negative, can give Loperamide PRN for comfort
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**5-1**]
   - Continue Hydrocortisone
   # Delirium: Improved despite restarting home steroids on [**2-19**]. Prior
   delirium likely multifactorial in context of septic shock, ICU stay,
   and steroids.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Continue home Hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q PM
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Consider D/C
ing Foley today
   # Anemia: Stable over past 24 hours. Hct 39.0 today. Low haptoglobin on
   admission suggested infection driven hemolysis, but appears to have
   resolved with treatment of infection.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission, today rose to 1.7 after
   aggressive diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Minimize additional diuresis if possible
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but will restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Continue home steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. PLT count 158 this AM. At baseline of
   160-200s. DIC labs negative.
   - Continue to trend
   # Weakness/?Neuromuscular issue: Patient at baseline able to walk at
   home, climb stairs holding railing, get up from seated position, per
   wife.  [**Name (NI) 59**] acute change in his baseline functioning prior to admission.
   Would benefit from PT and getting OOB.  If not at baseline per family,
   can consider neurology consult.
