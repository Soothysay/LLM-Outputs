   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 64 year-old female with a history of newly
   diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial CA), afib, DM II, and obesity
   who presents with b/l hydronephrosis, ARF, and b/l DVTs now s/p ex-lap
   currently intubated and on pressors.
   .
   Plan:
   # Post-op hypotension - In setting of likely large amt of 3rd spacing
   from intra-op volume losses. Briefly required both neo and levophed in
   OR and currently just on levophed. Is 6L positive over course of day
   but still appears dry on hemodynamic monitoring with CVP 3 on arrival
   in addition to 5 PEEP. HR and BPs responded nicely to 500 cc LR bolus X
   2. Thus, pt is likely just hypovolemic but cannot rule out distributive
   shock given hypothermia and leukocytosis. Also cannot entirely rule out
   cardiogenic shock, but this is much less likely. Also on differential
   includes massive PE, but less likely as pt has IVC filter.
   - Continue LR bolus for additional liter. Will likely need further IVF
   boluses.
   - Continue IVF boluses and levophed to maintain MAP > 65, UOP > 30
   cc/hr.
   - Monitor Hct q4h prior gyn recs. Will transfuse for Hct < 30. Give
   additional 1 unit pRBC now.
   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - As is dropping BPs on propofol and no plan for extubating tonight,
   will switch sedation to fentanyl and versed prn.
   - Given worsening hemodynamics, leukocytosis, and hypothermia, will
   empirically cover with IV abxs overnight with IV vancomycin, levaquin,
   and flagyl. Continue planned course of 5 days of fluconazole.
   - Check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim, hold off of empiric stress dose steroids for now.
   - Cycle CEs.
   - Check EKG.
   - Consider TTE in am.
   - Check digoxin level. Hold digoxin for now.
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ).
   - w/u for possible infection as below.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 31.8 from 16 pre-operatively. Likely [**2-16**]
   leukomoid stress reaction; however infection/sepsis remains a
   possibility, especially given hypotension (although feel that there are
   other potential causes of low BPs currently) and hypothermia on
   arrival.
   - Check UA, urine cx, blood cxs, CXR.
   - Check c diff toxin given report of diarrhea on gyn floor.
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   - Continue fluconazole for 5 day course (day [**4-20**]) for yeast UTI.
   - Broad spectrum abxs given
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Intubated in setting of going to OR. Will plan
   on keeping on ventilator for now given hypotension requiring pressors,
   IVFs, pRBC products.
   - Fentanyl/versed for sedation.
   - Daily wakening, RSBI.
   - Check CXR.
   - Serial ABGs.
   - No h/o lung dz, may need diuresis once hypotension resolves if
   weaning from vent becomes difficult.
   .
   # Uterine mass - Recently diagnosed and likely endometrial CA per OSH
   pathology reports. Path here pending.
   - Appreciate gyn-onc following.
   - f/u path.
   .
   # Bilateral hydronephrosis/ARF - [**2-16**] massive tumor compression.
   Associated ARF appears to be resolving with IVFs. Now s/p tumor
   debulking. Cr trend Cr 3.0 -> 2.4 -> 2.1 -> 1.7 ->1.6.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, urine output closely.
   - Bolusing IVFs as above.
   - Monitor UOP as above.
   .
   #) Bilateral DVT - Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Unclear if
   actually was on coumadin as [**Last Name (LF) 265**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to verify with family
   tomorrow. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q scan at OSH negative for
   PE.
   - Holding anti-coagulation post-operatively for 48-72 hrs per gyn.
   .
   #) Afib - Tachycardic up to 160s intermittently in setting of increased
   pain/agitation, responds to versed boluses. HR also seems to be
   responsive to IVF boluses as above. Other considerations for
   tachycardia include infection or PE.
   - Hold anticoagulation 48-72 hours per gyn-onc.
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - Switch digoxin to IV dosing given NPO status. Holding b-blockade
   given hypotension.
   - Check EKG.
   - Cycling CEs.
   - Consider switching over to neo gtt from levophed gtt if tachycardia
   remains persistent issue.
   - Can also consider initiation of esmolol gtt if remains persistently
   tachycardic in spite of IVF resuscitation.
   .
   #) HTN - Holding anti-HTNs given hypotension currently.
   .
   #) Decubitus Ulcer - From OSH. Stage 2 sacral decub ulcer.
   - Appreciate wound care following. Dressing changes per wound care.
   - b/l waffle boots.
   .
   #) DM type II - Holding sulfonylurea. Switching RISS to HISS.
   .
   # FEN:  NPO given recent bowel manipulation. IVFs as above. Favor
   boluses over maintenance infusions currently. Will need to consider
   further nutrition if difficult to wean from vent.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of newly diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial cancer), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and obesity. She presents with bilateral hydronephrosis, acute renal failure, and bilateral deep vein thromboses. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and is currently intubated and on pressors. She also has a decubitus ulcer, diabetes type II, and a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension - The patient experienced post-operative hypotension, which was initially treated with both norepinephrine and phenylephrine. The patient responded well to a 500 cc normal saline bolus, suggesting hypovolemia. However, distributive shock, cardiogenic shock, massive pulmonary embolism, and hypothermia should be considered as well.

2. Respiratory Failure - The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She may require daily awakening and weaning trials with respiratory system compliance monitoring. A chest X-ray, serial arterial blood gases (ABGs), and diuresis may be necessary if weaning from the ventilator becomes difficult.

3. Uterine Mass - The patient has a recently diagnosed uterine mass likely due to endometrial cancer. Further evaluation by gynecologic oncology is recommended, and pathology reports are pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 64 year-old female with a history of newly
   diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial CA), afib, DM II, and obesity
   who presents with b/l hydronephrosis, ARF, and b/l DVTs now s/p ex-lap
   currently intubated and on pressors.
   .
   Plan:
   # Post-op hypotension - In setting of likely large amt of 3rd spacing
   from intra-op volume losses. Briefly required both neo and levophed in
   OR and currently just on levophed. Is 6L positive over course of day
   but still appears dry on hemodynamic monitoring with CVP 3 on arrival
   in addition to 5 PEEP. HR and BPs responded nicely to 500 cc LR bolus X
   2. Thus, pt is likely just hypovolemic but cannot rule out distributive
   shock given hypothermia and leukocytosis. Also cannot entirely rule out
   cardiogenic shock, but this is much less likely. Also on differential
   includes massive PE, but less likely as pt has IVC filter.
   - Continue LR bolus for additional liter. Will likely need further IVF
   boluses.
   - Continue IVF boluses and levophed to maintain MAP > 65, UOP > 30
   cc/hr.
   - Monitor Hct q4h prior gyn recs. Will transfuse for Hct < 30. Give
   additional 1 unit pRBC now.
   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - As is dropping BPs on propofol and no plan for extubating tonight,
   will switch sedation to fentanyl and versed prn.
   - Given worsening hemodynamics, leukocytosis, and hypothermia, will
   empirically cover with IV abxs overnight with IV vancomycin, levaquin,
   and flagyl. Continue planned course of 5 days of fluconazole.
   - Check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim, hold off of empiric stress dose steroids for now.
   - Cycle CEs.
   - Check EKG.
   - Consider TTE in am.
   - Check digoxin level. Hold digoxin for now.
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ).
   - w/u for possible infection as below.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 31.8 from 16 pre-operatively. Likely [**2-16**]
   leukomoid stress reaction; however infection/sepsis remains a
   possibility, especially given hypotension (although feel that there are
   other potential causes of low BPs currently) and hypothermia on
   arrival.
   - Check UA, urine cx, blood cxs, CXR.
   - Check c diff toxin given report of diarrhea on gyn floor.
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   - Continue fluconazole for 5 day course (day [**4-20**]) for yeast UTI.
   - Broad spectrum abxs given
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Intubated in setting of going to OR. Will plan
   on keeping on ventilator for now given hypotension requiring pressors,
   IVFs, pRBC products.
   - Fentanyl/versed for sedation.
   - Daily wakening, RSBI.
   - Check CXR.
   - Serial ABGs.
   - No h/o lung dz, may need diuresis once hypotension resolves if
   weaning from vent becomes difficult.
   .
   # Uterine mass - Recently diagnosed and likely endometrial CA per OSH
   pathology reports. Path here pending.
   - Appreciate gyn-onc following.
   - f/u path.
   .
   # Bilateral hydronephrosis/ARF - [**2-16**] massive tumor compression.
   Associated ARF appears to be resolving with IVFs. Now s/p tumor
   debulking. Cr trend Cr 3.0 -> 2.4 -> 2.1 -> 1.7 ->1.6.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, urine output closely.
   - Bolusing IVFs as above.
   - Monitor UOP as above.
   .
   #) Bilateral DVT - Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Unclear if
   actually was on coumadin as [**Last Name (LF) 265**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to verify with family
   tomorrow. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q scan at OSH negative for
   PE.
   - Holding anti-coagulation post-operatively for 48-72 hrs per gyn.
   .
   #) Afib - Tachycardic up to 160s intermittently in setting of increased
   pain/agitation, responds to versed boluses. HR also seems to be
   responsive to IVF boluses as above. Other considerations for
   tachycardia include infection or PE.
   - Hold anticoagulation 48-72 hours per gyn-onc.
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - Switch digoxin to IV dosing given NPO status. Holding b-blockade
   given hypotension.
   - Check EKG.
   - Cycling CEs.
   - Consider switching over to neo gtt from levophed gtt if tachycardia
   remains persistent issue.
   - Can also consider initiation of esmolol gtt if remains persistently
   tachycardic in spite of IVF resuscitation.
   .
   #) HTN - Holding anti-HTNs given hypotension currently.
   .
   #) Decubitus Ulcer - From OSH. Stage 2 sacral decub ulcer.
   - Appreciate wound care following. Dressing changes per wound care.
   - b/l waffle boots.
   .
   #) DM type II - Holding sulfonylurea. Switching RISS to HISS.
   .
   # FEN:  NPO given recent bowel manipulation. IVFs as above. Favor
   boluses over maintenance infusions currently. Will need to consider
   further nutrition if difficult to wean from vent.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass (likely endometrial cancer), atrial fibrillation, diabetes type II, and obesity. She presents with bilateral hydronephrosis, acute renal failure, and bilateral deep vein thrombosis post-ex-laparotomy. She is currently intubated and on pressors. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/92 mmHg to 108/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg, total fluid intake of 11,717 mL, total fluid output of 10,317 mL, and urine output of 275 mL. She is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, phenylephrine, esmolol, pantoprazole, heparin, and others.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Post-operative hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to significant intraoperative fluid losses. She has responded well to 500 cc normal saline bolus twice and is currently on levophed. Further IV fluid boluses will be given as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and urine output above 30 cc"

 Likely  large amt of 3rd spacing from intra-op
   volume losses, however sepsis is still possible.  Less likely cardiac
   etiology. [**Last Name (un) **] Stim increased <7 but started 32 so difficult to
   interpret.  Hypotension also worsened by afib w/RVR likely due to
   decreased cardiac output,  MAPs have improved on esmolol gtt.
   -given risk of infection and lack of evidence for adrenal
   insufficiency, will D/C steroids
   -Continue broad spectrum ABX for at least 24 more hours pending culture
   results ( vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl. Also planned course of 5
   days of fluconazole for yeast in urine). f/u all cultures.
   -continue esmolol gtt for HR<110

   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - Given worsening hemodynamics, leukocytosis, and hypothermia, will
   empirically cover with IV abxs overnight with IV
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ).

   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 41 this morning from post-op of 31.8 from 16
   pre-op. Likely [**2-16**] stress reaction plus effect of steroids, however as
   above, infection has not been ruled out.
   - f/u  urine cx, blood cxs
   - Check c diff toxin
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   - As above, Continue fluconazole for 5 day course (day [**4-20**]) for yeast
   UTI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and obesity. She presents with bilateral hydronephrosis, acute renal failure, and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). She underwent exploratory laparotomy and is currently intubated and on pressors. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, leukocytosis, hypothermia, respiratory issues, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, decubitus ulcer, diabetes type II, and poor nutritional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of broad-spectrum antibiotics, leukocytosis, and potential for hospital-acquired infections.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient has acute renal failure and impaired liver function, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count raises concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further complications.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and possible decreased cardiac output indicate the need for careful monitoring and management of her cardiovascular status.
5. Respiratory problems: Intubation and mechanical ventilation pose risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

   Assessment and Plan
   Post-operative shock, s/p exploratory laparatomy with TAH/BSO.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent post-op.  Significant volume
   resussitation.  Monitor ABG, CXR.  Hope to work towards SBT and
   extubation once resussitated and diuresing.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia, 3rd spacing.  Also concern
   for sepsis.  Adequate baseline cortisol, but not significant change in
   response to cortrosyn stimulation.  With adequate baseline level,
   consider holding steroids.
   A-FIB -- rapid response, now contolled with esmolol.  Monitor HR.
   FLUIDS -- significant 3rd spacing, receiving significant volume
   resusitation.  MOnitor I/O, CVP, urine output.
   RENAL FAILURE -- in setting of hydronephrosis, concern for obstruction
   (ureteral compression).  Improved.  Monitor BUN, creat, UO.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- suspect related to bleeding, but possible related
   to heparin use --> d/c heparin, check HIT antibodies.
   DVT -- IVC filter in place.  To resume heparin as per GYN surgery once
   deemed safe.
   NIDDM -- monitor glucose.  Maintain glucose <150.
   ENDOMETRIAL CA -- s/p debulking.  No immediate plans for chemotherapy.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF once bowel ileus resolves.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill post-operative patient who underwent exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with ongoing support from vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation and blood products.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: heart rate (HR) of 90 bpm with atrial fibrillation (A-fib) controlled with esmolol, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 132/72 to 93 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) set at 10 breaths per minute with spontaneous RR of 0, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%, central venous pressure (CVP) at 9 mmHg, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 41.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels at 217 mg/dL, hyponatremia with sodium levels at 107 mEq/L, and thrombocytopenia with platelet count (Plt) at 134 K/uL. Other lab results indicate renal failure with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes.

   Assessment and Plan
   Post-operative shock, s/p exploratory laparatomy with TAH/BSO.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent post-op.  Significant volume
   resussitation.  Monitor ABG, CXR.  Hope to work towards SBT and
   extubation once resussitated and diuresing.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia, 3rd spacing.  Also concern
   for sepsis.  Adequate baseline cortisol, but not significant change in
   response to cortrosyn stimulation.  With adequate baseline level,
   consider holding steroids.
   A-FIB -- rapid response, now contolled with esmolol.  Monitor HR.
   FLUIDS -- significant 3rd spacing, receiving significant volume
   resusitation.  MOnitor I/O, CVP, urine output.
   RENAL FAILURE -- in setting of hydronephrosis, concern for obstruction
   (ureteral compression).  Improved.  Monitor BUN, creat, UO.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- suspect related to bleeding, but possible related
   to heparin use --> d/c heparin, check HIT antibodies.
   DVT -- IVC filter in place.  To resume heparin as per GYN surgery once
   deemed safe.
   NIDDM -- monitor glucose.  Maintain glucose <150.
   ENDOMETRIAL CA -- s/p debulking.  No immediate plans for chemotherapy.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF once bowel ileus resolves.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill female who underwent exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She is experiencing post-operative shock, respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure. The patient has a history of endometrial cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thrombocytopenia. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and various medications for pain and infection prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further lung complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could progress to septic shock if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: If left untreated or uncontrolled, the patient's atrial fibrillation could result in the formation of blood clots, which can travel to other organs and cause complications like stroke or pulmonary embolism.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure could worsen if fluid balance and kidney function are not closely monitored, leading to electrolyte imbalances and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
5. Thrombocytopenia: If the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia is not identified and addressed, it may continue to pose a"

   and obesity who presents with b/l hydronephrosis, ARF, and b/l DVTs now
   s/p ex-lap currently intubated and on pressors.
   .
   Plan:
   # Post-op hypotension
 Likely  large amt of 3rd spacing from intra-op
   volume losses, however sepsis is still possible.  Less likely cardiac
   etiology. [**Last Name (un) **] Stim increased <7 but started 32 so difficult to
   interpret- steroids given o/n [**1-7**] only.  Hypotension also worsened by
   afib w/RVR likely due to decreased cardiac output. Esmolol gtt d/c
   yesterday [**2-16**] hypotension.
   -Continue broad spectrum ABX for at least 24 more hours pending culture
   results ( vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl. Also finished 5 day course
   of fluconazole for yeast in urine). f/u all cultures.
   - Continue IVF boluses and levophed to maintain MAP > 65, UOP > 30
   cc/hr.
   - Monitor Hct daily
   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ)
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC decr today to 26.7 from peak 41.6 yest. Likely [**2-16**]
   stress reaction plus effect of steroids, however as above, infection
   has not been ruled out.
   - f/u  urine cx, blood cxs
   - Check c diff toxin once pt stools
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   - As above, Broad spectrum  abx
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of volume resuscitation and hypotension. Today, pt on trial of CPAP and
   doing well.
    - Fentanyl/versed for sedation (currently at 35/3.5).
   - Daily wakening, RSBI (67 today).
   - Daily CXR.
   - may need diuresis once hypotension resolves if weaning from vent
   becomes difficult.

   # Uterine mass - Recently diagnosed and likely endometrial vs ovarian
   CA. Path here pending.
   - Appreciate gyn-onc following.
   - f/u path.

   # Bilateral hydronephrosis/ARF - [**2-16**] massive tumor compression now
   resolving with IVFs and s/p tumor debulking. Cr to 1.2 today from high
   of 2.1 on admission.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, urine output closely.
   - Bolusing IVFs as above.
   - Monitor UOP as above.
   .
   #) Bilateral DVT - Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Seems to have
   been on coumadin as outpt. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q scan at
   OSH negative for PE.
   - Holding anti-coagulation post-operatively for 48-72 hrs per gyn
   .
   #) Afib - Tachycardic up to 160s intermittently in setting of increased
   pain/agitation [**1-7**], responded to versed boluses. HR also seems to be
   responsive to IVF boluses as above. Other considerations for
   tachycardia include infection or PE.
   - Hold anticoagulation 48-72 hours per gyn-onc.
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - continue digoxin

   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 .H/O ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Assessment: This is a 64 year-old female with a history of newly
   diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial CA), afib, DM II, and obesity
   who presents with b/l hydronephrosis, ARF, and b/l DVTs now s/p ex-lap
   currently intubated and on pressors.
   .
   Plan:
   # Post-op hypotension
 Likely  large amt of 3rd spacing from intra-op
   volume losses, however sepsis is still possible.  Less likely cardiac
   etiology. [**Last Name (un) **] Stim increased <7 but started 32 so difficult to
   interpret.  Hypotension also worsened by afib w/RVR likely due to
   decreased cardiac output,  MAPs have improved on esmolol gtt.
   -given risk of infection and lack of evidence for adrenal
   insufficiency, will D/C steroids
   -Continue broad spectrum ABX for at least 24 more hours pending culture
   results ( vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl. Also planned course of 5
   days of fluconazole for yeast in urine). f/u all cultures.
   -continue esmolol gtt for HR<110
   - Continue IVF boluses and levophed to maintain MAP > 65, UOP > 30
   cc/hr.
   - Monitor Hct q6h as well as DIC labs q6h
   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - Given worsening hemodynamics, leukocytosis, and hypothermia, will
   empirically cover with IV abxs overnight with IV
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ)
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 41 this morning from post-op of 31.8 from 16
   pre-op. Likely [**2-16**] stress reaction plus effect of steroids, however as
   above, infection has not been ruled out.
   - f/u  urine cx, blood cxs
   - Check c diff toxin
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   - As above, Continue fluconazole for 5 day course (day [**4-20**]) for yeast
   UTI.
   - As above, Broad spectrum
   .
   # Respiratory
 Intubated for airway protection in the setting of
   volume resuscitation and hypotension. Will plan to wean the vent once
   the patient
s issues of hypotension have resolved and she is mobilizing
   her excess volume..
   - Fentanyl/versed for sedation.
   - Daily wakening, RSBI.
   - Daily CXR.
   - Serial ABGs.
   - may need diuresis once hypotension resolves if weaning from vent
   becomes difficult.
   .
   # Uterine mass - Recently diagnosed and likely endometrial CA per OSH
   pathology reports. Path here pending.
   - Appreciate gyn-onc following.
   - f/u path.
   .
   # Bilateral hydronephrosis/ARF - [**2-16**] massive tumor compression now
   resolving with IVFs and s/p tumor debulking. Cr trend Cr 3.0 -> 2.4 ->
   2.1 -> 1.7 ->1.6-> 1.1 today.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, urine output closely.
   - Bolusing IVFs as above.
   - Monitor UOP as above.
   .
   #) Bilateral DVT - Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Unclear if
   actually was on coumadin as outpt,. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q
   scan at OSH negative for PE.
   - will need to verify with family tomorrow if patient was on coumadin
   - Holding anti-coagulation post-operatively for 48-72 hrs per gyn
   .
   #) Afib - Tachycardic up to 160s intermittently in setting of increased
   pain/agitation, responds to versed boluses. HR also seems to be
   responsive to IVF boluses as above. Other considerations for
   tachycardia include infection or PE.
   - Hold anticoagulation 48-72 hours per gyn-onc.
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - continue esmolol for rate control
   - continue digoxin
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Concern for HIT given decreased >50% and heparin
   products.
   -D/C sub Q heparin
   -send HIT antibody
   #) HTN - Holding anti-HTNs given hypotension currently.
   .
   #) Decubitus Ulcer - From OSH. Stage 2 sacral decub ulcer. Also ulcer
   on toe
   -f/u culture from purent toe wound.
   - Appreciate wound care following. Dressing changes per wound care.
   - b/l waffle boots.
   .

 Hyperglycemic overnight on HISS.
   -Start NPH 8qam, 8qpm

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and obesity.
- She presents with bilateral hydronephrosis, acute renal failure, and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and is currently intubated and on pressors.
- The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap) for tumor resection and was found to have a likely endometrial cancer.
- Postoperative, she experienced hypotension, which has been attributed to volume losses and possibly sepsis. The patient's blood pressure has improved with fluid boluses and phenylephrine.
- The patient's leukocyte count has increased from 16 preoperatively to 41, indicating leukocytosis. Infection has not been ruled out, and cultures are pending.
- The patient is also experiencing respiratory issues due to airway edema, and will be weaned off the ventilator once her hypotension resolves and she is mobilizing excess volume.
- The patient has a history of bilateral DVT and received an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. It is unclear if she was on coumadin as an outpatient.
- The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which responds to versed boluses and esmolol.
- Thrombocytopenia is a concern, possibly related to heparin-induced"

   yesterday [**2-16**] hypotension.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Respiratory Failure
 Intubated for airway
   protection in the setting of volume resuscitation and hypotension.
   Currently tolerating SBT.  Hope for extubation once achieve net

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.
- They are tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and deny dyspnea.
- The patient is off esmolol and vasopressor.
- Sedation has been discontinued, and the patient remains comfortable.
- The patient has allergies to sulfur and elemental substances.
- The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications.
- The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are mostly unchanged from admission except for some specific noted changes.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 35%, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 70.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/65 mmHg to 152/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response.
- The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, fluid balance of 1,742 mL total input and 1,031 mL total output, urine output of 1,031 mL, and NG tube output of 40 mL.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate level, and other abnormalities.
- The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, uterine mass, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, decubitus ulcer, and potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. Potential complications could include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels, indicating possible infection. Sepsis could be a potential complication if not appropriately managed.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has a history of acute renal failure and currently has an elevated creatinine level. Further deterioration of renal function is a potential complication.
4. Bleeding Complications: Due to thrombocytopenia and the possibility of HIT, the patient is at risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation and hypotension, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction or stroke.
6. Wound Complications: The patient has a stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, which may worsen if not properly managed, leading to deeper tissue damage or infection.

It is crucial to closely monitor and manage these potential medical complications to optimize the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOTENSION, Post-op
 Likely  large amt of 3rd spacing from intra-op
   volume losses, however sepsis is still possible.  Less likely cardiac
   etiology. [**Last Name (un) **] Stim increased <7 but started 32 so difficult to
   interpret- steroids given o/n [**1-7**] only.  Hypotension also worsened by
   afib w/RVR likely due to decreased cardiac output. Esmolol gtt d/c
   yesterday [**2-16**] hypotension.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Respiratory Failure
 Intubated for airway
   protection in the setting of volume resuscitation and hypotension.
   Today, pt on trial of CPAP and doing well.
   FLUID -- desire net diuresis if possible.
   UTERINE MASS -- Recently diagnosed and likely endometrial vs ovarian
   CA. Path here pending.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Bilateral hydronephrosis/ARF - [**2-16**] massive tumor
   compression now resolving with IVFs and s/p tumor debulking. Cr to 1.2
   today from high of 2.1 on admission.
   DVT, Bilateral -- Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Seems to have
   been on coumadin as outpt. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q scan at
   OSH negative for PE.
   A-FIB  -- Tachycardic to 160s intermittently in setting of increased
   pain/agitation [**1-7**], responded to versed boluses. HR also seems to be
   responsive to IVF boluses as above. Other considerations for
   tachycardia include infection or PE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- Concern for HIT given decreased >50% and heparin
   products.  Would hold on heparin products until HIT antibody results
   available.
   DECUBITUS ULCER -- From home. Stage 2 sacral decub ulcer. Also ulcer on
   toe

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial this morning without experiencing dyspnea. They are no longer on esmolol or vasopressor support. Sedation was discontinued last night, and the patient remains comfortable.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which required intubation for airway protection during volume resuscitation and hypotension. Today, the patient is being tried on CPAP and is doing well. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, with a desire for net diuresis if possible.

Other notable conditions include acute renal failure, likely secondary to bilateral hydronephrosis and tumor compression, which is now resolving with IVFs and post tumor debulking. The patient also has a recently diagnosed uterine mass, possibly endometrial or ovarian cancer, with pathology pending.

The patient presented with bilateral lower extremity swelling and was found to have bilateral deep vein thrombosis. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and a V/Q scan at OSH was negative for pulmonary embolism.

The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation with heart rates in the 160s intermittently, particularly during increased pain and agitation. This has responded to versed boluses. The patient's tachycardia may also be due to IVF boluses.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of MMP, presenting with an abdominal pelvic mass likely due to endometriosis, resulting in renal failure and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been sedated due to altered mental status. She has been started on morphine PRN, and her pain has been controlled. The patient's respiratory status is stable with a RSBI of 50s, but she is not extubated due to ongoing positive endotracheal tube leak test (LOS 18L positive). Diuretics have been attempted, but there has been no significant response. The patient has also received antibiotics for suspected infection, which was ruled out. Heparin has been initiated due to a negative HIT antibody test. 

Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has been compromised, as indicated by the presence of renal failure. This may require ongoing management and support.
2. Bilateral Lower Extremity Edema: The patient is experiencing swelling in both lower extremities, which could be a result of fluid retention or other underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to sedation and possibly other contributing factors. Close monitoring and management of the patient's neurological status are essential.
4. Airway Inability: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to an"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 64 year-old female with a history of newly
   diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial vs ovarian CA), afib, DM II,
   and obesity who presents with b/l hydronephrosis, ARF, and b/l DVTs now
   s/p ex-lap currently intubated and on pressors.
   .
   Plan:
   # Post-op hypotension
 Resolved x 24 hours, has not required boluses.
   Likely  large amt of 3rd spacing from intra-op volume losses, sepsis
   less likely as patient has remained afebrile, cultures are negative to
   date.  HCT stable, no signs of bleeding.
   -D/C  vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl.
   - Monitor Hct daily
   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ)
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC decr today to 14.1 today, likely related to d/c of
   steroids, also because post-surgical stress reaction .   As above,
   unlikely to be infection
   - f/u  urine cx, blood cxs
   - Check c diff toxin once pt stools
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of volume resuscitation and hypotension. Patient doing well on CPAP,
   but 18L positive for LOS so concern that the patient will have flash
   pulmonary edema without the positive pressure of the vent.  Will try to
   diurese aggressively and plan to extubate when at least 9L diuresed
   off.
    -D/C fentanyl/versed and start morphine PRN
   - Daily wakening, RSBI (50 today).
   - Daily CXR.
   - As patient
s creatinine is normalized, can start Lasix PRN with goal
   -2 to -3L negative.
   .
   #Constipation:
   -continue tube feeds
   -start reglan
   # Uterine mass - Recently diagnosed and likely endometrial vs ovarian
   CA. Path here pending.
   - Appreciate gyn-onc following.
   - f/u path.
   # Bilateral hydronephrosis/Acute renal failure - [**2-16**] massive tumor
   compression now resolving with IVFs and s/p tumor debulking. Cr to 1.0
   today from high of 2.1 on admission.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, urine output closely.
   #) Bilateral DVT - Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Seems to have
   been on coumadin as outpt. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q scan at
   OSH negative for PE.  Patient with acute drop in platelets, so d/c
   heparin SQ and sent HIT
   -hold Heparin products until HIT ab returns.
   .
   #) Afib w/ RVR: Patient without RVR for 24 hours, off esmolol gtt.
   However, now on no nodal agents.  Had been on diltiazem at home.
   -start diltiazem 30QID ([**1-16**] home dose)
   - restart anticoagulation for stroke prevention when HIT antibody test
   comes back
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - change digoxin  to PO
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Platelets now stable. Was concern for HIT given
   decreased >50% and heparin products. Pt now off all heparin products.
   Also possibly related to post-surgical DIC though labs not consistent
   with DIC.
   -f/u HIT antibody
   #) Decubitus Ulcer - From home. Stage 2 sacral decub ulcer. Also ulcer
   on toe
   -f/u culture from purent toe wound- currently showing Staph Aureus,
   likely skin contaminant.
   - Appreciate wound care following. Dressing changes per wound care.
   - b/l waffle boots.
   #) DM type II
 Sugars well contolled with NPH.
   -NPH 8qam, 8qpm

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of newly diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial vs ovarian cancer), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and obesity. She presents with bilateral hydronephrosis, acute renal failure, and bilateral deep vein thrombosis. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and is currently intubated and on pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Post-operative hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension after surgery but has since resolved. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and hematocrit levels. The plan is to discontinue unnecessary antibiotics and hold antihypertensive medications.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count but has decreased today. This could be related to the discontinuation of steroids or a post-surgical stress response. Further evaluation of urine and blood cultures is needed, as well as monitoring temperature and white blood cell count.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection during volume resuscitation and hypotension. She is doing well on CPAP but still requires 18L positive for oxygen. There is concern about flash pulmonary edema without positive pressure ventilation. Aggressive diuresis is planned, and extubation will be considered when the patient is able to maintain adequate oxygenation without positive pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 64 year-old female with a history of newly
   diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial vs ovarian CA), afib, DM II,
   and obesity who presents with b/l hydronephrosis, ARF, and b/l DVTs now
   s/p ex-lap currently intubated while being diuresed (volume overload
   post-op).
   Plan:
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of volume resuscitation and hypotension. Patient doing well on PS, but
   concern that the patient will have flash pulmonary edema without the
   positive pressure of the vent.  Will try to diurese aggressively and
   plan to extubate when at least 9L diuresed off.
    -D/C fentanyl/versed and start morphine PRN
   - Daily wakening, RSBI (50 today).
   - Daily CXR.
   - As patient
s creatinine is normalized, can start Lasix PRN with goal
   -1 to -2 L negative.
   # Post-op hypotension
 Resolved x 24 hours. Intraoperative volume
   loss. Third spacing currently. Currently on PS with minimal PPV
   (PS/PEEP [**5-20**]). No evidence of sepsis (no infectious source), off
   antibiotics
   - Monitor Hct daily
   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ)
   - Continue diuresis (goal -1 to -2 L) with IV lasix.
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC stable at ~14, likely cortisol stress response
   post-op.   As above, unlikely to be infection
   - f/u  urine cx, blood cxs
   - Check c diff toxin once pt stools
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   # Elevated INR: likely in setting of poor nutritional status. Not on
   coumadin, but on heparin gtt. Unlikely shock liver 2
 to hypotension
   (LFTs normal). Unlikely DIC (platelets stable, fibrinogen levels
   normal).
   - vit K x3 days
   - Nutrition recs
   - consult heme if INR does not reverse w/ vit K.
   #) Afib w/ RVR: Patient without RVR for 24 hours, off esmolol gtt.
   However, now on no nodal agents.  Had been on diltiazem at home.
   -decrease  diltiazem to 15 mg QID
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - change digoxin to PO
   - check dig level today
   #) Bilateral DVT - Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Seems to have
   been on coumadin as outpt. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q scan at
   OSH negative for PE.  HIT antibody negative.
   - continue heparin gtt.
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Platelets now stable. Was concern for HIT given
   decreased >50% and heparin products. HIT negative, heparin gtt
   restarted.
   # Bilateral hydronephrosis/Acute renal failure - [**2-16**] massive tumor
   compression now resolving with IVFs and s/p tumor debulking. Cr to 1.1
   today from high of 2.1 on admission.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, urine output closely.
   .
   #Constipation:  Likely post-surgical.
   -continue tube feeds (increase rate slightly for better nutritional
   status).
   -start reglan
   # Uterine mass - Recently diagnosed and likely endometrial vs ovarian
   CA. Path here pending.
   - Appreciate gyn-onc following.
   - f/u path.
   #) Decubitus Ulcer - From home. Stage 2 sacral decub ulcer. Also ulcer
   on toe
   -f/u culture from purent toe wound- currently showing Staph Aureus,
   likely skin contaminant.
   - Appreciate wound care following. Dressing changes per wound care.
   - b/l waffle boots.
   #) DM type II
 Sugars well contolled with NPH.
   -NPH 8qam, 8qpm
   # Comm: with pt's son, [**Name (NI) 4546**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4547**] (h), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4548**] (c)- gyn

   Disposition: in ICU while intubated
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of MMP presenting with abdominal pelvic mass, renal failure, and bilateral leg edema. She has been intubated and is currently in the ICU. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, post-operative hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated INR, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombocytopenia, bilateral hydronephrosis/acute renal failure, constipation, uterine mass, decubitus ulcer, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for flash pulmonary edema without the positive pressure of the ventilator. Aggressive diuresis is planned, and extubation will be considered when the patient has diuresed off at least 9 liters.
2. Post-Operative Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension post-surgery, which has since resolved. Volume loss and third spacing are suspected causes. The patient is currently on partial support with minimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). No evidence of sepsis is present, and antibiotics have been discontinued.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a stable white blood cell count of approximately 14, likely due to a cortisol stress response post-operation. There is no evidence of infection,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 64 year-old female with a history of newly
   diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial vs ovarian CA), afib, DM II,
   and obesity who presents with b/l hydronephrosis, ARF, and b/l DVTs now
   s/p ex-lap currently intubated while being diuresed (volume overload
   post-op).
   Plan:
   # Post-op hypotension
 Resolved x 24 hours. Intraoperative volume
   loss. Third spacing currently. Currently on PS with minimal PPV
   (PS/PEEP [**5-20**]). No evidence of sepsis (no infectious source), off
   antibiotics
   - Monitor Hct daily
   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ)
   - Continue diuresis (goal -1 to -2 L) with IV lasix.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC stable at ~14, likely cortisol stress response
   post-op.   As above, unlikely to be infection
   - f/u  urine cx, blood cxs
   - Check c diff toxin once pt stools
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of volume resuscitation and hypotension. Patient doing well on PS, but
   concern that the patient will have flash pulmonary edema without the
   positive pressure of the vent.  Will try to diurese aggressively and
   plan to extubate when at least 9L diuresed off.
    -D/C fentanyl/versed and start morphine PRN
   - Daily wakening, RSBI (50 today).
   - Daily CXR.
   - As patient
s creatinine is normalized, can start Lasix PRN with goal
   -1 to -2 L negative.
   # Elevated INR: likely in setting of poor nutritional status. Unlikely
   shock liver 2
 to hypotension (LFTs normal). Unlikely DIC (fibrinogen
   levels normal).
   - vit K x3 days
   - increase tube feeds.
   .
   #Constipation:
   -continue tube feeds (increase rate slightly for better nutritional
   status).
   -start reglan
   # Uterine mass - Recently diagnosed and likely endometrial vs ovarian
   CA. Path here pending.
   - Appreciate gyn-onc following.
   - f/u path.
   # Bilateral hydronephrosis/Acute renal failure - [**2-16**] massive tumor
   compression now resolving with IVFs and s/p tumor debulking. Cr to 1.1
   today from high of 2.1 on admission.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, urine output closely.
   #) Bilateral DVT - Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Seems to have
   been on coumadin as outpt. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q scan at
   OSH negative for PE.  HIT antibody negative.
   - continue heparin gtt.
   .
   #) Afib w/ RVR: Patient without RVR for 24 hours, off esmolol gtt.
   However, now on no nodal agents.  Had been on diltiazem at home.
   -decrease  diltiazem to 15 mg QID
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - change digoxin  to PO
   - check dig level
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Platelets now stable. Was concern for HIT given
   decreased >50% and heparin products. Pt now off all heparin products.
   Also possibly related to post-surgical DIC though labs not consistent
   with DIC.
   -f/u HIT antibody
   #) Decubitus Ulcer - From home. Stage 2 sacral decub ulcer. Also ulcer
   on toe
   -f/u culture from purent toe wound- currently showing Staph Aureus,
   likely skin contaminant.
   - Appreciate wound care following. Dressing changes per wound care.
   - b/l waffle boots.
   #) DM type II
 Sugars well contolled with NPH.

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of newly diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial vs ovarian cancer), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and obesity. She presents with bilateral hydronephrosis, acute renal failure, and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) now status post exploratory laparotomy. The patient is currently intubated while being diuresed (volume overload post-op).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to volume resuscitation and hypotension. There is concern about flash pulmonary edema without positive pressure ventilation. Aggressive diuresis will be attempted, and the plan is to extubate when at least 9 liters are diuresed off.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is now resolving with intravenous fluids and post-operative tumor debulking. Close monitoring of creatinine and urine output is necessary.

3. Bilateral DVT: The patient has a history of bilateral DVT and was on coumadin as an outpatient. She has undergone inferior vena cava filter placement, and V/Q scan at OSH was negative for pulmonary embolism. HIT antibody negative. Continue heparin gtt.

4. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer and"

   s/p ex-lap currently intubated while being diuresed (volume overload
   post-op).
   Plan:
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of volume resuscitation and hypotension. Patient doing well on PS, but
   concern that the patient will have flash pulmonary edema without the
   positive pressure of the vent.  Will try to diurese aggressively and
   plan to extubate when at least 9L diuresed off.
    -D/C fentanyl/versed and start morphine PRN
   - Daily wakening, RSBI (50 today).
   - Daily CXR.
   - As patient
s creatinine is normalized, can start Lasix PRN with goal
   -1 to -2 L negative.
   # Post-op hypotension
 Resolved x 24 hours. Intraoperative volume
   loss. Third spacing currently. Currently on PS with minimal PPV
   (PS/PEEP [**5-20**]). No evidence of sepsis (no infectious source), off
   antibiotics
   - Monitor Hct daily
   - CVP goal [**8-27**].
   - Hold anti-HTNs (ACEI, b-blocker, HCTZ)
   - Continue diuresis (goal -1 to -2 L) with IV lasix.
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC stable at ~14, likely cortisol stress response
   post-op.   As above, unlikely to be infection
   - f/u  urine cx, blood cxs
   - Check c diff toxin once pt stools
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC.
   # Elevated INR: likely in setting of poor nutritional status. Not on
   coumadin, but on heparin gtt. Unlikely shock liver 2
 to hypotension
   (LFTs normal). Unlikely DIC (platelets stable, fibrinogen levels
   normal).
   - vit K x3 days
   - Nutrition recs
   - consult heme if INR does not reverse w/ vit K.
   #) Afib w/ RVR: Patient without RVR for 24 hours, off esmolol gtt.
   However, now on no nodal agents.  Had been on diltiazem at home.
   -decrease  diltiazem to 15 mg QID
   - Telemetry monitoring.
   - change digoxin to PO
   - check dig level today
   #) Bilateral DVT - Presented with bilateral LE swelling. Seems to have
   been on coumadin as outpt. Now s/p IVC filter placement. V/Q scan at
   OSH negative for PE.  HIT antibody negative.
   - continue heparin gtt.
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Platelets now stable. Was concern for HIT given
   decreased >50% and heparin products. HIT negative, heparin gtt
   restarted.
   # Bilateral hydronephrosis/Acute renal failure - [**2-16**] massive tumor
   compression now resolving with IVFs and s/p tumor debulking. Cr to 1.1
   today from high of 2.1 on admission.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, urine output closely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pelvic mass, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and obesity. She presents with bilateral hydronephrosis, acute renal failure, and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy. The patient is currently intubated and being diuresed due to post-operative volume overload. She has an impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and altered tissue perfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and there is concern about flash pulmonary edema without positive pressure ventilation. The plan is to extubate when the patient reaches a negative fluid balance of at least 9 liters.

2. Post-operative Hypotension: The patient's post-operative hypotension has resolved, but monitoring of hematocrit and central venous pressure (CVP) is required. The patient is on positive pressure ventilation with minimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). No evidence of sepsis is observed, and antibiotics have been discontinued.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable at around 14, likely due to the cortisol stress response post-surgery. There is no indication of infection, but further evaluation of urine and blood cultures is recommended.

4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated international normalized ratio (INR)"

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of newly diagnosed pelvic mass (likely endometrial vs ovarian CA), atrial fibrillation (AFib), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), and obesity. She presents with bilateral hydronephrosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap). The patient is currently intubated while being diuresed due to post-operative volume overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on positive pressure ventilation support. There is a risk of prolonged respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if proper care measures are not taken.

2. Post-operative Hypotension: The patient had resolved post-operative hypotension, but close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, including central venous pressure (CVP), is required to prevent recurrent hypotension.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to surgical stress response. However, it is important to rule out infection by monitoring temperature, white blood cell count, and conducting urine and blood cultures.

4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, likely due to poor nutritional status and supratherapeutic heparin administration. Vitamin K supplementation has been initiated to normalize INR levels.

5. Atrial Fibr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of newly diagnosed pelvic mass, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and obesity. She was admitted for post-operative hypotension requiring IV fluids and pressors. The patient underwent surgery for tumor debulking and is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events:
- The patient was extubated and did well throughout the day while being weaned to 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.
- Post-extubation ABG showed pH 7.42, PaCO2 34 mmHg, and PaO2 144 mmHg.
- The patient received Lasix 20 IV and had 900cc output with negative fluid balance over 1 liter.
- She passed gas, and total fluid intake was 10cc with sips of clear liquids. Residual volume was 5cc in the evening.
- A PICC line could not be placed by the IV team, so an order was made for interventional radiology for tomorrow.
- The patient was called out to the obstetrics and gynecology floor today.

Medical history:
- Allergies: Sulfur, elemental.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Metronidazole at 08:00 AM.
- Infusions: Heparin sodium at 1,250 units/hour.
- Other ICU medications: Morphine sulfate, metoprolol, digoxin, vitamin K, Colace, Zofran, Miconazole powder, paroxetine, Lipitor, amitriptyline.

","The patient is a 64-year-old female who underwent surgery for the resection of a pelvic mass and was admitted for post-operative hypotension requiring intravenous fluids (IVFs) and pressors. The patient's hypotension has now resolved, and she is undergoing diuresis after fluid resuscitation.

The patient was extubated on am rounds and tolerated it well, being weaned to 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC). A post-extubation arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 34, and PaO2 of 144. 

In the evening, the patient received lasix 20 IV and had 900cc output, leaving her negative more than 1 liter for the day. She is passing gas, so total fluid intake (TF) at 10cc was continued, and clear liquids were given in sips. Residuals were 5cc in the evening.

The patient's PICC line could not be placed by the IV team, so an order was made for interventional radiology (IR) to place it tomorrow. The patient was also called out to the obstetrics/gynecology floor today.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfur, elemental sulfur, and swelling. The last dose of antibiotics given was metronidazole at 08:00 AM. The patient is currently on several medications including heparin sodium at 1,250 units"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female who underwent surgery for the resection of a pelvic mass and is now in the ICU. She was admitted for post-operative hypotension requiring intravenous fluids and vasopressors. Her hypotension has resolved, and she is undergoing diuresis after fluid resuscitation. The patient has been extubated and is tolerating clear liquids well. She is passing gas and has a low residual volume. A PICC line could not be placed, so an order for interventional radiology (IR) was made for tomorrow. The patient is also being called out to the obstetrics/gynecology floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload: The patient received a significant amount of fluids (992 mL total in) and had a negative fluid balance (-1,148 mL) over the past 24 hours. This could potentially lead to fluid overload, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, edema, and hypertension.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state from surgery and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Signs of infection may include fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory status.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility, surgery, and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation. Symptoms may include leg swelling, pain, and redness.
4. Ventil"
