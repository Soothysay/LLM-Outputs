   thought secondary to COPD and overlying pneumonia likely secondary to
   aspiration, initially improving but now transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in the
   setting of acute respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress: Leading diagnosis remains aspiration
   pneumnia in setting of COPD. An acute aspiration event on the floor
   today, leading to an aspiration pneumonitis, is also a consideration.
   Interestingly, the pt
s CXRs have consistently shown a predomonent
   left-sided oppacification; as she has not had any cardiac work-up to
   this point, an elevent of heart failure or valvulopathy could certainly
   be contributing to her clinical picture. Less likely but still possible
   would a process such as tracheomalatia or vocal cord dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD who presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia, which was thought to be secondary to COPD and an underlying pneumonia likely due to aspiration. The patient initially improved but is now experiencing acute respiratory distress. The leading diagnosis remains aspiration pneumonia in the setting of COPD. There is also a possibility of an acute aspiration event leading to aspiration pneumonitis. Interestingly, the patient's chest X-rays have consistently shown predominant left-sided opacification, raising the possibility of cardiac issues such as heart failure or valvulopathy. Other potential causes, including tracheomalatia or vocal cord dysfunction, are less likely.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 124/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient appears uncomfortable but not in extremis. Physical examination reveals a few rhonchi throughout the chest with limited air movement, normal heart sounds, supple neck, and no signs of abdominal tenderness or distention.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, platelet count of 349 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL"

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who initially presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia. The hypoxia was initially thought to be secondary to COPD and an underlying pneumonia likely due to aspiration. However, the patient's condition improved initially but then deteriorated, leading to acute respiratory distress. She was transferred back to the ICU.

The leading diagnosis remains aspiration pneumonia in the setting of COPD. Another consideration is an acute aspiration event on the floor today, which led to aspiration pneumonitis. The patient's chest X-rays have consistently shown predominant left-sided opacification. It is also possible that an eleventh of heart failure or valvulopathy could be contributing to her clinical picture. Less likely but still possible would be a process such as tracheomalacia or vocal cord dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 124/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, normal creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The PT/PTT/INR is elevated, and the rest of the lab values are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD initially presenting with SBO and hypoxia
   thought secondary to COPD and overlying pneumonia likely secondary to
   aspiration, initially improving but now transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in the
   setting of acute respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress: Leading diagnosis remains aspiration
   pneumnia in setting of COPD. An acute aspiration event on the floor
   today, leading to an aspiration pneumonitis, is also a consideration.
   Interestingly, the pt
s CXRs have consistently shown a predomonent
   left-sided oppacification; as she has not had any cardiac work-up to
   this point, an elevent of heart failure or valvulopathy could certainly
   be contributing to her clinical picture. BNP elevated.  Less likely but
   still possible would a process such as tracheomalatia or vocal cord
   dysfunction.  Patient is also very upset at still being in hospital.
   She has been off her medications and the combination of the two may be
   causing her to act out her frustration.  Patient improved when night
   team talked her into taking slow deep breaths.
   -continue vanc/ceftriaxone/Flagyl for now (plan 8 day course; day 1 =
   [**2136-5-6**])
   -continue prednisone 60mg daily; continue albuterol and ipratropium inh
   -echo,
   -repeat CXR
   -change diet to NPO for now
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Pt remains without positive cultures. Although
   rising WBC count and low-grade fever are suggestive of infection, do
   not believe there is a clear indication to further change pt
s current
   antibiotic regimen acutely.
   -repeat cultures
   -continue current antibiotics as above
   # Drop in hematocrit: No signs/symptoms of active bleed. Unclear cause
   for drop in hct from 39
   -active type and screen
   -guiaic stools
   -recheck hct in afternoon
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: Etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  Currently resolved; pt is
   without NGT.
   -follow abdominal exam
   -will follow up speech and swallow recs for TF and PO diet.
   # Polycythemia: Resolved. Was likely due to COPD and
   hemoconcentration.  Will continue to monitor HCT, nothing more to do
   for now.
   # Bipolar Disorder: holding home meds until clinically stablilizes
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Will consider TF or TPN

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD who initially presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia. The initial improvement was thought to be secondary to COPD and underlying pneumonia likely due to aspiration. However, the patient was transferred back to the ICU in the setting of acute respiratory distress. The leading diagnosis remains aspiration pneumonia in the setting of COPD. Other considerations include acute aspiration event, cardiac issues such as heart failure or valvulopathy, tracheomalatia, or vocal cord dysfunction. The patient's BNP is elevated, indicating possible heart failure. She is also upset about still being in the hospital and may be experiencing frustration. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, and there is a low-grade fever, suggesting a possible infection. However, there is no clear indication to change her current antibiotic regimen. The patient's hematocrit level has dropped, but there are no signs or symptoms of active bleeding. The cause of the drop in hematocrit is unclear. The patient's nausea, vomiting, and SBO have resolved, but the etiology of the SBO development in this patient without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. The patient's polycythemia has resolved and was likely due to COPD and hemoconcentration. The patient is holding her home medications until she clinically stabilizes. She has a history of bipolar disorder and GERD. In the ICU, the patient is NPO for now and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD initially presenting with SBO and hypoxia
   thought secondary to COPD and overlying pneumonia likely secondary to
   aspiration, initially improving but now transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in the
   setting of acute respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress: Leading diagnosis remains aspiration
   pneumnia in setting of COPD. An acute aspiration event on the floor
   today, leading to an aspiration pneumonitis, is also a consideration.
   Interestingly, the pt
s CXRs have consistently shown a predomonent
   left-sided oppacification; as she has not had any cardiac work-up to
   this point, an elevent of heart failure or valvulopathy could certainly
   be contributing to her clinical picture. Less likely but still possible
   would a process such as tracheomalatia or vocal cord dysfunction.
   -continue vanc/ceftriaxone/Flagyl for now (plan 8 day course; day 1 =
   [**2136-5-6**])
   -continue prednisone 60mg daily; continue albuterol and ipratropium inh
   -echo, BNP today
   -repeat CXR
   -change diet to NPO for now
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Pt remains without positive cultures. Although
   rising WBC count and low-grade fever are suggestive of infection, do
   not believe there is a clear indication to further change pt
s current
   antibiotic regimen acutely.
   -repeat cultures
   -continue current antibiotics as above
   # Drop in hematocrit: No signs/symptoms of active bleed. Unclear cause
   for drop in hct from 39
   -active type and screen
   -guiaic stools
   -recheck hct in afternoon
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: Etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  Currently resolved; pt is
   without NGT.
   -follow abdominal exam
   -will follow up speech and swallow recs for TF and PO diet.
   # Polycythemia: Resolved. Was likely due to COPD and
   hemoconcentration.  Will continue to monitor HCT, nothing more to do
   for now.
   # Bipolar Disorder: holding home meds until clinically stablilizes
   # GERD: Continue PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who initially presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia. The initial improvement was seen, but now she has been transferred back to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The leading diagnosis remains aspiration pneumonia in the setting of COPD. The patient experienced an acute aspiration event on the floor today, leading to aspiration pneumonitis. Other possible contributing factors could be eleventh of heart failure or valvulopathy.

2. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient has a rising white blood cell count and low-grade fever, which are suggestive of infection. However, there is no clear indication to change the current antibiotic regimen.

3. Drop in Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit has dropped without any signs or symptoms of active bleeding. The cause for this drop is unclear. It is important to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and investigate further if the drop persists.

4. Nausea/Vomiting/SBO: The etiology of the development of SBO in this patient without prior abdominal surgery is unclear. The patient's symptoms have resolved, but it is important to follow up with an abdominal exam and speech and swallow recommendations for tube feeding and oral diet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old individual admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequent aspiration events leading to bilateral pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

Key points from the note include:

1. Acute and chronic respiratory failure: The patient has unclear etiology of respiratory failure, with possible causes such as recurrent aspiration, COPD exacerbation, or diastolic dysfunction. The patient's respiratory distress improved after being diuresed and an updated echo note BNP 2300 was ordered. The patient is to remain NPO (nothing by mouth), continue on Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl, and have FiO2 weaned while monitoring for signs of hypercarbia. NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) should be considered if necessary.

2. Anemia: The cause of anemia is uncertain, possibly due to acute blood loss. Guaiac stools should be checked to investigate further.

3. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition plan should continue as previously recommended.

4. Psych medications: Olanzapine will be restarted, and Clonazepam will be initiated today.

5. Other issues: The remaining concerns will be addressed by the housestaff.

6. ICU care: The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring. Prophylaxis for DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and stress ulcer are being provided."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 70 yo woman with known COPD initially presenting with SBO and hypoxia
   thought secondary to COPD and overlying pneumonia likely secondary to
   aspiration, initially improving but now transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] in the
   setting of acute respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress: Leading diagnosis remains aspiration
   pneumnia in setting of COPD. An acute aspiration event on the floor
   today, leading to an aspiration pneumonitis, is also a consideration.
   Interestingly, the pt
s CXRs have consistently shown a predomonent
   left-sided oppacification; as she has not had any cardiac work-up to
   this point, an elevent of heart failure or valvulopathy could certainly
   be contributing to her clinical picture. BNP elevated.  Less likely but
   still possible would a process such as tracheomalatia or vocal cord
   dysfunction.  Patient is also very upset at still being in hospital.
   She has been off her medications and the combination of the two may be
   causing her to act out her frustration.  Patient improved when night
   team talked her into taking slow deep breaths.
   -continue vanc/ceftriaxone/Flagyl for now (plan 8 day course; day 1 =
   [**2136-5-6**])
   -continue prednisone 60mg daily; continue albuterol and ipratropium inh
   -echo,
   -repeat CXR
   -change diet to NPO for now
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Pt remains without positive cultures. Although
   rising WBC count and low-grade fever are suggestive of infection, do
   not believe there is a clear indication to further change pt
s current
   antibiotic regimen acutely.
   -repeat cultures
   -continue current antibiotics as above
   # Drop in hematocrit: No signs/symptoms of active bleed. Unclear cause
   for drop in hct from 39
   -active type and screen
   -guiaic stools
   -recheck hct in afternoon
   # Nausea/vomiting/SBO: Etiology of development of SBO in this patient
   without prior abdominal surgery is unclear.  Currently resolved; pt is
   without NGT.
   -follow abdominal exam
   -will follow up speech and swallow recs for TF and PO diet.
   # Polycythemia: Resolved. Was likely due to COPD and
   hemoconcentration.  Will continue to monitor HCT, nothing more to do
   for now.
   # Bipolar Disorder: holding home meds until clinically stablilizes
   # GERD: Continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD who initially presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia. The initial improvement was followed by acute respiratory distress, leading to her transfer back to the ICU. The leading diagnosis is aspiration pneumonia, possibly secondary to COPD, and an acute aspiration event is also a consideration. Other potential contributing factors include heart failure or valvulopathy, tracheomalacia, or vocal cord dysfunction. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, leukocytosis/fever, drop in hematocrit, nausea/vomiting/SBO, polycythemia, bipolar disorder, and GERD. She is being treated with antibiotics, steroids, bronchodilators, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and liver enzymes, along with low hemoglobin and potassium levels. Imaging reveals improved right lower lobe opacity and worsening left-sided haziness on the chest X-ray. The plan includes continuing the current antibiotic regimen, repeating cultures, and conducting further diagnostic tests such as an echo, repeat CXR, and type and screen. The patient remains without positive cultures and is currently stable."

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of COPD, who initially presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia thought to be secondary to COPD and underlying pneumonia likely due to aspiration. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- She has improved significantly overnight with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and is now on a nasal cannula.
- Despite having an equivocal swallow study, there is concern about repeated episodes of dyspnea representing aspirations, and the possibility of an active aspiration pneumonia.
- She is also experiencing an active COPD exacerbation.
- The patient remains afebrile, and her white blood cell count is difficult to interpret due to steroid use.

The plan of care includes:
- Continuing vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl for now.
- Tapering prednisone from 60mg daily as tolerated and continuing albuterol and ipratropium inhalers.
- Ordering a follow-up chest X-ray in the morning.
- Continuing nasogastric tube (NG) until further evaluation by a speech therapist.
- Administering Lasix 10mg IV once.
- Repeating BNP levels.
- Implementing an insulin sliding scale for diabetes-induced hyperglycemia.

Other conditions being managed include bipolar disorder (holding home medications until clinically stable), GERD (continuing PPI),"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO) and significant aspiration events resulting in bilateral pneumonia (PNA). He was initially admitted for SBO but developed recurrent episodes of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, gait, respiration/gas exchange, and impaired skin integrity. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration and acute and chronic respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The differential includes recurrent aspiration, possibly COPD exacerbation, and diastolic dysfunction with cardiac wheezing to explain episodic respiratory distress. A chest x-ray shows worsening interstitial markings, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed to assess cardiac function. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is significantly elevated at 2300, indicating possible heart failure. Diuretics will be administered to manage fluid overload.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl. Speech and swallow therapy will be discussed due to the patient's increased tachypnea with coughing after swallowing. COPD management will involve continuing prednisone and nebulizer treatments. Close monitoring for hypercarbia is advised, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be considered if necessary.

Additional issues include anemia, which has stabilized, and the"

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with known COPD, initially presenting with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and hypoxia. She is suspected to have developed respiratory distress due to aspiration, leading to pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

Key findings from the progress note include:

- The patient had an episode of desaturation to around 85% requiring an increase in nasal cannula oxygen to 6L.
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 91, and PaO2 54.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to the risk of aspiration.
- An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 55%, mild mitral regurgitation (MR), and pulmonary artery hypertension (PA HTN).
- The patient has allergies to phenothiazines and an unknown allergy to piperacillin/tazobactam.
- She received antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole within the last 24 hours.
- The patient is on various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109"

   A 70 yo woman with known COPD initially presenting with SBO and hypoxia
   thought secondary to COPD and overlying pneumonia likely secondary to
   aspiration, returning to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for respiratory distress.  She still
   has episodes of acute desaturation associated with PO intake that can
   be managed with increased nasal o2, but no evidence that her swallowing
   has improved.
   # Aspiration Pneumonia/Pneumonitis:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8842**] continues to have
   episodes of acute desaturation to the mid-80s after any PO intake.  We
   are able to correct her with increased Nasal O2 (~6L).  She does show
   continued signs of aspiration and poor secretion management, requiring
   intermittent suction.  The patient is still unable to tolerate POs
   despite her desire to eat.  It is unclear if the aspiration is a
   chronic problem or acute (acute on chronic) from recent intubations.
   - Continued Speech & Swallow input appreciated
   - NPO, will place NG tube for Tube feeds (+ Nutrition Consult)
   - Insulin Sliding Scale for Diabetes induced hyperglycemia
   - Will discuss with patient, caregiver, PCP her wishes regarding G tube
   placement
   - All meds to oral (Prednisone->Methylprednisolone)
   - Begin Steroid taper from Prednisone 60 to Methylprednisolone 40
   (equivalent Pred 50).  Very slow taper given severity of COPD and her
   history of steroid tapers.  Continue HISS while on steroids
   # Bipolar Disorder: Convert Clonazepam to Ativan 1-2mg IV BID while NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with cognitive impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and initial admission for small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has experienced significant aspiration events leading to bilateral pneumonia and collapse. The patient is currently experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoxia and respiratory distress, which are likely multifactorial. These episodes may be due to recurrent aspiration, exacerbation of COPD, or diastolic dysfunction. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Recurrent aspiration events leading to further respiratory distress and potential pneumonia.
2. Exacerbation of COPD leading to worsening respiratory function.
3. Diastolic dysfunction causing cardiac issues and contributing to respiratory distress.
4. Possible need for legal guardianship due to the patient's cognitive impairment.
5. Potential requirement for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition if the patient continues to have difficulties with swallowing.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, including measures to prevent aspiration and treat any underlying COPD exacerbation. Additionally, her cognitive impairment and decision-making capacity should be considered, potentially leading to discussions about legal guardianship and long-term care options such as a PEG tube."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with cognitive impairment and COPD, initially admitted for small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has experienced significant aspiration events leading to bilateral pneumonia and collapse, particularly in the setting of nausea and vomiting. She is now experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoxia and respiratory distress, likely due to recurrent aspiration events.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/81 to 137/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications, including lasix, TTE, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, and elevated creatinine levels of 0.6 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal left atrial dilatation, normal left ventricular function, and mild pulmonary arterial hypertension. The chest X-ray shows stable right upper lobe infiltrate and improving left base.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical complications, including impaired aerobic capacity, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia due to aspiration, acute and chronic pain, small bowel obstruction, and t"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with cognitive impairment and COPD, initially admitted for small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has experienced multiple aspiration events leading to bilateral pneumonia and collapse, especially during episodes of nausea and vomiting. The patient's condition improved after the placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube, which prevented further aspiration and allowed for tube feeds. The patient also received diuretics, which may have helped with pulmonary edema. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/76 mmHg to 136/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's lung examination reveals diffuse rhonchi and wheezes on expiration. 

Her laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, her blood glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 102 to 198 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and kidney function, are within normal range. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to phenothiazines and a previous allergic reaction to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, resulting in a rash. She has been receiving various antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole, but only the rash associated with Cef"

   distress.
   Hypoxia and episodes of resp distress are likely multifactorial with
   recurrent aspiration highest on ddx given time course of sx in relation
   to eating, +/- COPD exacerbation and component of diastolic dysfunction
   with cardiac wheezing noting some improvement after lasix/diuresis.
   Without clear explanation for aspiration risk and unclear whether this
   is chronic or new.
   For now would place NGT for meds and possible TFs for nutrition until
   swallow can be reassessed.  If continued to be problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] a PEG tube
   will need to be addressed.
   Will discuss with pt
s PCP need for more definitive treatment such as
   PEG tube as well as pt

   with her decision making.
   Would continue Ceftriaxone/Flagyl for asp pna to complete 7 days--can

   As COPD is likely also playing role would continue pred but begin slow
   taper

   A 70 yo woman with known COPD initially presenting with SBO and hypoxia
   thought secondary to COPD and overlying pneumonia likely secondary to
   aspiration, returning to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for respiratory distress.  She still
   has episodes of acute desaturation associated with PO intake that can
   be managed with increased nasal o2, but no evidence that her swallowing
   has improved.
   # Aspiration Pneumonia/Pneumonitis:  Ms. [**Known lastname 8842**] continues to have
   episodes of acute desaturation to the mid-80s after any PO intake.  We
   are able to correct her with increased Nasal O2 (~6L).  She does show
   continued signs of aspiration and poor secretion management, requiring
   intermittent suction.  The patient is still unable to tolerate POs
   despite her desire to eat.  It is unclear if the aspiration is a
   chronic problem or acute (acute on chronic) from recent intubations.
   - Continued Speech & Swallow input appreciated
   - NPO, will place NG tube for Tube feeds (+ Nutrition Consult)

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of impaired respiration, gas exchange, balance, gait, and skin integrity. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 94 bpm with a range of 77-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/76 mmHg to 136/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute with a range of 20-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient has allergies to phenothiazines and an unknown allergy to piperacillin sodium/tazobactam, which caused a rash.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 617 mL total fluids and outputs of 2,235 mL total outputs, resulting in a negative balance of 1,618 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,235 mL, and the NG tube output is 17 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count ranging from 7.7 to 12.1 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin levels ranging from 9.2 to 10.9 g/d"

   71 yo F with cognitive impairment, copd, initial admission for SBO,
   course c/b significant aspiration events with bilateral PNA and
   collapse in setting of n/v now with recurrent episode of  hypoxia/resp
   distress.
   Recurrent aspiration highest on ddx given time course of sx in relation
   to eating, +/- COPD exacerbation which we are treating and component of
   diastolic dysfunction with cardiac wheezing noting some improvement
   after lasix/diuresis. She failed a [**5-9**] video swallow but has been
   cleared on most recent swallow study for thick nector diet. Despite
   this she has had observed aspiration when taking POs. There have been
   no recurrent events of hypoxia since pt has been NPO and following NGT
   placement.  We suspect this is either a chronic issue or that pt is
   still recovering her swallow (? Irritation or insult with intubation)
   following recent, though brief, intubation.
   Agree with plan to reassess swallow in [**1-6**] days.  For now would
   continue NGT for meds and TFs for nutrition until swallow can be
   reassessed.  Pending reassessment
issue of feeding tube may need to be
   addressed.  We are in process of clarifying obtaining health care proxy
   and or guardian to assist pt with her decision making.with help of her
   PCP and social work .
   Would continue Ceftriaxone/Flagyl for asp pna to complete 7 days. Will
   reimage chest with CT to better assess rul and L base. Remains af with

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with cognitive impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and initial admission for small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has experienced significant aspiration events leading to bilateral pneumonia and collapse in the setting of nausea and vomiting. The patient is currently experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoxia and respiratory distress, which are highest on the differential diagnosis given the time course of symptoms in relation to eating. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to phenothiazines and an unknown allergy to piperacillin/tazobactam. She has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 134/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin without rash. Neurologically, she follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and demonstrates purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, platelet count of 275 K/uL, creatinine of"

   71 yo F with cognitive impairment, copd, initial admission for SBO,
   course c/b significant aspiration events with bilateral PNA and
   collapse in setting of n/v now with recurrent episode of  hypoxia/resp
   distress.
   Recurrent aspiration highest on ddx given time course of sx in relation
   to eating, +/- COPD exacerbation which we are treating and component of
   diastolic dysfunction with cardiac wheezing noting some improvement
   after lasix/diuresis. She failed a [**5-9**] video swallow but has been
   cleared on most recent swallow study for thick nector diet. Despite
   this she has had observed aspiration when taking POs. There have been
   no recurrent events of hypoxia since pt has been NPO and following NGT
   placement.  We suspect this is either a chronic issue or that pt is
   still recovering her swallow (? Irritation or insult with intubation)
   following recent, though brief, intubation.
   Agree with plan to reassess swallow in [**1-6**] days.  For now would
   continue NGT for meds and TFs for nutrition until swallow can be
   reassessed.  Pending reassessment
issue of feeding tube may need to be

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with cognitive impairment and COPD, admitted for small bowel obstruction. She has experienced recurrent aspiration events and has developed bilateral pneumonia. The patient's current chief complaint is hypoxia and respiratory distress, which occurred during eating. The patient failed a video swallow test on day 5 but was cleared for a thick nectar diet on a recent swallow study. However, she continues to have observed aspiration while taking oral medications. Since being placed on nothing by mouth (NPO) and having a nasogastric tube (NGT) inserted, there have been no further episodes of hypoxia.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, gait, respiration/gas exchange, and impaired skin integrity. She also has pneumonia due to aspiration, pain control, and small bowel obstruction. The plan includes reassessing the patient's swallow in 1-6 days, continuing NGT for medication administration and total parenteral nutrition (TF) until the swallow can be reassessed. The healthcare proxy and guardian will be obtained to assist with decision-making. The patient will continue to receive Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia until completion of 7 days, and a CT scan of the chest will be performed to better assess the right upper lobe and left base. The patient's white blood cell count remains stable, and the slow prednisone taper will continue."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with cognitive impairment and COPD who was admitted for small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has experienced several significant aspiration events leading to bilateral pneumonia and collapse, particularly in the setting of nausea and vomiting. The patient is currently experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoxia and respiratory distress, which are likely multifactorial in nature. Factors contributing to these symptoms include recurrent aspiration, potential exacerbation of COPD, and diastolic dysfunction with cardiac wheezing. However, since being placed on nil per os (NPO) and having a nasogastric tube (NGT) inserted, the patient has not experienced any further episodes of hypoxia.

The plan moving forward includes continuing the NGT for medication administration and total parenteral nutrition (TF) until the patient's swallowing ability can be reassessed. If the issue persists, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may be necessary. The patient will also continue receiving ceftriaxone and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia for an additional 7 days. The current plan is to gradually taper the prednisone due to its potential role in exacerbating COPD.

Other ongoing care includes repletion with fiber, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer protection"

   71yF with COPD and cognitive impairment who presented initially with
   SBO, now with continued episodes of hypoxia and aspiration.
   #) Hypoxia/pneumonia/respiratory distress:  She continues to have
   episodes of significant hypoxia. Possibilities include PE (especially
   concerned given tachycardia this morning, although there is an absence
   of respiratory alkalosis), mucous plugging,  or possibly recurrent
   aspiration given clinical history and CT findings.  There was also a
   question of communication between esophagus and trachea on CT, which
   could be contributing to recurrent aspiration.   However, CXR right
   after a hypoxic event last night did not show worsening of CXR, and the
   finding on CT may be artifact.  A remote possible explanation of
   hypoxia would be intermittent R
L shunting, perhaps from PFO. Low
   suspicion for infectious etiology given lack of leukocytosis or
   fever.   She also likely has underlying COPD that is probably
   contributing.

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of COPD and cognitive impairment. She presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is now experiencing continued episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. The patient's respiratory status has been unstable with intermittent hypoxia and respiratory distress. Her oxygen saturation levels have fluctuated, initially dropping to the mid-80s on 5 liters of nasal cannula but then spontaneously improving to the mid-90s. An arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed a pH of 7.5, indicating respiratory alkalosis. A chest X-ray (CXR) showed no significant changes from earlier in the day. The patient's confusion and agitation were addressed with a small dose of haloperidol.

The patient has a history of allergies to phenothiazines and an unknown allergy to piperacillin/tazobactam, which resulted in a rash. She has received various antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. She is currently on multiple infusions, including heparin sodium, lorazepam, and haloperidol.

Her vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.3°C, heart rate (HR) of 89 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 127/66 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98"

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of COPD and cognitive impairment, presenting initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO). She is now experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. The patient also has impaired respiratory function, potentially due to underlying COPD, pneumonia, or recurrent aspiration. There is a suspicion of tracheoesophageal fistula, as indicated by the presence of a communication between the esophagus and trachea on CT scan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's recurrent episodes of significant hypoxia may lead to hypoxemia, which can cause tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's impaired respiratory function and recurrent aspiration increase the risk of developing pneumonia. This can be further complicated by her underlying COPD.

3. Tracheoesophageal fistula: The suspected tracheoesophageal fistula, indicated by the communication between the esophagus and trachea on CT scan, may contribute to recurrent aspiration and respiratory distress. This condition requires further evaluation and management.

4. Small bowel obstruction: The initial presentation of SBO can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or infection if not managed appropriately.

5. Cognitive impairment: The patient's cognitive impairment may pose challenges in managing her medical condition, communication, and decision-making regarding her care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of COPD, cognitive impairment, and a recent presentation of small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has been experiencing episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. The patient underwent a computed tomography angiography (CTA) which was unclear, so the decision was made not to continue with lovenox due to the presence of a left lower lobe mass, and there was no obvious pulmonary embolism (PE). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no patent foramen ovale (PFO). A nasogastric (NG) tube was placed, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) improved. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to 89% yesterday at 2 PM. She has allergies to phenothiazines and piperacillin sodium/tazobactam, with a known rash reaction to the latter. The patient received ceftriaxone and metronidazole antibiotics in the past, with the last dose of ceftriaxone on 05/17/2136 at 04:00 PM, and metronidazole on 05/18/2136 at 04:30 AM. She is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), and other medications as per the ICU protocol. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a"

   #) Hypoxia/pneumonia/respiratory distress:  She continues to have
   episodes of significant hypoxia. Possibilities include PE (especially
   concerned given tachycardia this morning, although there is an absence
   of respiratory alkalosis), mucous plugging,  or possibly recurrent
   aspiration given clinical history and CT findings.  There was also a
   question of communication between esophagus and trachea on CT, which
   could be contributing to recurrent aspiration.   However, CXR right
   after a hypoxic event last night did not show worsening of CXR, and the
   finding on CT may be artifact.  A remote possible explanation of

L shunting, perhaps from PFO. Low

","The patient's medical progress note indicates several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Impaired respiration/gas exchange: The patient has impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, gait, and respiration/gas exchange. This could be due to pneumonia, aspiration, or tracheomalacia.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level (SpO2) is 100% on nasal cannula, indicating that they may have hypoxemia, which could be related to the impaired respiration/gas exchange.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with partial opacification of the left lower lobe bronchus. An obstructing lesion cannot be excluded, and bronchoscopy is recommended for further evaluation.

4. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): There is no direct evidence of SBO in the provided information. However, the patient has a history of chronic pain and small bowel obstruction, including intussusception, adhesions.

5. Tracheomalacia: The patient has marked tracheomalacia, which can contribute to respiratory difficulties.

6. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy: This is likely reactive and may not indicate a serious complication.

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may require special attention and care.

   Assessment and Plan
   71yF with COPD and cognitive impairment who presented initially with
   SBO, now with continued episodes of hypoxia and aspiration.
   #) Hypoxia/pneumonia/respiratory distress:  Patient had one desat
   yesterday. PE unlikely given negative LENIs and clinical picture though
   CTA non-diagnostic, PFO ruled out with TTE w/bubble study, unlikely
   recurrent aspiration as patient NPO. .    Low suspicion for infectious
   etiology given lack of leukocytosis or fever.    CXR appears to have
   mucous plugging/collapse of the lllobe which is likely just mucous
   plugging, but if patient does not improve may need bronch to rule out
   malignancy. She also likely has underlying COPD that is probably
   contributing.
   - currently on a slow steroid taper for COPD; plan to continue current
   dose for now
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers
   - chest physical therapy
   - Add Mucomyst 10% TID
   -Put on humidified 02
   -sit patient in chair, allow her to take fluids as aspiration unlikely.
   - follow CXR
   - will hold off on barium study to evaluate for fistula for now
   .
   #) Rash:  reportedly unchanged
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Nausea/vomiting/SBO: Resolved.
   .
   #) Bipolar disorder:  - continue Ativan and olanzapine
   .
   #) Access. PICC.
   .
   #) Code. Full code. Awaiting guardianship.
   .
   #) Dispo. [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for now.
   - discuss guardianship issues with social work

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 8842**] had had episodic desaturation overnight but denies
   respiratory distress. she has had minimal secretion output too. She is
   eager to eat.
   Exam notable for edentulous WF with dry mucous membranes, diminished
   breath sounds left > right, scant edema and distant heart sounds. Tm of
   99.4 BP of 113/60 HR 74 RR 14 with sats of 95%  on 3lpm .
   Labs notable for WBC  8.8K, HCT 37 , K+ 4 , Cr 0.6 , ABG with met
   alkalosis( Ph of 7.47). CXR with left LL atelectasis/ PNA . No evidence
   for PE.
   Agree with plan to slowly advance diet, provide humidified O2, help
   with secretion clearance( mucomyst, acapella) and maintain strict
   aspiration precautions. She will transition to a chair today nd
   possibly the floor later today. She has extensive underlying COPD (
   FEV1 of  0.77 in [**2133**]) and will likely need home O2 too. continue slow
   steroid taper.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of COPD and cognitive impairment who presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is now experiencing episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and respiratory distress, and further evaluation is needed to rule out malignancy. The patient has a rash, nausea/vomiting, and a resolved SBO. She also has bipolar disorder and is on medication for it. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/pneumonia/respiratory distress: The patient's episodes of desaturation and respiratory distress indicate a potential risk of worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. This can be exacerbated by underlying COPD and mucous plugging/collapse of the left lower lobe seen on the chest X-ray.
2. Recurrent aspiration: Despite being on a nil per os (NPO) status, the patient's aspiration risk may still be present due to her cognitive impairment and difficulty with secretion clearance. This increases the risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
3. Malignancy: The partial opacification of the left lower lobe bronchus seen on the CT scan raises the possibility of an obstructing lesion, potentially malignancy. Further evaluation through bronchoscopy is recommended.
4. Bipolar disorder: The patient's bipolar disorder requires ongoing management and monitoring for any potential psychiatric complications.

   71yF with COPD and cognitive impairment who presented initially with

   yesterday. PE unlikely given negative LENIs and clinical picture though
   CTA non-diagnostic, PFO ruled out with TTE w/bubble study, unlikely
   recurrent aspiration as patient NPO. .    Low suspicion for infectious
   etiology given lack of leukocytosis or fever.    CXR appears to have
   mucous plugging/collapse of the lllobe which is likely just mucous
   plugging, but if patient does not improve may need bronch to rule out
   malignancy. She also likely has underlying COPD that is probably
   contributing.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of COPD and cognitive impairment. She initially presented with a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and has since experienced continued episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including a computed tomography angiogram (CTA), which was non-diagnostic for pulmonary embolism (PE). A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) ruled out a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 123/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is receiving various medications, including heparin for prophylaxis, lorazepam, and other ICU medications.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 339 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 121 mg/dL, and normal creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal multifocal pneumonia, partial opacification of the left lower lobe bronchus, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, mild pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of COPD and cognitive impairment. She presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and now has continued episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/56 mmHg to 134/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Neurologically, she is alert and oriented but does not follow complex commands.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), troponin-T, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++). Other lab values such as glucose, creatinine (Cr), and cardiac enzymes are also within normal ranges.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman with COPD and cognitive impairment. She presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and now has continued episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, with a heart rate between 106-119 bpm, and low blood pressure ranging from 114-127/56-100 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is at 94%. The patient is on a venti mask for respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, troponin T, total CO2, glucose, and electrolytes. However, her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is elevated at 39.0 mg/dL. The patient's medical history includes allergies to phenothiazines, piperacillin sodium/tazobactam, and an adverse reaction to ceftriaxone.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, normal heart sounds, diffuse rhonchorous breath sounds, a maculopapular rash on the buttocks, and alertness with orientation but difficulty following complex commands. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of COPD and cognitive impairment who was initially admitted with a small bowel obstruction (SBO). She is currently in the ICU for continued episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she remains on respiratory support with an oxygen saturation level of 95%. She has a maculo-papular rash on her buttocks and is experiencing intermittent hypoxia in the 70's. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count and troponin T levels, but other lab results are within normal range. Her imaging shows an improved right midline in place with slight right lower lobe fluid and a prominent aortic knob/pulmonary arterial knob. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/pneumonia/respiratory distress: The patient's intermittent hypoxia and known COPD increase the risk of pneumonia and respiratory distress. Mucus plugging and possible left lower lobe pneumonia should be considered, and measures to prevent further respiratory compromise should be continued.

2. Aspiration: Given the patient's episodes of aspiration, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia or worsening respiratory status. Advance diet back to pureed solids will be closely monitored for excessive coughing or clinical evidence of aspiration.

3. Thromboembolic events: With immobilization in the ICU, there is an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylaxis with subcutaneous UF heparin is being provided, but systemic anticoagulation is currently not indicated.

4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and repeated cultures will help identify any potential infections.

5. Cardiac issues: The elevated troponin T level suggests possible cardiac involvement, such as myocardial injury or ischemia. Further cardiac evaluation and monitoring are necessary to rule out any significant cardiac events.

6. Skin breakdown: The maculo-papular rash on the patient's buttocks may progress to pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization and impaired mobility.

7. Cognitive impairment: The patient's cognitive impairment increases the risk of complications related to medication administration, understanding medical instructions, and decision-making capacity.

8. Medication reactions/allergic reactions: The patient has a known allergy to phenothiazines and a rash related to piperacillin/tazobactam. Close monitoring for any new medication reactions or allergic responses is essential.

Overall, the patient is at risk for respiratory complications, thromboembolic events, infections, cardiac issues, skin breakdown, cognitive impairment, medication reactions, and allergic reactions."

   recurrent mucous plugging with LLL pneumonia possibly secondary to
   aspiration.  Because of her underlying bad COPD, she has little
   reserve.  Investigation into other causes has not been revealing,
   including negative LENIs and non-diagnostic CTA, TTE without evidence
   of PFO.  Antibiotics stopped 2 days ago given low suspicion of
   infectious etiology and that she had completed her course for
   aspiration pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of COPD and cognitive impairment. She presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and now has ongoing episodes of hypoxia and aspiration. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration. She is on a slow steroid taper for her COPD, and her diet has been advanced back to pureed solids. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), and olanzapine. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she continues to experience episodes of hypoxia and respiratory distress. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, pneumonia, and further episodes of aspiration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of COPD and cognitive impairment. She presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is now experiencing recurrent hypoxia and aspiration. The patient has been on a slow steroid taper for COPD, and other treatments include albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, chest physical therapy, mucomyst 10% TID, and advanced diet back to pureed solids. The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, impaired respiratory function, impaired skin integrity, and potential small bowel obstruction. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent hypoxia and aspiration can lead to respiratory distress and worsening of the patient's COPD. This may result in further impairment of respiratory function and increased risk of pneumonia.
2. The presence of impaired skin integrity indicates a risk for pressure ulcers or bedsores. Proper skin care and repositioning are crucial to prevent these complications.
3. Small bowel obstruction may lead to complications such as intestinal ischemia, perforation, or necrosis if not managed promptly.
4. The patient's cognitive impairment and ongoing management of bipolar disorder require close monitoring of her mental status and appropriate continuation of medications like Ativan and olanzapine.
5. As the patient is on a slow steroid taper for COPD, monitoring for steroid-related side effects such as mood changes, weight gain,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxemia. The patient has a history of phenothiazine allergy and rash from piperacillin sodium/tazobactam. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and lorazepam (Ativan). Other medications include ICU medications, which are not specified. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, gait, respiration/gas exchange, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/67 to 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal creatinine levels. Imaging and microbiology results are not available. The patient is diagnosed with hypoxemia, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, gait, respiration/gas exchange, impaired skin integrity, potential pneumonia due to aspiration, pain control, small bowel obstruction, and other unspecified problems.

   71y F with severe COPD and cognitive impairment who presented initially
   with SBO, then with repeated episodes of hypoxia attributed initially
   to aspiration and now to mucus plugging.
   #) Hypoxia/pneumonia/respiratory distress:  Most likely cause is
   recurrent mucous plugging with LLL pneumonia possibly related to
   aspiration.  Because of her underlying bad COPD, she has little
   reserve.  Investigation into other causes has not been revealing,
   including negative LENIs and non-diagnostic CTA, TTE without evidence
   of PFO.  Antibiotics stopped 2 days ago given low suspicion of
   infectious etiology and that she had completed her course for
   aspiration pneumonia.
   - currently on a slow steroid taper for COPD; transition to prednisone
   30mg QD to be tapered over 2-3 weeks.
   - continue albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers as needed
   - continue chest physical therapy and aim to place in pulm rehab
   - continue dysphagia diet; will d/c if excessive coughing/clinical
   evidence fo aspiration; as per S+S needs to be re-evaluated at rehab
   - repeat CXR
   - conitnue supplemental O2: 4LNC, apparently pt was on face mask
   overnight, but did not require it to maintain sats above 90%
   .
   #) Tachycardia:. Although her HR is generally over 100, has been in
   120s-130s overnight.
   - repeat EKG: Sinus tachy on 12-lead with frequent atrial ectopy
   - small trial of fluid bolus although pt not obviously dry on exam,
   monitor for improvement
   - PE always a poosiblilty but pt has been persistently on SQH and had
   negative LENIs last weeka and a CTA which was non-diagnostic.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe COPD and cognitive impairment. She presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and repeated episodes of hypoxia attributed to aspiration and now to mucus plugging. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has a history of recurrent mucous plugging leading to lower left lobe pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration. This can cause impaired gas exchange and oxygenation.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of recurrent mucous plugging and LLL pneumonia suggests the possibility of pneumonia. This can further worsen the patient's respiratory status and gas exchange.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently above 100 beats per minute, ranging from the 120s to 130s overnight. This may be due to the underlying COPD, hypoxemia, or other factors. It should be monitored closely.

4. Skin integrity: The patient has an existing rash over the buttocks, which needs to be monitored for any signs of progression or worsening.

5. Nausea/Vomiting/SBO: Although resolved at the moment, there is a history of small bowel obstruction. Monitoring for any recurrence of symptoms is important.

6. Bipolar disorder: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, for which she is currently receiving medication. Proper management of her psychiatric condition is crucial.

   recurrent mucous plugging with LLL pneumonia possibly related to
   aspiration.  Because of her underlying COPD, she has little reserve.

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe COPD and cognitive impairment. She presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO), then with repeated episodes of hypoxia attributed initially to aspiration and now to mucus plugging. The patient has impaired respiratory function, including impaired gas exchange and impaired respiration due to her underlying COPD. She also has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration. 

The patient's current medications include albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers as needed, chest physical therapy, and a slow steroid taper for COPD. She is also on a dysphagia diet and receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. 

The patient's recent laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes. However, her blood glucose levels have been elevated, ranging from 110 to 144 mg/dL. Her imaging studies reveal persistent opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the lower lung and pleural effusion, which may indicate pneumonia. 

The patient's ongoing problems include hypoxemia, impaired balance, impaired gait, pain control (acute pain and chronic pain), small bowel obstruction, tachycardia, and rash. 

The assessment and plan include continuing chest physical therapy and aiming to place the patient in pulmonary rehabilitation. Repeat chest X-ray is recommended, along with continuation of supplemental oxygen. The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with an admission diagnosis of pneumonia and sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has shown some improvement but still has ongoing medical complications. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103 to 148/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt). The hemoglobin (Hct) level has increased from 35.5% to 44.1% during the hospital stay. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging shows improvement in left lower lobe atelectasis and decreased pleural effusion compared to previous days. There are no new focal opacities indicating pulmonary edema.

The patient's microbiology results indicate orders for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) testing and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening. However, the C. diff test has not been sent yet.

   71y F with severe COPD and cognitive impairment who presented initially
   with SBO, then with repeated episodes of hypoxia attributed initially
   to aspiration and now to mucus plugging.
   #) Hypoxia/pneumonia/respiratory distress:  Most likely cause is
   recurrent mucous plugging with LLL pneumonia possibly related to
   aspiration.  Because of her underlying COPD, she has little reserve.
   Investigation into other causes has not been revealing, including
   negative LENIs and non-diagnostic CTA, TTE without evidence of PFO.
   Antibiotics stopped given low suspicion of infectious etiology and that
   she had completed her course for aspiration pneumonia.
   - currently on a slow steroid taper for COPD; transition to prednisone
   30mg QD to be tapered over 2-3 weeks.
   - continue albuterol nebs, trial of spiriva today; if fails, will
   restart ipratropium
   - continue chest physical therapy and aim to place in pulm rehab
   - continue dysphagia diet; will d/c if excessive coughing/clinical
   evidence fo aspiration; as per S+S needs to be re-evaluated at rehab
   - repeat CXR QOD to monitor LLL opacity.
   - conitnue supplemental O2: 4LNC, apparently pt was on face mask
   overnight, but did not require it to maintain sats above 90%

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe COPD and cognitive impairment. She presented initially with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and repeated episodes of hypoxia attributed to aspiration and mucus plugging. She now has pneumonia in the left lower lobe (LLL) possibly related to aspiration. The patient has completed her course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, and investigation into other causes of hypoxia has not been revealing. She is currently on a slow steroid taper for COPD exacerbation, and her current medications include albuterol nebs, trial of spiriva, chest physical therapy, and dysphagia diet. She will be placed in pulmonary rehabilitation and will have repeat chest X-rays every other day to monitor LLL opacity. She is also on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's repeated episodes of hypoxia and pneumonia in the LLL indicate an ongoing risk for hypoxemia. This can lead to decreased oxygen supply to vital organs and may result in organ damage or failure if not managed promptly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's current pneumonia in the LLL increases her risk of developing respiratory complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics and supportive care are crucial.
3. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): Although the patient's SBO has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence or development of new"
