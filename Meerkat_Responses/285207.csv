","The patient is a 29-year-old male with a history of posterior arterial nosebleed, which has been persistent and uncontrolled despite previous interventions. He has been diagnosed with acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding). The patient's hemodynamic stability and lack of transfusion dependency indicate that he is not in immediate danger. However, there is no clear etiology for his bleed, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the source of the bleeding.

The patient's current medications include cefazolin, which will be continued while the balloon in place. Interventional Neuroradiology is aware of the patient's condition and will proceed with emergent embolization if there is any increase in bleeding. Otherwise, they will re-evaluate the patient tomorrow.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 125/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals well-appearing, well-nourished appearance with no acute distress. There is a balloon in place in the right nostril, dried blood around both nostrils, and no active bleeding. The patient's neurological examination is normal, with alertness, orientation, and intact cranial nerves.

The patient's lab results show a hematocrit of 31.8%, leukocyte count of 21200/mm³, platelet count of 220000/mm³, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 134 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. The coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR) is within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes monitoring for any signs of rebleeding, maintaining the balloon in place, and keeping the patient NPO with IVF maintenance. The healthcare team will continue to monitor the patient's Hct levels and transfuse if necessary to maintain a goal of >21%. Additionally, the patient will undergo a thorough evaluation to identify the underlying cause of the bleeding and develop an appropriate management plan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient may experience increased bleeding despite the current interventions in place. This could lead to further blood loss, decreased hemoglobin levels, and potential complications related to hypovolemia.
2. Infection: The presence of a balloon in the nostril may increase the risk of infection if proper sterile techniques are not maintained.
3. Thrombosis: Long-term indwelling of the balloon could potentially lead to thrombosis in the arterial supply of the nose.
4. Hypotension: If the patient were to experience significant blood loss or develop anemia, it could result in hypotension and compromised organ perfusion.
5. Kidney injury: Due to the patient's low blood pressure and potential blood loss, there is a risk of kidney injury if adequate perfusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male with a history of posterior arterial nosebleed. He presented to the emergency department with multiple visits and was diagnosed with a posterior arterial nosebleed at a previous hospital. A balloon was placed, but he continued to bleed, resulting in a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 39.2 to 33.8. He was transferred for possible embolization. The patient has remained hemodynamically stable and is not transfusion-dependent. There is no evidence of coagulopathy with normal INR/PTT. No prior history of bleeding or family history of bleeding was reported. The patient denied trauma, foreign objects, and drug abuse. Other possibilities include a mass in the nasal cavity or vascular anomaly that could be the source of bleeding. Although no evidence was found when ENT visualized the bleed, no clear etiology for the bleed has been identified.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient has been experiencing ongoing bleeding despite the placement of a balloon. There is a possibility of further bleeding episodes, which may require additional interventions such as placing another balloon in the left nostril or embolization.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 39.2 to 33.8, indicating acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and consideration of transfusion may be necessary to maintain a target hemoglobin level of >21.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is not currently experiencing any acute distress. There have been no further episodes of bleeding, and the hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 33% to 30% due to intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 114/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,330 mL and output of 330 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,000 mL. Blood products have been transfused, but the exact amount is not specified. Urine output is 300 mL, and there has been no significant drainage from the nasogastric (NG) tube or other drains. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen with an ABG showing partial pressures of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate within normal limits. The physical examination reveals dilated pupils, clear oropharynx without blood, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, absence of lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Neurological examination is incomplete. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (Plt)"

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date. I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan. I would add/emphasize the following: epistaxis controlled, will
   need balloon tamponade x 5 days per ENT. Exam unremarkable except
   fortachycardia in 120s when standing. Acute blood loss anemia with
   stable hct overnight. No evidence of active bleeding. Agree that
hallucinations
 are likely related to sleep onset REM given sleep
   deprivation over past few days. Stable to transfer to tele. Time spent

","The patient's condition remains stable with no further bleeding. The hematocrit (Hct) has decreased from 33.1 to 30.4, likely due to acute blood loss. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/69 to 126/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH 7.29, PaCO2 29 mmHg, PaO2 103 mmHg, and HCO3- 30.4 mEq/L. The patient has dilated pupils and no evidence of active bleeding. The review of systems is unchanged except for hallucinations, which are likely related to sleep onset REM sleep due to sleep deprivation over the past few days. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. The plan is to continue balloon tamponade for epistaxis control, start diet and plan for floor transfer, continue cefazolin, monitor hematocrit daily, and follow up on hallucinations with sleep management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 29 year-old male with no past medical history of
   who presents with posterior arterial nose bleed.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Posterior Arterial Nosebleed: Pt with nosebleed since [**3-14**] with
   multiple visits the ED.  He was diagnosed with a posterior arterial
   nosebleed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] and a balloon was placed.  He was seen by ENT
   and given his continued bleeding and Hct drop (39.2 to 33.8) he was
   transferred for possible embolization.  He has remained hemodynamically
   stable and is not transfusion dependent.  Pt with no evidence of
   coagulopathy with normal INR/PTT. No prior history of bleeding and no
   family history of bleeding.  Patient denied trauma, foreign objects and
   drug abuse. Other possibilities include mass in the nasal cavity or
   vascular anomaly that could be source of bleeding. Although, no
   evidence when ENT visualized the bleed. No clear etiology for his
   bleed.
   -- Discussed with ENT and will keep balloon in place. Pt will have some
   continued bleeding, but if increased bleeding may need to place another
   balloon in left nostril. ENT to see patient and will f/u any additional
   recs
   -- Cont Cefazolin while balloon in place
   -- Interventional Neuroradiology aware of patient. Currently, if
   hemodynamically stable and not bleeding then will hold off on emergent
   embolization today.  If rebleeds then will re-contact and proceed with
   embolization, otherwise will re-evaluate tomorrow
   -- Neuroradiology will let us know if patient needs CT-angio
   -- Cont balloon in place
   -- will keep NPO, with IVF maintenence
   -- Monitor q8 Hct, transfuse Hct goal >21
   -- T&S with 3U cross-matched
   -- 2 large bore IV
   -- keep head forward and suctioning to prevent aspiration of blood
   .
   #[**Name (NI) 11251**] Per pt gets these over past few nights when falling
   asleep, visual and auditory; but when opens eyes they go away; presume

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male with no past medical history who presents with posterior arterial nosebleed. The nosebleed started on [**3-14**] and has been previously diagnosed at Hospital1 [**Location (un) 3**]. A balloon was placed, and the patient was seen by ENT. However, the bleeding continued, and the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 39.2 to 33.8. The patient was transferred for possible embolization. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and is not transfusion-dependent. There is no evidence of coagulopathy with normal INR/PTT. The patient denies trauma, foreign objects, and drug abuse. Other possibilities for the bleeding include a mass in the nasal cavity or a vascular anomaly. Although no clear etiology for the bleed has been identified, ENT will continue to monitor the patient and may consider placing another balloon in the left nostril if increased bleeding occurs. The patient will be kept NPO with IVF maintenance, and their Hct will be monitored every 8 hours. Transfusion will be considered if the Hct drops below 21. The patient also experiences visual and auditory hallucinations when falling asleep, which are believed to be related to sleep deprivation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding from the posterior arterial nosebleed.
2. Development of anemia due to ongoing blood loss.
3. Potential need for embol"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 29 year-old male with no past medical history of
   who presents with posterior arterial nose bleed.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Posterior Arterial Nosebleed: Pt with nosebleed since [**3-14**] with
   multiple visits the ED.  He was diagnosed with a posterior arterial
   nosebleed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] and a balloon was placed.  He was seen by ENT
   and given his continued bleeding and Hct drop (39.2 to 33.8) he was
   transferred for possible embolization.  He has remained hemodynamically
   stable and is not transfusion dependent.  Pt with no evidence of
   coagulopathy with normal INR/PTT. No prior history of bleeding and no
   family history of bleeding.  Patient denied trauma, foreign objects and
   drug abuse. Other possibilities include mass in the nasal cavity or
   vascular anomaly that could be source of bleeding. Although, no
   evidence when ENT visualized the bleed. No clear etiology for his
   bleed.
   -- Discussed with ENT and will keep balloon in place. Pt will have some
   continued bleeding, but if increased bleeding may need to place another
   balloon in left nostril. ENT to see patient and will f/u any additional
   recs
   -- Cont Cefazolin while balloon in place
   -- Interventional Neuroradiology aware of patient. Currently, if
   hemodynamically stable and not bleeding then will hold off on emergent
   embolization today.  If rebleeds then will re-contact and proceed with
   embolization, otherwise will re-evaluate tomorrow
   -- Neuroradiology will let us know if patient needs CT-angio
   -- Cont balloon in place
   -- will keep NPO, with IVF maintenence
   -- Monitor Hct daily, transfuse Hct goal >21
   -- T&S with 3U cross-matched
   -- 2 large bore IV
   -- keep head forward and suctioning to prevent aspiration of blood

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 29-year-old male with no past medical history.
- He presents with a posterior arterial nosebleed since March 14th.
- The patient was diagnosed with a posterior arterial nosebleed at a previous hospital and had a balloon placed.
- He was seen by ENT and given his continued bleeding and Hct drop, he was transferred for possible embolization.
- The patient has remained hemodynamically stable and is not transfusion dependent.
- His lab results show normal INR/PTT, indicating no evidence of coagulopathy.
- Other possibilities include a mass in the nasal cavity or vascular anomaly that could be the source of bleeding.
- No clear etiology for the bleed has been identified.
- The plan is to keep the balloon in place, discuss with ENT, continue cefazolin while the balloon is in place, and monitor Hct daily.
- The patient will be kept NPO, with IVF maintenance, and will have head forward positioning and suctioning to prevent aspiration of blood.
- The patient also experiences visual and auditory hallucinations at night, which are presumed to be due to sleep deprivation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding from the posterior arterial nosebleed.
2. Anemia secondary to acute blood loss.
3. Aspiration of blood due to the patient's head forward positioning and inability to protect the airway.
4. Infection due to prolonged balloon placement and potential entry"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently stable with no further hallucinations. The patient has a history of epistaxis (nosebleed) for which a balloon was placed and is being monitored closely due to the risk of a vagal episode. The patient also has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, but the hemoglobin level is stable. The patient's hallucinations have resolved, likely due to sleep deprivation.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/80 to 124/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving fluid infusions.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolyte levels. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are slightly elevated, while the rest of the liver function tests and blood gases are within normal range.

The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient is currently receiving cefazolin, colace, and senna as part of their ICU care. The plan is to hold off on subcutaneous heparin and encourage ambulation.
