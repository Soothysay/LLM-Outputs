","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis/ESLD and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presenting with hypotension and falls. He has been in the ICU since admission, where he required three pressors overnight. His white blood cell count increased from 55K to 93K overnight. The patient's family has discussed code status and has chosen do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates potential inadequate organ perfusion and increased risk of organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Falls: The patient's falls may be due to hypotension or other factors, increasing the risk of injury and complications.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent sepsis.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's history of NASH cirrhosis/ESLD puts him at risk for liver failure, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
5. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): The presence of metastatic HCC indicates advanced-stage cancer, which can lead to complications related to tumor growth, spread, and treatment options.
6. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests impaired renal function,"

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and metastatic HCC presenting with hypotension and falls. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple pressors, including norepinephrine, vasopressin, and dopamine. He has an increased WBC count and a recent C. diff infection. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 95/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals general cachexia, confusion, and mild ascites without rebound or guarding. His neurologic examination shows alertness with poor attention and short-term memory. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following: 

1. Hypotension: The patient is in severe septic shock, hypotension not responsive to IV fluids, and presented to the ED on two pressors. He is also hypothermic with an increase in his baseline leukocytosis and 5% bandemia. The differential diagnosis includes infectious causes such as C. diff or SBP, but other causes like relative adrenal insufficiency or cardiogenic shock are less likely. 

2. Infection: Empiric"

   associated leukemoid reaction seems most likely.  Rapid rise to 90K
   overnight is unusual, especially in setting of no stool, absence of
   bowel movements does raise concern for toxic megacolon. Abd is
   distented and tender but dose not clinically appear consistent with
   peritonitis.  No free air on CXR.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESL (end-stage liver disease), and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He presented to the ICU with hypotension and falls. The patient has been on multiple pressors overnight and has shown an increase in white blood cell count from 55K to 93K. The patient's family has chosen a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C, heart rate 63 bpm, blood pressure 95/43 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals mild confusion, distended abdomen with ascites, and pale skin with multiple cherry angiomas and telangiectasias. 

Laboratory results show elevated leukocyte count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an INR of 1.5. 

The patient's assessment and plan include severe septic shock due to an infectious cause, likely Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, refractory ascites, and metastatic HCC. The patient is"

","Based on the provided progress note, it appears that the patient is currently in the ICU with ongoing monitoring and treatment. The note summarizes the patient's medical history, current vital signs, respiratory support, physical examination findings, lab results, imaging studies, and ongoing care plan.

From the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is receiving respiratory support, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia due to prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and the use of certain medications in the ICU can predispose patients to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Hospital-acquired infections: Being in an ICU setting increases the risk of acquiring infections, including bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.

It is important for the medical team to closely monitor the patient and take appropriate measures to prevent these complications."

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), refractory ascites, and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He presented to the emergency department with severe septic shock, hypotension, hypothermia, and increased leukocytosis with a 5% bandemia. The patient's current condition includes confusion, mild hypothermia, tachycardia, normal blood oxygen saturation, and stable hemodynamics with a central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-12 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of severe septic shock, hypotension, hypothermia, and leukocytosis suggests an ongoing infection. It is important to continue broad coverage for severe sepsis with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has a history of recent C. diff infection and is currently being treated empirically with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. Monitoring for development of toxic megacolon is essential.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and altered mental status may be related to his ESLD. Lactulose should be held temporarily due to the likelihood of colitis.

4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. Close monitoring of"

   Assessment and Plan
   84M with ESLD with refractory ascites and metastatic HCC, recent c.
   diff p/w falls, hypotension, hypothermia.
   .
   PLAN:
   .
   #Hypotension:
   Pt was in severe septic shock, hypotension not responsive to IVF,
   presented to ED on 2 pressors, hypothermic with increase in his
   baseline leukocytosis with 5% bandemia.  Ddx most likely infectious
   with possible sources c. diff (especially given recent c. diff
   infection, ongoing abx use for SBP ppx, diarrhea and leukocytosis),
   SBP.  PNA unlikely given minimal 02 requirement and nl CT and CXR.  UA
   is bland, no meningeal signs or focal neuro findings to suggest a CNS
   infection, no evidence skin infection.  Alternative etiologies for
   hypotension include relative adrenal insufficiency especially in
   setting of known malignancy with new adrenal lesion on CT. Cardiogenic
   shock unlikely given unchanged ecg, negative CEs and no evidence of CHF
   on CXR or exam.  PE also unlikely in this liver patient with
   coagulopathy, also not hypoxic on exam, not tachycardic.
   --send C.diff samples
   --empiric coverage for severe c. diff with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl
   --close monitoring for development of toxic megacolon
   --broad coverage for severe sepsis with vancomycin IV and zosyn
   --UA negative, f/u cultures
   --ascites fluid negative for SBP, follow up gram stain and cultures
   --follow up blood cultures.
   .
   -Septic shock
   --IVF (use NS despite hyperchloremic acidosis as LR contraindicated in
   ESLD, hyperkalemia, hypernatremia)to keep CVP 8-12, UOP ~50cc/hour
   --Tx to keep hct >30
   --continue to work on weaning levophed, goal MAP>65
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Appreciate heme input. Appears most likely etiology is response to
   infection. Will re-check LAP and send flow cytometry. Improved today.
   .
   #ESLD: Hx of NASH cirrhosis c/b metastatic HCC s/p RFA.
   -appreciate liver input
   -expectant management of fluid shift/possible need for therapeutic tap
   -hold lactulose for now given likely colitis
   -folic acid/thiamine
   -f/u peritoneal fluid as above
   -holding nadolol in setting of hypotension
   .
   #GIB:
   Pt has h/o portal hypertension with known varices, also with known
   cecal AVMs p/w guaiac + brown stool and Hct below baseline at 23.7,
   baseline per review of OMR high 20s low 30s.
   -d/w liver team, agree with mgmt thus far
   -tx to goal >30
   -Q8 hour HCT
   -hold ASA
   -IV BID PPI
   .
   #ARF:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and refractory ascites. He also has metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a history of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis, for which he underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The patient presented to the emergency department with severe septic shock, hypotension, and hypothermia. He was already on two pressors and showed an increase in baseline leukocytosis with a 5% bandemia.

The differential diagnosis for his hypotension includes infectious causes such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, especially given his recent C. diff infection, ongoing antibiotic use for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis, diarrhea, and leukocytosis. Other possible sources of infection include SBP. Pneumonia is unlikely due to minimal oxygen requirement and normal chest X-ray and CT scan results. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is also unlikely given the bland urinalysis and absence of meningeal signs or focal neurologic findings to suggest a central nervous system (CNS) infection. There is no evidence of skin infection either.

Alternative etiologies for hypotension include relative adrenal insufficiency, especially in the setting of known malignancy with a new adrenal lesion on CT. Cardiogenic shock is unlikely given the"

   Pt had hypotension not responsive to fluid rescusitation, at one point
   with 3-pressor requirement. Was hypothermic with rapidly elevating
   WBC.  Overal picture most likely consistent with infection/septic
   shock.  Potential sources include peritoneal fluid, urine, PNA, c.
   diff.  No evidence CNS infection by exam.  Peritoneal fluid negative
   for SBP, no 02 requirement, CXR clear. UA and Cx neg. Blood cx neg. Pt
   had recent c. diff infection in [**Month (only) 591**], was treated as outpatient with PO
   vanc, receipt of prescription confirmed with pharmacy.  Still at high
   risk for recurrent c. diff, leukocytosis c/w this.  exam.
   -- initial c. diff toxin screen negative, will repeat x 3, also will
   contact lab about sending cytotoxic assay as more sensitive.
   --Continue to cover for severe c. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanc.
   --Given that pt improved on current abx regimen, and was critically ill
   will continue empiric IV vanc and zosyn while continuing to look for
   source.
   -- Continue to follow up cultures.
   -- Wean down pressors as tolerated
   -- If WBC remains elevated in face of abx treatment, consider tagged
   WBC scan to determine occult etiology for infection.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He has a history of refractory ascites and c. diff infection. The patient presented with hypotension, hypothermia, and rapidly elevating white blood cell count, which suggests an infection/septic shock. Potential sources include peritoneal fluid, urine, pneumonia, and c. diff. No evidence of CNS infection is noted. The patient's recent c. diff infection was treated with oral vancomycin, but he remains at high risk for recurrent c. diff. Leukocytosis is likely due to the response to infection. The patient's condition has improved on the current antibiotic regimen, so he will continue empiric IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam while looking for the source of infection. WBC count is expected to improve with antibiotic treatment.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension not responsive to fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressor support. This suggests septic shock due to an unknown infection source.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may be a response to infection. Further investigations, such as LAP and flow cytometry, will be done to determine the cause.
3. ESLD: The patient has a history of NASH cirrhosis with metastatic HCC treated with"

   .
   PLAN:
   #Hypotension:
   Pt was in severe septic shock, hypotension not responsive to IVF,
   presented to ED on 2 pressors, hypothermic with increase in his
   baseline leukocytosis with 5% bandemia.  Ddx most likely infectious
   with possible sources c. diff (especially given recent c. diff
   infection, ongoing abx use for SBP ppx, diarrhea and leukocytosis),
   SBP.  PNA unlikely given minimal 02 requirement and nl CT and CXR.  UA
   is bland, no meningeal signs or focal neuro findings to suggest a CNS
   infection, no evidence skin infection.  Alternative etiologies for
   hypotension include relative adrenal insufficiency especially in
   setting of known malignancy with new adrenal lesion on CT. Cardiogenic
   shock unlikely given unchanged ECG, negative CEs and no evidence of CHF
   on CXR or exam.  PE also unlikely in as not hypoxic on exam, not
   tachycardic.
   --send C.diff samples
   --continue empiric coverage for severe c. diff with PO vancomycin and
   IV flagyl
   --close monitoring for development of toxic megacolon
   --broad coverage for severe sepsis with vancomycin IV and zosyn
   --UA negative, f/u cultures
   --ascites fluid negative for SBP, follow up gram stain and cultures
   --follow up blood cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and refractory ascites. He has a history of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient presented to the emergency department with confusion, hypotension, hypothermia, and an evolving leg hematoma. He was diagnosed with septic shock and severe c. diff infection. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/60 mmHg to 125/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and confused with poor attention and short-term memory.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and elevated platelet count. Liver function tests indicate elevated bilirubin levels and abnormal coagulation profile. Blood cultures have been negative to date.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock with possible sources including c. diff infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infection (UTI), or relative adrenal insufficiency. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to severe pancreatitis. He was previously weaned off of Levophed and is now back on lactulose due to confusion. The patient experienced multiple bowel movements (BMs) after being restarted on lactulose. There is also an evolving leg hematoma at the site of a recent fall, but his hematocrit (Hct) remains stable. The patient lost his arterial line (a-line).

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin at 04:00 AM on 08-10-2201, piperacillin at 05:12 AM on 08-10-2201, and metronidazole at 06:56 AM on 08-10-2201.

The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 0.05 mcg/kg/min. He is also on pantoprazole (Protonix) since 12:19 AM on 08-10-2201.

There are no changes to the patient's medical or family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of 24-hour events including weaning off Levophed, multiple bowel movements, and allergies to no known drugs. The patient received doses of vancomycin, piperacillin, and metronidazole on 2201-8-10 at 04:00 AM, 05:12 AM, and 06:56 AM respectively. The patient is currently on infusions of norepinephrine and pantoprazole. The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flow sheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows central venous pressure within normal range. Fluid balance indicates intake and output measurements. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with an ABG result of ///15/. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and lab results including complete blood count, blood gases, electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, and cardiac markers. Radiology images are also available.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's antibiotic therapy suggests a concern for infection. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results, particularly white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, can help identify any signs of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications. The summary of the information in the note is as follows:

- The patient has profound leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 93.6 K/uL, which is likely reactive but cannot exclude an underlying myeloproliferative disorder.
- The patient is weaning off Levophed, indicating improvement in hemodynamic stability.
- The patient has an increasing confusion and has been restarted on lactulose, suggesting possible hepatic encephalopathy.
- The patient has a large hematoma in the left leg and stable heme status.
- The patient is experiencing septic shock, most likely originating from the abdomen due to recent Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection. There is also a component of hypovolemic shock due to the right flank hematoma.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by shock or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with improving urine output.
- The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely related to fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is being followed by a liver team.
- The patient has been documented with DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) status.
- The patient has multiple lines, including an 18-gauge line and a presep catheter.

   risk for recurrent c. diff, leukocytosis c/w this.
   -- first two c. diff toxins negative, will repeat x 3, also will
   contact lab about sending cytotoxic assay as more sensitive.
   --Continue to cover for severe c. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanc (plan
   for 14 day course at completion of vanc/Zosyn treatment course)
   --Given that pt improved on current abx regimen, and was critically ill
   will continue empiric IV vanc and zosyn for planned 7 day course while
   continuing to look for source.
   -- Continue to follow up cultures.
   -- If WBC remains elevated in face of abx treatment, consider tagged
   WBC scan to determine occult etiology for infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He has refractory ascites and falls, hypotension, and hypothermia. The patient's current condition is consistent with infection/septic shock, with potential sources including peritoneal fluid, urine, pneumonia (PNA), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. There is no evidence of central nervous system infection. 

The patient has a history of C. diff infection in the past month, treated with oral vancomycin. He is at high risk for recurrent C. diff, and leukocytosis is consistent with this. The first two C. diff toxins were negative, but will repeat tests three times. A cytotoxic assay will also be conducted as it is more sensitive.

The patient's current antibiotics regimen includes intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. These antibiotics will be continued for a planned 7-day course while searching for the source of infection. Cultures will be followed up. If the white blood cell (WBC) count remains elevated despite antibiotic treatment, a tagged WBC scan will be considered to determine an occult etiology for infection.

The patient has a history of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis with known varices and cecal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs"

He has a history of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis and has undergone radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for HCC. The patient's recent complaint includes falls, hypotension, hypothermia, and an enlarging hematoma.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), a heart rate of 75 bpm, a blood pressure of 120/50 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's general appearance is described as awake and alert but mildly confused, with cachexia and an ill-appearing elderly man.

The physical examination reveals a neck with jugular venous distention to 12 cm, left internal jugular vein in place, pulmonary lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, cardiac rhythm regular with normal S1 and S2 sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops, abdomen distended with ascites, mildly tense, and mildly tender to palpation, and extremities without edema but with a large area of ecchymosis on the left thigh and flank.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis, who is currently in the ICU due to sepsis. The patient experienced shock, leukocytosis, and a large hematoma on his back after a fall. He remains off pressors, but has had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and choking/regurgitation during eating. The patient's mental status has also deteriorated, becoming more confused.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He received antibiotics including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin on 01/08/2201 at different times.

On the flow sheet, the patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/80 to 90/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). His weight is 69.8 kg, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 26 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,371 mL, output of 1,238 mL, and a urine output of 738 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis who presented with sepsis. He experienced shock, leukocytosis, and a large hematoma on his back after a fall. The patient remains off pressors, but has had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), choking, and regurgitation while eating. His confusion has increased. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), current temperature of 35.4°C (95.8°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/80 to 139/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is 69.8 kg. 

The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 26 mmHg, and fluid balance shows a total input of 1,371 mL and output of 1,238 mL, with a urine output of 738 mL. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin and anxious, with scattered crackles in his chest, a large and expanding ecchymosis over his left hip and leg, and soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, the patient follows simple commands. 

Lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 93"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU. He presented with sepsis, shock, leukocytosis, and a large hematoma following a fall. The patient remains off pressors, but has experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and choking/regurgitation during eating. He is also more confused today.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient has sepsis, indicating a systemic infection that may require further evaluation and treatment.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate fluctuations, which may suggest ongoing hemodynamic instability.
3. Respiratory issues: The presence of crackles in the lung fields and the need for respiratory support indicate possible pulmonary complications.
4. Confusion and altered mental status: The patient's increased confusion and regurgitation/choking episodes suggest potential neurological or cognitive complications.
5. Bleeding risk: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) indicate a higher risk of bleeding, especially considering the large hematoma already present.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's history of cirrhosis and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) suggest ongoing liver dysfunction, which can have various implications for the patient's overall health.

   PLAN:
   #Hypotension:
   Pt had hypotension not responsive to fluid rescusitation, at one point
   with 3-pressor requirement. Was hypothermic with rapidly elevating
   WBC.  Overall picture most likely consistent with infection/septic
   shock.  Potential sources include peritoneal fluid, urine, PNA, c.
   diff.  No evidence CNS infection by exam.  Peritoneal fluid negative
   for SBP, no 02 requirement, CXR clear. UA and Cx neg. Blood cx neg. Pt
   had recent c. diff infection in [**Month (only) 591**], was treated as outpatient with PO
   vanc, receipt of prescription confirmed with pharmacy.  Still at high

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and refractory ascites, along with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He has a recent history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient presented with significant lower abdominal pain overnight and is now experiencing hypotension, hypothermia, and an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. These symptoms suggest the possibility of infection or septic shock. 

The potential sources of infection include peritoneal fluid, urine, pneumonia (PNA), and C. diff. The patient's peritoneal fluid is negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and he does not require supplemental oxygen. His chest X-ray is clear, and urinalysis (UA) and culture (Cx) are negative. Blood culture is also negative. 

The patient had a previous C. diff infection treated with oral vancomycin (Vanc) as an outpatient. He remains at high risk for recurrent C. diff, and his leukocytosis is consistent with this. Although the three C. diff toxins are currently negative, the lab will be contacted about sending a cytotoxic assay, which is more sensitive. 

To cover for severe C. diff, the patient will continue to receive intravenous (IV) flagyl and oral vancomycin for a 14-day course at the completion of the current antibiotic treatment course. Empiric IV van"

   #Hypotension:
   Pt had hypotension not responsive to fluid rescusitation, at one point
   with 3-pressor requirement. Was hypothermic with rapidly elevating
   WBC.  Overall picture most likely consistent with infection/septic
   shock.  Potential sources include peritoneal fluid, urine, PNA, c.
   diff.  No evidence CNS infection by exam.  Peritoneal fluid negative
   for SBP, no 02 requirement, CXR clear. UA and Cx neg. Blood cx neg. Pt
   had recent c. diff infection in [**Month (only) 591**], was treated as outpatient with PO
   vanc, receipt of prescription confirmed with pharmacy.  Still at high
   risk for recurrent c. diff, leukocytosis c/w this.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Septic shock-Off pressors most likely source is abdominal given
   recent C. diff but we now have 3 neg C diff. we are sending off toxin
   and will keep on therapy for now. He has had neg blood urine and
   peritoneal fluid culture> Non con abd ct negative at admission.
   Hematoma could be superinfected but this would be a 2ndry process not
   the initial etiology of his sepsis. At this point we will complete
   7 days for zosyn/vanc and continue flagyl/po vanc and follow
   clinically.  Resend peritoneal fluid.  Add on ESR and CRP - ? osteo.
   Could consider tagged WBC scan
 but given his overall prognosis the
   likelihood of finding something upon which we could intervene may be
   low. Will discuss further with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**].
   2) Acute renal failure likely due to shock/ATN -improving urine
   output.
   3) Leukocytosis WBC 64 now trending down, likely reactive given
   increased LAP score and responding to antibiotics
   4) Flank hematoma Hgb stable, large ecchymosis on exam holding without
    transfusion
   5) Free Water deficit- calculate free water deficit and replete
 with
