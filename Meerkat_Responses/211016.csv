   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - GI input appreciated
   - ENT visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not
   surgical options
   - rad onc consulted, plan for XRT if no rebleeding
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed. Then call
   interventional neuroradiology for embolization
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until plan is finalized, then advance to
   clears as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who presented with large-volume hematemesis.
2. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed upon arrival to the MICU, showing evidence of blood in the upper airway but no active bleeding from the stomach.
3. A posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his large-volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
4. The patient has been on prednisone 20mg daily since [**2181-4-20**] for an unknown reason, which may contribute to leukocytosis.
5. The patient has hyponatremia, possibly due to dehydration, and will receive IV fluids overnight.
6. Tachycardia is resolving with IV fluids.
7. The patient has metastatic melanoma and is awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility for a clinical trial.
8. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) until further evaluation and will advance to clears as tolerated.
9. The patient has received blood products and will continue IV fluids.
10. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU for further monitoring and treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Rebleeding: The patient may experience another episode of bleeding, especially if the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient in the ICU has been experiencing fever spikes, with a current temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 83 to 123 beats per minute, blood pressure between 140/74 and 90/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a maximum temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius and a current temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the overnight anxiety episode. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received infusions and other medications in the ICU.

Flowsheet data indicates fluid balance, with a total input of 3,097 mL and output of 1,800 mL since midnight. The patient's blood products transfused amount to 1,075 mL, and their urine output is 1,800 mL.

Physical examination findings include sinus rhythm and peripheral pulses not assessed. Neurological examination was also not performed due to patient non-responsiveness.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count at 17.7 K/uL, hemoglobin levels ranging from 9.7 to 24.1 g/dL, platelet count of 368 K/uL, creatinine levels between 0.8 and 0.9 mg/dL, glucose levels around 91 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include anxiety, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and a history of melanoma. ICU care involves nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's fever, development of sepsis due to the elevated white blood cell count and fever spikes, further bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, complications related to the patient's history of melanoma, and possible infections or complications from the lines and devices in place."

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - appreciate GI input and EGD, will review final report
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - ENT consult for nasopharyngeal mass - ?active bleeding
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - 2 unit pRBC's now, 2 additional crossmatched
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears later after ENT eval
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - NS 1L @ 175cc/hr
   - recheck PM lytes
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently travelling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is
   awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear
   when the next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was
   advised given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until ENT eval, then advance to clears as
   tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU until documented to be hemodynamically stable x 24
   hours

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma. He presented to the ICU with large volume hematemesis. The source of the bleed is unclear, but an upper endoscopy (EGD) showed evidence of blood in the upper airway and a suspicious lesion for metastasis in the antrum of the stomach. However, it does not appear to be the source of the bleed at this time. The patient also has a marked progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head, which could explain his large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hematemesis - unclear if the source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal.
2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone for an unknown reason.
3. Hyponatremia - possibly due to dehydration and difficulty tolerating oral intake.
4. Tachycardia - resolving with IV fluids.
5. Metastatic melanoma - awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility for a clinical trial.
6. Nasopharyngeal mass - concern for posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma.

The patient is currently receiving supportive care, including IV fluids, pantoprazole (ppi) for gastritis, and monitoring for any potential complications. He is also scheduled for an ENT consultation for the nasopharyngeal mass"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis. GI input appreciated. ENT
   visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not surgical
   options. XRT started yesterday, plan for 10 treatments total. IR
   embolization yesterday without complication.
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed.
   - continue PPI (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor hct
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - ADAT
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Received 2L NS in ED, and 3 units pRBC's here, with
   continuation of IVF to maintain UOP. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr was also just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild
   prerenal azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia
 Possibly related to tumor, also following cultures as
   above. Appears to resolve some with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. advance diet as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges, plan to remove a-line prior to transfer to the
   [**Hospital Ward Name **].
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now, plan to transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for XRT

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume hematemesis. He has a history of prednisone use, which may contribute to leukocytosis. The patient has been struggling with nausea, vomiting, and difficulty tolerating oral intake for months, which could be related to hyponatremia. He also has tachycardia, possibly due to the tumor or dehydration. The patient is awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility for a clinical trial. He has received radiation therapy and embolization without complications. The plan is to continue PPI, maintain active type and screen, monitor HCT, and provide supportive care. Potential medical complications include nasopharyngeal bleed, gastrointestinal bleed, infection, and prerenal azotemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nasopharyngeal bleed: The patient has a large volume epistaxis and hematemesis, and there are two nasopharyngeal masses visualized. This could indicate a posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of melanoma, who was admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received radiation therapy and underwent interventional radiology (IR) embolization of bilateral sphenopalatine branches of the maxillary artery. The patient's serial hematocrit (HCT) has been stable. However, the patient's urine output (UOP) remains low at 453 mL, despite bolusing with 1.5 liters of fluid without improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating a possible infection. This could be due to a hospital-acquired infection or an underlying condition.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently receiving prophylactic stress ulcer precautions. It is important to monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic stability.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels suggest anemia. This could be a result of chronic disease, blood loss from the gastrointestinal bleeding, or other factors.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential renal insufficiency.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating possible diabetes or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of melanoma, currently admitted to the ICU for radiation therapy. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by melena and a high output of urine. The patient's vital signs indicate fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is receiving lorazepam and hydromorphone for anxiety and pain management, respectively.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's fever and hypotension could be indicative of an infection leading to septic shock.
2. Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage: The presence of melena suggests ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The high urine output and abnormal kidney function tests may indicate acute kidney injury, potentially due to volume overload or hypotension.
4. Malignancy-related complications: Given the patient's history of melanoma, there is a possibility of metastasis causing organ dysfunction or other complications.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism: Immobilization and malignancy increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
6. Delirium: The patient's tachycardia and altered mental status could be suggestive of del"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - GI input appreciated
   - ENT visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not
   surgical options
   - rad onc consulted, plan for XRT if no rebleeding
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed. Then call
   interventional neuroradiology for embolization
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until plan is finalized, then advance to
   clears as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots

   10. Dispo - ICU for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume hematemesis. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) showed evidence of blood in the upper airway, but did not identify the source of the bleed. However, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the antrum of the stomach. The patient also has a nasopharyngeal bleed, which could explain his large volume epistaxis and hematemesis. The nasopharyngeal masses were visualized by ENT and are not surgical options at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. The patient's large volume hematemesis could lead to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock if not managed promptly.
2. Nasopharyngeal bleed - the marked progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head raises concern for a posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma, which could result in severe bleeding and airway compromise.
3. Leukocytosis - the patient has recently started on prednisone for an unknown reason. Leukocytosis can increase the risk of infection, so monitoring for signs of infection is essential.
4. Hyponatremia - the patient has been struggling with nausea, vomiting, and difficulty tolerating PO for months. This could be due to dehydration, and"
