   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), renal insufficiency, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's course is complicated by recent weight loss, which is concerning and may indicate pre-renal/acute tubular necrosis (ATN) renal failure, shock liver, and cardiac strain.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding needs to be further evaluated to determine the cause, which could be ischemic colitis, diverticulitis, or a mass. Appropriate management includes continued monitoring of hemoglobin and fluid balance, aiming for a hematocrit (Hct) level greater than 30%. Colonoscopy may be performed once the patient is hemodynamically stable.

2. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's troponin levels are rising, indicating a possible ongoing myocardial infarction. Considering the patient's critical condition and the risk of active bleeding, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may not be feasible. It is important to continue monitoring cardiac biomarkers and consult cardiology for further assessment and treatment options.

3. Acute-on-chronic renal failure (AoCRF): The patient's hypovolem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic extremity ulcer, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), myocardial infarction (MI), renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's cardiac enzymes increased from CK 500 to 800s, trop up to 1.88, indicating ongoing cardiac injury. A transthoracic echo and ultrasound were performed. The patient was given ASA 325 and simvastatin 80, as recommended by the cardiology consult. Two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) were transfused to maintain hemoglobin concentration above 30. A PICC line was placed for access. The patient's lactate level decreased from 2.1 to 1.2. Mild hematuria was observed overnight. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for mild bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 134/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with fair dentition and a quarter-sized ulcer over the right heel. Neurologic examination is deferred. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic extremity ulcer: The presence of a chronic ulcer increases the risk of infection, non-healing"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, atrial fibrillation ( on
   home ASA), and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute onset BRBPR x 24
   hours with new NSTEMI and ARF in setting of hypovolemia and severe
   anemia.
   .
   #GI Bleeding: Given negative NG lavage  unlikely UGI source. He denies
   any abdominal pains. Rectal exam with gross BRBPR and positive guaiac
   noted. Most likely diverticular bleeding vs. AVM. Given history of
   20-lb. weight loss, colon cancer is also in the differential. Ischemic
   bowel less likely given recent lactate levels and his lack of abdominal
   pains.
   .
   - trending HCTs q6 hours
   - giving additional 2 Units blood overnight( got 1 Unit at OSH), goal
   HCT >30 given NSTEMI
   - holding anti-HTN medications
   - 2x 18g PIVs in place
   - IV PPI q 12 hours
   - follow-up GI consult recs, will likely be getting colonoscopy in [**12-8**]
   days once more stable
   .
   #NSTEMI: Patient has risk factors of HTN and hyperlipidemia but denies
   any prior MIs. He has severe anemia in setting of GI losses and poor PO
   intake with hypovolemia. Mild ST depressions on OSH EKG but improved on
   EKG here. Limited with medical management due to GIB and low blood
   pressures.  No c/o chest pains, SOB or subjective palpitations.
   - 1 x dose ASA
   - trending q8 hr cardiac enzymes
   - monitor telemetry
   - holding BB, no current anticoagulation due to recent low BP and GIB
   - repeat EKG
   - f/up TTE for evaluation of EF% and hypokinesis given recent elevated
   cardiac enzymes
   -pending TTE; consider cards consult given question of underlying
   cardiogenic shock
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Still in atrial fibrillation on EKG and
   telemetry, rates in the 70-90s now. Patient states he was diagnosed
   with atrial fibrillation about 4-5 months ago. He was on Coumadin for
   few weeks but had hematuria so switched to ASA daily.
   .
   -continue telemetry monitoring, HR 70-90 now
   -holding beta blocker for now given hypotension and GIB
   - resuscitate with IVFs and PRBCs
   - check TSH
   .
   #ARF: Likely due to hypovolemia and presumed pre-renal. However,
   patient poor historian and endorses taking a lot of daily NSAIDs ( 4- 6
   ibuprofen tablets daily) over past 3-4 weeks. Urine output is
   suboptimal now despite IVFs.
   - trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/up PCP records for Cr baseline
   - consider renal ultrsound if UOP still <30cc/hr
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   - f/up urine lytes, urine eosinophils
   - continue IVFs overnight
   - given poor UOP will continue with renal US  /  bladder scan
   .
   # Elevated Anion Gap: Most likely secondary to uremia/ARF and
   hypoperfusion in setting of recent GI losses. Also, need to consider
   lactate in setting of recent cardiac event and overall hypoperfusion to
   gut and end organs.
   -continue to trend lactate
   -STAT repeat electrolytes to recheck A-Gap, will trend overnight
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Most likely secondary to ARF, improving now from 6 to
   low 5 range. No new EKG peaked T waves on EKG so will hold off on Ca
   gluconate and additional insulin for now.
   - continue to trend
   - consider renal consult in a.m.
   .
   #HTN: Currently normotensive with BPs 120/60s range.
   - will hold anti-HTN meds due to hypotension and GIB
   - add back nifedipine and nadolol home dose once more stable
   #Transaminitis: AST and ALT rising from OSH today. Likely from
   hypoperfusion but also concern for NSAIDs being Tylenol as well as
   patient is poor historian. ALP is WNL and total bilirubin normal.
   - trend LFTs
   - check acetominophen levels; consider acetylcysteine dosing
   .
   #Right heel ulcer:
   - clean dry guauze dressings
   - wound care consult in place
   - cushioned boot for comfort
   .
   #BPH : continue home Flomax

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with acute onset of blood-tinged stool per rectum (BRBPR) for 24 hours, new NSTEMI, and acute renal failure in the setting of hypovolemia and severe anemia.

The patient's medical conditions include:
1. Extreme ulcer, chronic (including gangrene)
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS, unstable angina, coronary ischemia)
3. Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
5. Gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB)

Assessment and plan:
1. GI Bleeding: Negative NG lavage suggests that the source is not from the upper gastrointestinal tract. The patient denies any abdominal pain, and the rectal exam shows gross BRBPR and positive guaiac. The most likely cause is diverticular bleeding or arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Colon cancer is also in the differential. Ischemic bowel is less likely given recent lactate levels and the absence of abdominal pain.

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
   seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There
   is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
   akinesis of the basal inferior wall, distal half of the septum and
   lateral and distal anterior wall. There is apical dyskinesis. The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are
   seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
   apical half of the free wall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
   sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-8**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with extensive
   regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Increased PCWP.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, atrial fibrillation ( on
   home ASA), and hyperlipidemia who presents with GIB with NSTEMI and ARF
   in setting of hypovolemia and severe anemia.
   .
   #GI Bleeding: Still required 2 units pRBCs over course of yesterday.
   Ddx includes ischemic colitis with ischemic disease vs malignancy in
   lower GI tract. Liver service got increased ETOH history prompting
   possible EGD, however with neg NG lavage and sxs, still more suspicion
   for lower GI source.
   - GI following, appreciate recs- await endoscopy
   - trending HCTs q12h, keeping goal HCT >30 given NSTEMI
   - holding anti-HTN medications
   - 2x 18g PIVs in place
   - IV PPI q 12 hours
   .
   #NSTEMI: Patient had no documented history of CAD, but TTE yesterday
   confirming likely ischemic disease with EF 30-35 and extensive regional
   dysfunction leading to demand ischemia in setting of bleed/anemia. CK
   peaked in 800s, now trending downwards.
   - cardiology following, appreciate recs
   - continue ASA 325 (ok with GI)
   - restart metoprolol later today
   - monitor fluid status, goal even to -500cc negative
   - monitor telemetry
   - holding BB, no current anticoagulation due to recent low BP and GIB
   however CHADs2 is 3, so should discuss risks/benefits of coumadin after
   stable
   - repeat EKG
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Still in atrial fibrillation on EKG and
   telemetry, rates in the 70-90s now. Patient states he was diagnosed
   with atrial fibrillation about 4-5 months ago. He was on Coumadin for
   few weeks but had hematuria so switched to ASA daily.
   - hold coumadin, continue ASA
   - continue telemetry monitoring, HR 70-90 now
   - plan to restart metoprolol as before
   .
   #ARF: Cr still not improving, 2.8 this AM. Una not low, may be
   component of ATN. Unclear baseline. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis. Hyperkalemia improved
   - trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/up PCP records for Cr baseline
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   .
   #HTN: Currently normotensive with BPs 120/60s range.
   - may need beta blocker, ACEi for new CAD once more stable
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely [**1-8**] shock liver
   - trending downwards
   .
   #Right heel ulcer:
   - clean dry guauze dressings
   - wound care consult in place
   - cushioned boot for comfort

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute renal failure (ARF) in the setting of hypovolemia and severe anemia.

The patient required 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) over the course of yesterday. The differential diagnosis includes ischemic colitis with ischemic disease versus malignancy in the lower GI tract. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was planned, but it has not been performed yet due to the patient's unstable condition.

In terms of cardiac status, the patient had no documented history of coronary artery disease (CAD), but a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) confirmed likely ischemic disease with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35% and extensive regional dysfunction leading to demand ischemia in the setting of bleed/anemia. The cardiac enzymes peaked in the 800s and are now trending downwards.

The cardiology team recommended continuing aspirin 325 mg (which is safe with GI bleeding), restarting metoprolol later today, monitoring fluid status with a goal of even to -500cc negative, monitoring telemetry, holding beta-blockers (BBs), no current anticoagulation due to recent low blood pressure and"

   seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
   apical half of the free wall. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
   sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-8**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 142/87 to 151/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been diagnosed with hemorrhagic anemia attributed to the GIB. Serial hemoglobin (Hct) levels will be monitored, and transfusion will be provided if the Hct level drops below 30. The patient is currently receiving IV pantoprazole (Protonix) every 12 hours for gastrointestinal protection.

The patient also has acute renal failure, which is non-oliguric and possibly related to a pre-renal insult due to acute GI bleed. Monitoring of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine electrolytes, urine output, and comparison with prior creatinine determinations is recommended. The patient is currently receiving cardiac medications including aspirin, simvastatin, and will attempt to add on a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor if tolerated.

Given the patient's age and medical history, there are potential complications that can arise, including worsening anemia, persistent gastrointestinal bleeding,"

   .
   #GI Bleeding: Now appears to be resolving and stable HCT in low 30s
   range (31-33) after 5 Units PRBCs.  Ddx includes diverticulitis, AVM,
   and ischemic colitis vs malignancy in lower GI tract. Patient endorsed
   some increased ETOH history prompting possible EGD to be done in near
   future alongside colonoscopy.  Negative NG lavage and symptoms still
   favor this as an acute LGI process vs. UGI.
   - GI following, appreciate recs- await endoscopy once stable

   #NSTEMI: Known history of HTN and hyperlipidemia but no previous MIs or
   confirmed CAD. TTE consistent with multivessel ischemic disease with EF
   30-35% and extensive regional dysfunction. Patient likely had NSTEMI
   [**1-8**] demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed with acute anemia. CK peaked
   in 800s, now trending downwards.  No current SOB,CP or palpitations.

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Still in atrial fibrillation on EKG and
   telemetry, rates in the 70-90s now. Patient states he was diagnosed
   with atrial fibrillation about 4-5 months ago. He was on Coumadin for
   few weeks but had hematuria so switched to ASA daily.
   - holding  coumadin, continue ASA
   - continue telemetry monitoring, HR 70-90 now
   - slowly uptitrate metoprolol as tolerates .
   #ARF: Cr still near same 2.5-2.6 range and very slow to improve.  Given
   that urine sodium is not particularly low he likely has a component of
   ATN. Unclear baseline. Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is now hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit (HCT) in the low 30s range. The differential diagnosis for the LGIB includes diverticulitis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), ischemic colitis, and malignancy. The patient has been started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and will undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy in the near future. 

The patient's NSTEMI is likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of acute anemia. The echocardiogram (TTE) showed multivessel ischemic disease with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35% and extensive regional dysfunction. The patient is currently on low-dose aspirin (ASA), metoprolol, and high-dose statin therapy. 

The patient remains in atrial fibrillation with rates in the 70-90s range. He was previously on Coumadin but switched to ASA due to hematuria. The cardiac monitoring will continue, and metop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of NSTEMI and LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleeding). He has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently stable with controlled vital signs, but has several ongoing medical issues that require attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient still requires blood transfusions due to ongoing bleeding. The differential diagnosis includes ischemic colitis and malignancy in the lower GI tract. Further evaluation with endoscopy is pending.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's recent TTE confirmed extensive regional dysfunction leading to demand ischemia in the setting of bleed/anemia. His CK levels peaked in the 800s and are now trending downwards. Cardiology follow-up is planned.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation with rates in the 70-90s. He was previously on Coumadin, but switched to ASA due to hematuria. Coumadin is currently held, and metoprolol will be restarted later today.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels remain elevated at 2.8. The cause of ARF may be related to hypovolemia or acute tubular necrosis. Renal ultrasound did not reveal any signs of hydronephrosis. Ongoing monitoring and avoidance of nephrotoxins"

   Assessment and Plan:
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, atrial fibrillation ( on
   home ASA), and hyperlipidemia who presents with GIB with NSTEMI and ARF
   in setting of hypovolemia and severe anemia.
   .
   #GI Bleeding: Still required 2 units pRBCs over course of yesterday.
   Ddx includes ischemic colitis with ischemic disease vs malignancy in
   lower GI tract. Liver service got increased ETOH history prompting
   possible EGD, however with neg NG lavage and sxs, still more suspicion
   for lower GI source.
   - GI following, appreciate recs- await endoscopy
   - trending HCTs q12h, keeping goal HCT >30 given NSTEMI
   - holding anti-HTN medications
   - 2x 18g PIVs in place
   - IV PPI q 12 hours
   .
   #NSTEMI: Patient had no documented history of CAD, but TTE yesterday
   confirming likely ischemic disease with EF 30-35 and extensive regional
   dysfunction leading to demand ischemia in setting of bleed/anemia. CK
   peaked in 800s, now trending downwards.
   - cardiology following, appreciate recs
   - continue ASA 325 (ok with GI)
   - restart metoprolol later today
   - monitor fluid status, goal even to -500cc negative
   - monitor telemetry
   - holding BB, no current anticoagulation due to recent low BP and GIB
   however CHADs2 is 3, so should discuss risks/benefits of coumadin after
   stable
   - repeat EKG
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Still in atrial fibrillation on EKG and
   telemetry, rates in the 70-90s now. Patient states he was diagnosed
   with atrial fibrillation about 4-5 months ago. He was on Coumadin for
   few weeks but had hematuria so switched to ASA daily.
   - hold coumadin, continue ASA
   - continue telemetry monitoring, HR 70-90 now
   - plan to restart metoprolol as before
   .
   #ARF: Cr still not improving, 2.8 this AM. Una not low, may be
   component of ATN. Unclear baseline. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis. Hyperkalemia improved
   - trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/up PCP records for Cr baseline
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   .
   #HTN: Currently normotensive with BPs 120/60s range.
   - may need beta blocker, ACEi for new CAD once more stable
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely [**1-8**] shock liver
   - trending downwards
   .
   #Right heel ulcer:
   - clean dry guauze dressings
   - wound care consult in place
   - cushioned boot for comfort
   .
   #BPH :
   - holding flomax for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient required 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to severe anemia. The differential diagnosis for GIB includes ischemic colitis and malignancy in the lower GI tract. 

The patient also presented with acute kidney injury (ARF), which is not improving. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus rhythm, and was on aspirin (ASA) but had hematuria, so switched to warfarin (Coumadin). 

The patient's vital signs are stable with blood pressure ranging from 120/60s, heart rate in the 70-90s, respiratory rate at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. 

Physical examination reveals pale complexion, clear lung sounds, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, normoactive bowel sounds, and warm extremities with 1+ right lower extremity (LE) pulse and 2+ left LE pulse. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated troponin T levels, mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels. Other lab values, such as electrolytes and liver"

   Assessment and Plan:
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, atrial fibrillation ( on
   home ASA), and hyperlipidemia who presented with LGIB,   NSTEMI and ARF
   in setting of hypovolemia  & severe anemia with HCT drop to 21 range.
   .
   #GI Bleeding: Now appears to be resolving and stable HCT in low 30s
   range (31-33) after 5 Units PRBCs.  Ddx includes diverticulitis, AVM,
   and ischemic colitis vs malignancy in lower GI tract. Patient endorsed
   some increased ETOH history prompting possible EGD to be done in near
   future alongside colonoscopy.  Negative NG lavage and symptoms still
   favor this as an acute LGI process vs. UGI.
   .
   - GI following, appreciate recs- await endoscopy once stable
   - trending HCTs q12h, keeping goal HCT >30 given NSTEMI
   - on low dose BB now as blood pressures have recovered, will monitor BP
   closely
   - 2x 18g PIVs in place & PICC line
   - switched PPI from IV to PO q 12 hours
   -ADAT, now tolerating clears well
   .
   #NSTEMI: Known history of HTN and hyperlipidemia but no previous MIs or
   confirmed CAD. TTE consistent with multivessel ischemic disease with EF
   30-35% and extensive regional dysfunction. Patient likely had NSTEMI
   [**1-8**] severe demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed with acute anemia. CK
   peaked in 800s, now trending downwards.  No current SOB,CP or
   palpitations.
   - continue trend CKs/trops
   - cardiology following, appreciate recs
   - continue ASA 325 (ok with GI), low dose metoprolol, high dose statin
   - monitor fluid status, goal I/O even to -500cc negative
   - cont monitor telemetry
   - repeat EKG
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Still in atrial fibrillation on EKG and
   telemetry, rates in the 70-90s now. Patient states he was diagnosed
   with atrial fibrillation about 4-5 months ago. He was on Coumadin for
   few weeks but had hematuria so switched to ASA daily.
   - holding  coumadin, continue ASA
   - continue telemetry monitoring, HR 70-90 now
   - slowly uptitrate metoprolol as tolerates .
   #ARF: Cr still near same 2.5-2.6 range and very slow to improve.  Given
   that urine sodium is not particularly low he likely has a component of
   ATN. Unclear baseline. Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis.
   Hyperkalemia improving which is reassuring. Also much better UOP now.
   - continue to trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/up PCP records for Cr baseline
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   .
   #HTN: Currently normotensive with BPs 120-140s/60s-70s range.
   - uptitrate beta blocker
   - one ARF resovles can add  ACEi  at later date for new CAD
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely [**1-8**] shock liver
   - trending downwards, continue to monitor labs for improvement
   .
   #Right heel ulcer:
   - clean dry guauze dressings
   - wound care consult in place
   - cushioned boot for comfort
   .
   #BPH :
   - holding flomax for now given recent low BPs

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 134/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 80 bpm. He is on mechanical ventilation and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient initially presented with LGIB, which appears to be resolving. However, there is a possibility of rebleeding or complications such as diverticulitis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), ischemic colitis, or malignancy in the lower GI tract.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and presented with NSTEMI. He has multivessel ischemic disease, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%. There is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or cardiac complications.

3. ARF: The patient developed ARF, likely secondary to hypovolemia and severe anemia. His creatinine levels are elevated, and he has some component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is crucial to monitor renal function and avoid nephrotoxins.

   Assessment and Plan:
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with PMH significant for HTN, atrial fibrillation ( on
   home ASA), and hyperlipidemia who presented with LGIB,   NSTEMI and ARF
   in setting of hypovolemia  & severe anemia with HCT drop to 21 range.
   .
   #GI Bleeding: Now appears to be resolving and stable HCT in low 30s
   range (31-33) after 5 Units PRBCs.  Ddx includes diverticulitis, AVM,
   and ischemic colitis vs malignancy in lower GI tract. Patient endorsed
   some increased ETOH history prompting possible EGD to be done in near
   future alongside colonoscopy.  Negative NG lavage and symptoms still
   favor this as an acute LGI process vs. UGI.
   - GI following, appreciate recs- await endoscopy once stable
   - trending HCTs q12h, keeping goal HCT >30 given NSTEMI
   - on low dose BB now as blood pressures have recovered, will monitor BP
   closely
   - 2x 18g PIVs in place & PICC line
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   -ADAT, now tolerating clears well
   .
   #NSTEMI: Known history of HTN and hyperlipidemia but no previous MIs or
   confirmed CAD. TTE consistent with multivessel ischemic disease with EF
   30-35% and extensive regional dysfunction. Patient likely had NSTEMI
   [**1-8**] demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed with acute anemia. CK peaked
   in 800s, now trending downwards.  No current SOB,CP or palpitations.
   - cardiology following, appreciate recs
   - continue ASA 325mg  (ok with GI), low dose metoprolol, high dose
   statin
   - start low dose captopril with close f/u of lytes, BP
   - cont monitor telemetry
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Still in atrial fibrillation on EKG and
   telemetry, rates in the 70-90s now. Patient states he was diagnosed
   with atrial fibrillation about 4-5 months ago. He was on Coumadin for
   few weeks but had hematuria so switched to ASA daily.
   - holding  coumadin, continue ASA
   - continue telemetry monitoring, HR 70-90 now
   - slowly uptitrate metoprolol as tolerates .
   #ARF: Cr still near same 2.5-2.6 range and very slow to improve.  Given
   that urine sodium is not particularly low he likely has a component of
   ATN. Unclear baseline. Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis.
   Hyperkalemia improving which is reassuring. Also much better UOP now.
   - continue to trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/up PCP records for Cr baseline
   - monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hr
   .
   #HTN: Currently normotensive with BPs 120-140s/60s-70s range.
   - continue metoprolol, hold on further titration at this time
   - adding low dose ACEI
   .
   #Transaminitis: Likely [**1-8**] shock liver
   - trending downwards, continue to monitor labs for improvement
   .
   #Right heel ulcer:
   - clean dry guauze dressings
   - wound care consult in place
   - cushioned boot for comfort
   .
   #BPH :
   - holding flomax for now given recent low BPs

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently normotensive with a blood pressure in the 120-140s/60s-70s range. His heart rhythm is still in atrial fibrillation, but his rates have decreased to 70-90 beats per minute. The patient's creatinine levels are near the same range of 2.5-2.6 and are slow to improve. There is a possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given the urine sodium levels. The patient's kidney function is improving, as indicated by an increasing urine output. His liver enzymes are also trending downwards, suggesting improvement. The patient has a right heel ulcer that requires wound care management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's slow improvement in creatinine levels and the presence of hyperkalemia suggest the possibility of ATN. Close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of nephrotoxins are necessary.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation, which can lead to potential complications such as stroke or heart failure. Monitoring of heart rate and consideration"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o man with likely multivessel CAD (based on TTE) and GIB. Hct now
   stable, medical management for now. Would to continue to titrate up BB
   and consider adding
   low dose ACE today (short acting, IV agents with close monitoring of
   Cr, K). Not clear what his baseline Cr is. Continue ASA + statin.
   Apreciate GI input, likely endoscopy prior
   to discharge. Avoid NSAIDS. I agree with remainder of plan as outlined
   in resident note. Okay to transfer to floor today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of likely lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), who has been managed medically. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 35.7°C (96.3°F)
- Heart rate: 91 bpm (76-99 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 145/83 mmHg (98-149/49-94 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (17-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air
- Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,008 mL and a total output of 1,945 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 937 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery but not on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results include:
- Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 185 K/uL
- Blood glucose: 120 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
- Sodium: 21 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
- Calcium: 67 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 108 mEq/L
- Phosphate: 141 mEq/L
- Troponin T: 3.29 mcg/L
- Lactate: 1.1 mmol/L
- Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
- Lactate dehydrogenase: 540 IU/L

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has likely multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and GIB. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and medical management is being continued for now. The plan includes titrating up beta-blockers and considering adding a low-dose ACE inhibitor with close monitoring of creatinine and potassium levels. The patient is already on aspirin and a statin. It is also recommended to perform an endoscopy prior to discharge and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient is okay to be transferred to the floor today."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o man with likely multivessel CAD (based on TTE) and GIB.
   GIB
   -Hct now stable x 24hrs
   -GI following intend to scope before d/c (hopefully tomorrow)
   -consider adding low dose ACE today (short acting, IV agents with close
   monitoring of Cr, K).
   Renal insufficiency
   - Not clear what his baseline Cr is.
   NSTEMI
   -Continue ASA + statin
   -medical management for now
 likely related to anemia from bleed
   rather than plaque mediated
   -echo with WMA in multiple segmental regions making likely multi-vessel
   disease
   -Cardiology following
   I agree with remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Okay to transfer to floor today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of likely multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He was admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and GIB. The patient has been managed medically and is currently stable. His vital signs are within normal limits, although he is hypothermic with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F). The patient's blood pressure is 145/83 mmHg, heart rate is 91 bpm, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has received transfusions of blood products overnight. His review of systems is mostly unchanged from admission, except for hematuria. His flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid balance issues, with a negative balance of 937 mL since 89 AM. His respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, and he is not on mechanical ventilation. His physical examination reveals clear lungs, no murmurs on cardiac examination, and a soft abdomen with no guarding or rebound tenderness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as elevated troponin-T, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with unknown weight, admitted to the ICU due to multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of chronic extremity ulcer, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9 C (96.7 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/65 to 148/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on various medications including fentanyl and pantoprazole. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic examination. Laboratory results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, troponin-T, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and other lab values. The patient is receiving ICU care with appropriate nutrition, glycemic control, and monitoring of lines. The patient has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of lines and tubes, which can provide a potential entry point for pathogens. Additionally, the patient's immune system may be compromised due to renal failure and other underlying conditions.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, and their coagulation profile may be affected due to the use of anticoagulant medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]M with afib, HTN with BRBPR c/b NSTEMI and ARF readmitted to MICU
   yesterday for active bleeding with continued bleeding despite 2 angio
   procedures overnight.
   .
   * GI bleeding
   Suspect lower source given BRBPR, most likely a diverticular bleed per
   GI opinion. Also could be  AVM, or malignancy. No associated abdominal
   pain to suggest ischemia, though should be considered with afib. Less
   likely a brisk upper bleed eg due to PUD.
   Since coming to the MICU, BPs have dipped.
   - per d/w GI will proceed with angio given increased frequency of large
   bloody bowel movements this AM. will give acetylcysteine and bicarb
   prior to study
   - transfuse 2 units now, goal >30 given concern for cardiac ischemia
   - access PICC, PIV 18g
   - trend hct q4h
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
    -hold metoprolol for now
   - given renal insufficiency and possibility of platelet dysfunction
   will also give ddavp
   .
   * NSTEMI: Trop still lingering and elevated but all CKs flat for 3 days
   now. No c/o active CP.
   Patient with evidence of multivessel disease on TTE. Ruled in for
   NSTEMI by enzymes this admission with enzymes recently trending down.
   Attributed to demand ischemia in setting of bleeding.
   - HOLD aspirin for now given active bleeding
   - HOLD metoprolol
   - continue statin
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG
   - telemetry
   .
   * Atrial fibrillation
   Patient diagnosed [**3-10**] mo prior to admission. Not on warfarin as an
   outpt [**1-8**] hematuria. Given multiple bleeding episodes would be
   hesistant to restart on warfarin. CHADS2=3 (chf, htn, age)
   - may restart metoprolol if BP and bleeding stable later in the day
   .
   * CHF, systolic, chronic
   Likely due to underlying CAD. Likely intravascularly dry given
   bleeding, dizziness on standing.
   - holding metoprolol and captopril for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic systolic heart failure, and recent readmission to the MICU for active bleeding. The patient underwent two angiography procedures overnight but continued to experience bleeding. He has received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells and is being prepared for surgery. The patient has ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected to be from a diverticular bleed, as well as evidence of multivessel disease on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) indicating a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to a prerenal state or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is an anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure, and the patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, for which warfarin therapy has been withheld due to bleeding episodes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued or worsened gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially requiring additional surgical intervention.
2. Cardiac ischemia or further myocardial damage due to ongoing NSTEMI and underlying multivessel disease.
3. Progression of acute renal failure, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Development of infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged ICU stay.
5. Complications related to atrial fibrillation, such as thrombo"

   [**Age over 90 **]M with afib, HTN with BRBPR c/b NSTEMI and ARF readmitted to MICU
   yesterday for active bleeding with continued bleeding despite 2 angio
   procedures overnight.
   .
   * GI bleeding
   Suspect lower source given BRBPR - eg diverticular bleed, AVM, or
   malignancy. No associated abdominal pain to suggest ischemia, though
   should be considered with afib. Less likely a brisk upper bleed eg due
   to PUD.
   Since coming to the MICU, BPs have dipped.
   - per d/w GI will proceed with angio given increased frequency of large
   bloody bowel movements this AM. will give acetylcysteine and bicarb
   prior to study
   - transfuse 2 units now, goal >30 given concern for cardiac ischemia
   - access PICC, PIV 18g
   - trend hct q4h
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] for now though suspicion higher for a lower
   source of bleed
   - hold metoprolol for now
   - given renal insufficiency and possibility of platelet dysfunction
   will also give ddavp
   .
   * NSTEMI: Trop still lingering and elevated but all CKs flat for 3 days
   now. No c/o active CP.
   Patient with evidence of multivessel disease on TTE. Ruled in for
   NSTEMI by enzymes this admission with enzymes recently trending down.
   Attributed to demand ischemia in setting of bleeding.
   - HOLD aspirin for now given active bleeding
   - HOLD metoprolol
   - continue statin
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG
   - telemetry
   .
   * Atrial fibrillation
   Patient diagnosed [**3-10**] mo prior to admission. Not on warfarin as an
   outpt [**1-8**] hematuria. Given multiple bleeding episodes would be
   hesistant to restart on warfarin. CHADS2=3 (chf, htn, age)
   - may restart metoprolol if BP and bleeding stable later in the day
   .
   * CHF, systolic, chronic
   Likely due to underlying CAD. Likely intravascularly dry given
   bleeding, dizziness on standing.
   - holding metoprolol and captopril for now
   - follow i/o, weight
   .
   * Acute renal failure
   [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-8**] prerenal state given bleeding, NSAID use. Cr has been
   trending down this admission. Also consider ATN.
   - trend Cr, urine output
   - avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   - check PM lytes
   .
   * Anion gap
   Likely due to renal failure. Less likely, lactic acidosis.
   - recheck lactate
   - trend chemistries
   .
   * HTN
   - hold home antihypertensives for now given bleeding
   .
   * R heel ulcer
   - continue local care, does not appear infected

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic systolic heart failure, acute renal failure, and possible NSTEMI. He presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding and was admitted to the MICU. The patient underwent two angiographic procedures to identify and control the source of bleeding but was unsuccessful. He received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells, mucomyst, and sodium bicarb for renal protection with contrast load. 

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 91 bpm with an irregular rhythm, blood pressure of 108/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 33.2%, platelet count of 185 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 26 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, and troponin T levels ranging from 3.29 to 5.17 ng/mL. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes and cardiac enzymes.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI and ARF. He was readmitted to the MICU for active bleeding that did not localize during two angiographic procedures overnight. The patient has been experiencing bloody bowel movements, which suggests a lower GI bleed. 

The assessment and plan include:
- Proceeding with angiography to identify the source of the lower GI bleed.
- Transfusing 2 units of blood due to a low hemoglobin level and concern for cardiac ischemia.
- Accessing a PICC line and PIV 18g for vascular access.
- Trending hematocrit every four hours.
- Continuing IV proton pump inhibitor for now, though suspicion is higher for a lower source of bleed.
- Holding metoprolol for now.
- Giving desmopressin (DDAVP) due to renal insufficiency and possibility of platelet dysfunction.

For NSTEMI:
- Holding aspirin for now due to active bleeding.
- Holding metoprolol.
- Continuing statin.
- Trending cardiac enzymes.
- Repeating EKG.
- Placing on telemetry.

For atrial fibrillation:
- Restarting metoprolol if BP and bleeding stable later in the day.

For congestive heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic:
- Holding metoprolol and captopril for now.

   * GI bleeding
   Suspect lower source given BRBPR, most likely a diverticular bleed per
   GI opinion. Also could be  AVM, or malignancy. No associated abdominal
   pain to suggest ischemia, though should be considered with afib. Less
   likely a brisk upper bleed eg due to PUD. Since coming to the MICU, BPs
   have dipped and he is now s/p 10 Units blood x 24 hours
   - f/up final report from overnight IR Angio ( 2^nd procedure).--> may
   need general surgery & OR today
   - f/up additional GI recs, now holding off on colonoscopy in favor of
   IR/surgery instead given extent of LGI hemorrhage.
   - continue to  transfuse actively with PRBCs now, goal >30 given
   concern for cardiac ischemia
   - access PICC, CVL at RIJ, PIV 18g
   - trend hct q4h today
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]

   * Atrial fibrillation
   Patient diagnosed [**3-10**] mo prior to admission. Not on warfarin as an
   outpt [**1-8**] hematuria. Given multiple bleeding episodes would be
   hesistant to restart on warfarin. CHADS=3 (chf, htn, age)
   - need to hold ASA for very active GIB
   - holding metoprolol given low  BP and bleeding
   .
   * CHF, systolic, chronic
   Likely due to underlying CAD. Likely intravascularly dry given
   bleeding, dizziness on standing.
   - holding metoprolol and captopril for now
   - follow i/o, weights
   .
   * Acute renal failure
   [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-8**] prerenal state given bleeding, NSAID use. Cr has been very
   slowly trending down this admission. Also consider ATN.
   - trend Cr, urine output goal >30cc/hr
 especially in setting of
   hypovolemia and LGIB
   - avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   - check PM lytes
   .
   * Anion gap
   Likely due to renal failure. Less likely, lactic acidosis.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic systolic heart failure, and acute renal failure. He was admitted to the MICU yesterday for active bleeding and has continued to bleed despite two angiographic procedures overnight. The source of the bleeding is suspected to be lower gastrointestinal (GI), possibly due to diverticular bleeding, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or malignancy. There are no signs of abdominal pain suggesting ischemia, but it should be considered given the patient's atrial fibrillation. A colonoscopy has been deferred in favor of an interventional radiology (IR) procedure and possible general surgery intervention.

The patient received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) since transfer to MICU and was given mucomyst and sodium bicarb for renal protection with contrast load. Despite ongoing efforts, the patient continues to have episodes of bleeding with clots, averaging 250cc/episode, once an hour. He was taken back to the IR suite for a second angiogram overnight, which did not localize the bleeding. Surgery is aware of the situation and the patient is likely going to the operating room (OR) this morning. He was also given one unit of platelets prior.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]M with afib, HTN with BRBPR c/b NSTEMI and ARF readmitted to MICU
   yesterday for active bleeding with continued bleeding despite 2 angio
   procedures overnight.
   .
   * GI bleeding
   Suspect lower source given BRBPR, most likely a diverticular bleed per
   GI opinion. Also could be  AVM, or malignancy. No associated abdominal
   pain to suggest ischemia, though should be considered with afib. Less
   likely a brisk upper bleed eg due to PUD.
   Since coming to the MICU, BPs have dipped.
   - per d/w GI will proceed with angio given increased frequency of large
   bloody bowel movements this AM. will give acetylcysteine and bicarb
   prior to study
   - transfuse 2 units now, goal >30 given concern for cardiac ischemia
   - access PICC, PIV 18g
   - trend hct q4h
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
    -hold metoprolol for now
   - given renal insufficiency and possibility of platelet dysfunction
   will also give ddavp
   .
   * NSTEMI: Trop still lingering and elevated but all CKs flat for 3 days
   now. No c/o active CP.
   Patient with evidence of multivessel disease on TTE. Ruled in for
   NSTEMI by enzymes this admission with enzymes recently trending down.
   Attributed to demand ischemia in setting of bleeding.
   - HOLD aspirin for now given active bleeding
   - HOLD metoprolol
   - continue statin
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG
   - telemetry
   .
   * Atrial fibrillation
   Patient diagnosed [**3-10**] mo prior to admission. Not on warfarin as an
   outpt [**1-8**] hematuria. Given multiple bleeding episodes would be
   hesistant to restart on warfarin. CHADS2=3 (chf, htn, age)
   - may restart metoprolol if BP and bleeding stable later in the day
   .
   * CHF, systolic, chronic
   Likely due to underlying CAD. Likely intravascularly dry given
   bleeding, dizziness on standing.
   - holding metoprolol and captopril for now
   - follow i/o, weight
   .
   * Acute renal failure
   [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-8**] prerenal state given bleeding, NSAID use. Cr has been
   trending down this admission. Also consider ATN.
   - trend Cr, urine output
   - avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   - check PM lytes
   .
   * Anion gap
   Likely due to renal failure. Less likely, lactic acidosis.
   - recheck lactate
   - trend chemistries
   .
   * HTN
   - hold home antihypertensives for now given bleeding
   .
   * R heel ulcer
   - continue local care, does not appear infected

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a history of multivessel disease. The patient presented to the hospital with bradycardia, hypotension, and ran initially to the cardiac catheterization lab for an angiogram due to a suspected non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

During the procedure, the patient experienced active bleeding and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management. The patient received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and was given Mucomyst and sodium bicarb for renal protection. 

The patient's bleeding persisted, with ongoing bloody bowel movements (BRBPR), and despite two angiographic procedures overnight, the source of bleeding could not be localized. The patient is scheduled for surgery this morning and received one unit of platelets prior to the procedure. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.1°C (95.2°F), heart rate 91 bpm (normal range 72-98 bpm), blood pressure 108/65 mmHg (normal range 76/53-148/80 mmHg), respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute (normal range 13-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 92% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell"

    - continue to monitor SaO2 with transfusions, lasix if necessary
   2. CAD/NSTEMI: currently appears stable with no further ekg changes
    - trending enzymes, ekg
    - holding asa and bb while bleeding statin (while npo)
    - patient is at risk for intra-operative cardiac event, but if the
   decision is made tp proceed with surgery, in the abscence of current
   acs, benefits of surgery outweigh risk.  This algorithm may change if
   cardiac status detiorates

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He presented with bloody bowel movement and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient initially remained hemodynamically stable but later developed recurrent bloody bowel movements and required angiography. After the procedure, he showed signs of active bleeding and was taken back to angiography. The family was informed, and the patient is reluctant to undergo surgery. Currently, the patient is hemodynamically stable after receiving 10 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GIB): The patient has recurrent bleeding despite previous interventions, indicating a likely diverticular nature. Surgery is considered as the next management step, but the patient is unsure. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamics and vital signs will be necessary. Blood products may be required based on the patient's hematocrit levels.

2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's cardiac status appears stable at present. However, there is a risk for intra-operative cardiac events during surgery. Cardiac enzymes and EKG changes will be monitored, and statins will be continued while the patient is on non-parenteral nutrition.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient does not appear to be volume overloaded"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M CAD, PVD, here w GIB likely [**Female First Name (un) **] and splenic flexure
   1. GIB: recurrent bleed overnight after angio procedure, with no
   evidence of bleed when taken to suite.  Most likely diverticular in
   nature.  Although surgery is likely next management step, patient is
   unsure if he would like to go through with this. Once family in, he
   will likely consent  to surgery given massive transfusion need.
    - will continue to monitor hemodynamics
    - continue to t/f as necessay f/u q 2 hr hct, giving platelets and ffp
   with pRBCs
    - continue to monitor SaO2 with transfusions, lasix if necessary
   2. CAD/NSTEMI: currently appears stable with no further ekg changes
    - trending enzymes, ekg
    - holding asa and bb while bleeding statin (while npo)
    - patient is at risk for intra-operative cardiac event, but if the
   decision is made tp proceed with surgery, in the abscence of current
   acs, benefits of surgery outweigh risk.  This algorithm may change if
   cardiac status detiorates
   3. CHF:
    - currently does not appear volume overloaded, continue to monitor
   volume status and would give lasix if any effect on oxygenation/wob
   4. AoCRF: s/p 2 angio dye loads, but creatinine remains stable
    - cont follow
    - getting mucomyst and bicarb
   5. Goals of care:
    - patients family coming in to ICU today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and bradycardia. He initially remained hemodynamically stable but developed recurrent GIB after an angiography procedure. The source of the bleeding is likely diverticular in nature. The patient's family has been informed and he is unsure about undergoing surgery. However, given the massive transfusion needed, it is likely that he will consent to surgery once the family is present.

The patient's condition includes acute coronary syndrome (ACS), congestive heart failure (CHF), and acute on chronic renal failure (AoCRF). He has received multiple doses of contrast for angiography, but his creatinine levels remain stable. The patient's goals of care are to be discussed with his family as they arrive in the ICU today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has experienced recurrent bleeding despite an angiography procedure. If surgery is not performed or if there are complications during the procedure, the bleeding may continue or worsen, leading to further instability and potential shock.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's cardiac status needs close monitoring as he is at risk for intra-operative cardiac events during any surgical intervention. If his cardiac condition deteriorates, it"
