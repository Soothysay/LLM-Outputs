   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with history of HTN, HL, multiple falls who presented
   with lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive and s/p troponin
   leak.
   .
   # Type II MI/ Demand Ischemia:
   Known troponin leak to 9 at OSH, trending down. EKG with ST depressions
   laterally unclear if related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed
   ischemia. Likely large contribution of anemia, presumably new given
   recent GI blood loss. Currently asymptomatic.  Has been on heparin gtt
   overnight.
   - DC heparin gtt
   - continue ASA, Plavix, statin
   - transfuse RBCs to Hct upper 20s.
   - will not likely pursue a cath
   - BB and ACE for BP control
   .
   # Anemia:
   Known to be guaiac positive, although per pt's history, had had
   aggressive bleed several days ago and nothing gross since then. Likely
   lower GI bleed from known internal hemorrhoids.  Elevated BUN suggests
   upper GI source vs contraction.   Hct from this AM drawn prior to
   completion of transfusion, not accurate post-transfusion Hct.
   - GI will do upper and lower endoscopy on Monday
   - f/u iron panel
   - f/u post transfusion Hct today
   - maintain good IV access
   - type and cross, transfuse to Hct 25 given suspicion of active
   ischemia
   - IV Famotidine
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: improving.  Afebrile but negative UA and CXR.
   - will continue to monitor.
   .
   #  Hypertension:
   Started on labetalol last night to help w blood pressure control and
   nitro drip being weaned off.  Found home medications from pharmacy.
   - wean off nitro drip and start home Imdur
   - switch home verapamil to carvedilol
   - start home hctz, lisinopril.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart failure who presented with lightheadedness. He was found to be anemic, hypertensive, and had a troponin leak. The patient has been on heparin overnight and is currently asymptomatic. He has received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Type II MI/Demand Ischemia: The patient has a known troponin leak, which suggests myocardial injury. This could be due to a type II myocardial infarction or demand ischemia, possibly caused by anemia resulting from recent gastrointestinal blood loss. The patient's ongoing management includes discontinuing heparin, continuing aspirin, Plavix, and statin therapy, transfusing RBCs to achieve a hematocrit level above 20%, and considering a cardiac catheterization.

2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely caused by a lower gastrointestinal bleed from known internal hemorrhoids. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is less likely due to the absence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Further evaluation with an upper and lower endoscopy is planned. The patient's post-transfusion hematocrit should be monitored, and good IV access should be maintained.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving. However, he remains afebrile, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) and heart failure (HL), presenting with lightheadedness.
- He was found to be anemic, hypertensive, and had an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but trending down.
- His EKG shows ST depressions laterally, unclear if related to hypertrophy or ischemia.
- He received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and is on heparin, aspirin (ASA), Plavix, and a statin.
- The plan is to transfuse more RBCs to achieve a hematocrit (Hct) level in the upper 20s.
- A cardiac catheterization is planned for Monday.
- Blood pressure control will be managed with beta-blockers (BB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE).
- The patient has anemia, likely due to lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from known hemorrhoids.
- Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) suggests a possible upper GI source.
- GI services are aware of the situation and will see the patient in the morning.
- Further investigations include obtaining medical records from the previous hospitalization, conducting an anemia panel specifically for iron levels, performing serial hemoglobin tests every 8-12 hours based on the amount of bleeding, maintaining good intravenous (IV) access, and cross-matching blood.
- The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will have tube feeding initiated in the morning.
- IV Famotidine has been administered.
- The patient also has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a stress reaction.
- Hypertension is currently uncontrolled, and the patient does not remember his medications.
- The patient is on a nitroglycerin drip and will be started on oral medications for blood pressure control, with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150s.
- Consideration will be given to adding hydralazine.
- The patient's care will be continued in the ICU, and he will be on cardiac diet, NPO after midnight, receiving liquids as needed, and IV fluids as needed.
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with heparin.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The patient's disposition will remain in the CCU (Cardiac Care Unit) for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reinfarction: The patient's ongoing ischemia and elevated troponin levels suggest a high risk of reinfarction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite the nitroglycerin drip, putting him at risk of hypotension.
3. Bleeding: The patient's an"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with history of HTN, HL, multiple falls who presented
   with lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive and s/p troponin
   leak.
   .
   # Type II MI/ Demand Ischemia:
   Known troponin leak to 9 at OSH, trending down. EKG with ST depressions
   laterally unclear if related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed
   ischemia. Likely large contribution of anemia, presumably new given
   recent GI blood loss. Currently asymptomatic.
   - continue ASA, atorvastatin
   - transfuse RBCs to Hct upper 20s.
   - will not likely pursue a cath
   - carvedilol, lisinopril for blood pressure control.
   .
   # Anemia:
   Known to be guaiac positive, although per pt's history, had had
   aggressive bleed several days ago and nothing gross since then. Likely
   lower GI bleed from known internal hemorrhoids.  Elevated BUN suggests
   upper GI source vs contraction.   Hematocrit currently stable at ~28
   - GI will do c-scope and possible EGD on Monday per GI recs
   - f/u iron panel
   - maintain good IV access
   - patient able to tolerate PO, give omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension and heart failure who presented with lightheadedness, anemia, and a troponin leak. He has been diagnosed with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 61 beats per minute, blood pressure of 169/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin T levels. The patient's head CT scan reveals no acute intracranial process, but there are findings consistent with age-related changes and small vessel ischemic disease. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of heart disease and current presentation with NSTEMI and troponin leak, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as unstable angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent GI bleeding and marked mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus suggest a possible recurrence of GI bleeding or development of peptic ulcer disease.
3. Renal complications: Elevated BUN levels may indicate impaired kidney function, which can be associated with dehydration or underlying kidney disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart disease. He presented with lightheadedness and was found to be anemic, hypertensive, and had a troponin leak. The troponin leak is likely due to type II myocardial infarction (MI), which occurs when there is a decrease in oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In this case, the decreased oxygen supply may be caused by anemia resulting from recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

The patient has been on heparin therapy overnight and will have it discontinued. He will continue taking aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Plavix), and a statin for his cardiac condition. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level will be maintained in the upper 20s through red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. A cardiac catheterization will likely not be pursued at this time.

The patient also has anemia, which is likely caused by lower GI bleeding from known internal hemorrhoids. There is a suspicion of an upper GI source as well, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The patient will undergo upper and lower endoscopy on Monday to further evaluate the source of bleeding. The post-transfusion Hct will be checked today, and good IV access will be maintained.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and multiple falls. He presented with lightheadedness, was found to be anemic, hypertensive, and had a troponin leak. The patient has been diagnosed with type II myocardial infarction/demand ischemia, anemia, and possible lower gastrointestinal bleed. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of hypertension, heart failure, and troponin leak suggests a risk for cardiac complications. Possible complications include congestive heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or further myocardial infarction.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and weakness. If not properly managed, it may result in decreased oxygen delivery to vital organs, potentially leading to organ dysfunction.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of internal hemorrhoids and guaiac positive stools indicate a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. Complications such as peptic ulcers, perforation, or severe anemia due to ongoing bleeding may occur if not addressed.
4. Renal Complications: Elevated BUN levels suggest a potential risk for renal impairment. Factors such as dehydration, hypotension, or underlying chronic kidney disease could contribute to renal complications.

   Imaging: CT ABD/CHEST:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Several osseous fragments in left shoulder joint, which is also
   distended
   with fluid. While no overt or displaced fracture is seen, if there is
   recent
   trauma with resulting pain to the left shoulder, MRI may be considered
   for
   assessment for occult fracture. Age-indeterminate anterior/superior
   subluxation of the left glenohumeral joint, likely related to chronic
   rotator
   cuff injury.
   2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the entire aorta and its
   major
   branches, and the coronary arteries.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with history of HTN, HL, multiple falls who presented
   with lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive and s/p troponin
   leak.
   .
   # Type II MI/ Demand Ischemia:
   Known troponin leak to 9 at OSH, trending down. EKG with ST depressions
   laterally unclear if related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed
   ischemia. Likely large contribution of anemia, presumably new given
   recent GI blood loss. Currently asymptomatic.  Will not likely pursue
   cardiac catheterization.
   - continue ASA, atorvastatin
   - transfuse RBCs to Hct upper 20s.
   - carvedilol, lisinopril for blood pressure control.
   .
   # Anemia:
   Per patient, had aggressive bleed several days ago and nothing gross
   since then, has been guaiac positive since then.  Likely lower GI bleed
   from known internal hemorrhoids.  Elevated BUN suggests upper GI source
   vs contraction.   Hematocrit currently stable at ~28.  Finished
   Go-Lytely prep overnight.
   - GI will do colonoscopy today in CCU
   - f/u iron panel
   - maintain good IV access
   - omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # s/p Fall
 head CT negative
   - will continue to follow neurologic exam, mental stutus.
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  stable at 12.  Afebrile ,  negative UA and CXR. No
   signs of infection.
   - will continue to monitor.

   #  Hypertension:
   -          on carvedilol, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide.
   -          Will continue to monitor.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and multiple falls. He presented with lightheadedness and was found to be anemic, hypertensive, and experiencing troponin leak. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests including a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, which revealed osseous fragments in the left shoulder joint and extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the entire aorta and its major branches, as well as the coronary arteries. A CT scan of the head showed no acute intracranial process, but marked left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Type II MI/Demand Ischemia: The patient has a known troponin leak, which is trending down. An EKG showed ST depressions that are unclear whether they are related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed ischemia. The patient is asymptomatic and will not likely pursue cardiac catheterization. The recommended treatment includes continuing ASA and atorvastatin, transfusing RBCs to achieve a hematocrit level above 20, and prescribing carvedilol and lisinopril for blood pressure control.

2. Anemia: The patient had an aggressive bleed several days ago and has been guaiac positive since then, suggesting a likely lower GI bleed from known internal hemorrhoids. The elevated BUN suggests an upper GI source."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with history of HTN, HL, multiple falls who presented
   with lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive and s/p troponin
   leak.
   .
   # Type II MI/ Demand Ischemia:
   Known troponin leak to 9 at OSH, trending down. EKG with ST depressions
   laterally unclear if related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed
   ischemia. Likely large contribution of anemia, presumably new given
   recent GI blood loss. Currently asymptomatic.  Will not likely pursue
   cardiac catheterization.  Hematocrit stable.
   - continue ASA, atorvastatin
   - transfuse as needed RBCs to Hct upper 20s.
   - continue blood pressure control.
   .
   # Anemia:
   Per patient, had aggressive bleed several days ago and nothing gross
   since then, has been guaiac positive since then.  Likely lower GI bleed
   from known internal hemorrhoids.  Elevated BUN suggests upper GI source
   vs contraction. Patient transfused yesterday for hct 26.6.  Colonoscopy
   showed diverticuli yesterday.  Iron panel shows normal TIBC, ferritin
   but low iron.  No new bleeds since night of prep 2 nights ago.
   - start oral iron replacement today.
   - maintain good IV access
   - omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - re-check hct in pm
   - follow up as outpatient with GI.
   .
   # s/p Fall
 head CT negative, no complaints
   - will continue to follow neurologic exam, mental stutus.
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  decreasing now at 11.2.  Afebrile ,  negative UA and
   CXR. No signs of infection.  [**Month (only) 51**] be reactive.
   - will continue to monitor.
   .
   #  Hypertension:
   - on carvedilol, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone
   - Will continue to monitor.
   # Social
 wife is now at [**Hospital3 **].
   -          social work is following , Elder Services
   -          will speak with HCP [**Name (NI) 546**] [**Name (NI) 6627**] about potentially going to
   [**Hospital3 **].

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and multiple falls. He presented with lightheadedness and was found to be anemic, hypertensive, and had elevated cardiac enzymes (troponin leak). The patient experienced a diverticular bleed, leading to anemia and a Type II NSTEMI. He is currently stable in the ICU and is being managed for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of heart failure and the recent troponin leak indicate potential cardiac complications. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure or further myocardial ischemia is important.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has been stabilized after the initial bleed, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding from the known internal hemorrhoids. Close monitoring for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as guaiac-positive stools or a drop in hemoglobin levels, is necessary.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are low due to the recent bleed. Ongoing monitoring and transfusion as needed to maintain hemoglobin levels above 20% are important to prevent further cardiac strain and ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, but no signs of infection are currently present. Monitoring for any signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or changes in vital signs, is important.

5. Hypertension:"
