   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 478**] is a 75 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and
   morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors
   include respiratory supression from overuse of narcotics in the ED,
   pulmonary edema secondary to critical aortic stenosis and myocardial
   demand/ischemia, and underlying OSA.
   - Non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP with backup rate
   - Gave additional 40mg Iasix this AM, will repeat later today if
   necessary, follow I/O and lung exam
   - Avoid narcotics and sedating medications such as trazodone
   - Will hold imdur & hydralazine for now given relative hypotension in
   the setting of narcotics, will restart at home doses and uptitrate as
   tolerated
   - Ultimate treatment would be valvuloplasty vs. [**Known lastname **], unlikely the
   patient is a good candidate for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider valvulopasty during
   this hospitalization
   - Albuterol PRN
   - NPO as aspiration risk
   .
   # Congestive heart failure with preserved EF: due to severe aortic
   stenosis and diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol decreased dose at 12.5mg given relative
   hypotension
   - restart imdur & hydralazine as blood pressures can tolerate
   - IV lasix PRN
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Consider pressors if necessary for low BPs as may not tolerate IVF
   .
   # Severe AS: would likely benefit from an intervention and will have to
   decide whether valvuloplasty or [**First Name3 (LF) **] is the better option for her->if
   she agrees to any intervention at this point will likely have cath
   tomorrow.
   - Family will reverse code status for procedures
   .
   # Troponin leak: clinical picture not consistent with acute coronary
   syndrome, may represent demand ischemia from decompensated heart
   failure.  No h/o cardiac cath to determine if has significant coronary
   artery disease, may require if the patient remains a candidate for [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   - continue aspirin and statin for primary prevention
   - no need for heparin or plavix given unlikely to be ACS
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely secondary to poor forward
   flow secondary to aortic stenosis and aggressive diuresis
   - Hold off on diuretics if not needed
   - Check Urine Lytes, eosinophils
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus:  Monitor FS BG QACHS, home lantus 10mg QHS, [**12-13**]
   when NPO and humalog sliding scale.  Diabetic diet when can tolerate
   .
   # Depression:  Continue celexa
   .
   # GERD, H/O GI Bleeds:  Hct drop to 26.7 on this admission with guaiac
   positive stools.
   - Monitor twice daily hcts, has active T+C, will transfuse if BPs
   decrease and hct decreases but will hold for now given respiratroy
   status.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Continue pantoprazole and GI regimen

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, severe aortic stenosis, troponin leak, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory suppression from overuse of narcotics in the ED, pulmonary edema secondary to critical aortic stenosis, and myocardial demand/ischemia. Non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP with backup rate has been initiated, and additional 40mg of Lasix has been given. Monitoring of I/O and lung exam will be continued.
2. Congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea. She is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to multiple factors including respiratory suppression from overuse of narcotics, pulmonary edema secondary to critical aortic stenosis and myocardial demand/ischemia, and underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP with a backup rate is being used to support her breathing.

2. Congestive Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF): The patient is also suffering from congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which is caused by severe aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure. Treatment includes continuing metoprolol at a decreased dose of 12.5mg, restarting imdur and hydralazine, and using IV lasix as needed. Monitoring of I/Os and daily weights is also important.

3. Troponin Leak: The patient's elevated troponin levels may indicate a troponin leak, but the clinical picture does not suggest acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It may be related to demand ischemia from decompensated heart failure. Daily EKGs will be continued.

   and lung exam
   - Avoid narcotics and sedating medications such as trazodone
   - cont to hold imdur & hydralazine given low BP
   - Plan for  valvuloplasty after evaluation of coronaries to exclude
   cardiac ischemia as etiology of current presentation.  Pt will likely
   need to be intubated prior to procedure b/c can

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity. She presents with dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been oversedated from narcotics in the ED but has since resolved. She is on high-flow oxygen to maintain O2 saturation above 90%. Lasix is being given to achieve negative fluid balance of 250-500cc today. Narcotics and sedating medications like trazodone are avoided. Im Dur and hydralazine are held due to low blood pressure. The plan is for valvuloplasty after evaluation of coronaries to exclude cardiac ischemia as the etiology of her current presentation. Intubation is likely required prior to the procedure. Albuterol is given as needed, and the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to an increased risk of aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure due to severe aortic stenosis, myocardial demand/ischemia, and underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This could be exacerbated by oversedation from narcotics.
2. Congestive Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF): The patient has severe aortic stenosis leading to diastolic heart failure and congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This can result in fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 478**], a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity, presents with dyspnea. She has a history of respiratory failure, congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, severe AS, troponin leak, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, depression, GERD with GI bleeds, and UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying OSA and critical aortic stenosis can lead to respiratory suppression from overuse of narcotics in the ED, pulmonary edema, and myocardial demand/ischemia.
2. Congestive Heart Failure with Preserved EF: Severe aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure may cause fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema.
3. Severe AS: Valvuloplasty is planned in the future after evaluation of coronaries.
4. Troponin Leak: Clinical picture not consistent with acute coronary syndrome, may represent demand ischemia from decompensated heart failure.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Poor forward flow secondary to aortic stenosis and previous aggressive diuresis may worsen renal function.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: Poor glycemic control can lead to hyperglycemia and associated complications.
7. Depression: Continuation of celexa may be necessary to manage depressive symptoms.

   There is no interval change. There are again seen opacities at the lung
   bases
   bilaterally. There is likely also a right-sided pleural effusion. There
   are
   no signs for overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is upper
   limits of
   normal.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 478**] is a 75 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and
   morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: most likely secondary to pulmonary edema from
   critical aortic stenosis and myocardial demand/ischemia, and underlying
   OSA.  Pt had oversedation from narcotics in ED but somnolence has
   sinced resolved.
   - continue high flow O2 to keep O2 sat>90%
   - start lasix gtt, goal negative 250-500cc negative today - follow I/O
   and lung exam
   - Avoid narcotics and sedating medications such as trazodone
   - cont to hold imdur & hydralazine given low BP
   - Plan for  valvuloplasty after evaluation of coronaries to exclude
   cardiac ischemia as etiology of current presentation.  Pt will likely
   need to be intubated prior to procedure b/c can
t lie flat.
   - Albuterol PRN
   - NPO as aspiration risk
   .
   # Congestive heart failure with preserved EF: due to severe aortic
   stenosis and diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol decreased dose at 12.5mg given relative
   hypotension
   - hold imdur & hydralazine  given low BP
   - lasix gtt as above
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Consider pressors if necessary for low BPs as may not tolerate IVF
   .
   # Severe AS: Will consider valvuloplasty in future after evaluation of
   coronaries.  In addition, concern re: ability to access arterial system
   given severe PVD
   - femoral artery u/s bilat today
   - Family will reverse code status for procedures
   .
   # Troponin leak: clinical picture not consistent with acute coronary
   syndrome, may represent demand ischemia from decompensated heart
   failure.  No h/o cardiac cath to determine if has significant coronary
   artery disease, may require if the patient remains a candidate for AVR
   - continue aspirin and statin for primary prevention
   - no need for heparin or plavix given unlikely to be ACS
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely secondary to poor forward
   flow secondary to aortic stenosis and previous aggressive diuresis.  Pt
   FE Urea consistent with intrinsic etiology.
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus:  Monitor FS BG QACHS, home lantus 10mg QHS, [**12-13**]
   when NPO and humalog sliding scale.  Diabetic diet when can tolerate
   .
   # Depression:  Continue celexa
   .
   # GERD, H/O GI Bleeds:  Hct at 30 s/p 2units PRBC o/n.  Pt with with
   guaiac positive stools this admission.
   - Monitor twice daily hcts, has active T+C, will transfuse if BPs
   decrease and hct decreases but will hold for now given respiratroy
   status.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Continue pantoprazole and GI regimen

s H+P,
   A+P above and would add the follwing:
   1)       It is apparent that even aortic valvuloplasty carries
   substantial risk in this patient.  PVD limits access sites
 and dye
   load has significant chance of resulting in need for dialysis.  It also
   would require coronary angiography and elective intubation.
   2)       The patient has repeatedly stated that her wishes are to
   her go
.  Her son and family were present this morning when she
   restated these wishes.
   3)       The patient is not a surgical candidate as her mortality from
   surgery would be prohibitive.
   Based on the above, the family and patient have decided to pursue
   comfort measures only and the patient remains DNR/DNI.
   90 minutes spent on patient critical care.  ICU level care due to
   severely compromised respiratory status.

She has a history of congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, acute on chronic renal failure, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high-flow nasal cannula. She is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur along with bilateral lower extremity edema and 2+ edema up to the knees. Her urine output has been low, at 20-50 mL/hr. She has a positive blood glucose test, and her laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and troponin T. Her urinalysis indicates the presence of many yeast cells, and her chest X-ray reveals opacities at the lung bases bilaterally with a right-sided pleural effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 478**] is a 75 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and
   morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors
   include respiratory supression from overuse of narcotics in the ED,
   pulmonary edema secondary to critical aortic stenosis and myocardial
   demand/ischemia, and underlying OSA.
   - Non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP with backup rate
   - Gave additional 40mg Iasix this AM, will repeat later today if
   necessary, follow I/O and lung exam
   - Avoid narcotics and sedating medications such as trazodone
   - Will hold imdur & hydralazine for now given relative hypotension in
   the setting of narcotics, will restart at home doses and uptitrate as
   tolerated
   - Ultimate treatment would be valvuloplasty vs. [**Known lastname **], unlikely the
   patient is a good candidate for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider valvulopasty during
   this hospitalization
   - Albuterol PRN
   - NPO as aspiration risk
   .
   # Congestive heart failure with preserved EF: due to severe aortic
   stenosis and diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol decreased dose at 12.5mg given relative
   hypotension
   - restart imdur & hydralazine as blood pressures can tolerate
   - IV lasix PRN
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Consider pressors if necessary for low BPs as may not tolerate IVF
   .
   # Severe AS: would likely benefit from an intervention and will have to
   decide whether valvuloplasty or [**First Name3 (LF) **] is the better option for her->if

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, congestive heart failure with preserved EF, severe AS, troponin leak, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, depression, and GERD with a history of GI bleeds. 

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and potassium levels, as well as decreased hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and magnesium levels. Troponin-T and TCO2 levels are within normal range. 

The patient's plan includes non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP, additional diuretics, avoidance of narcotics, and consideration for valvuloplasty. The patient is NPO due to aspiration risk and will have a FEN tomorrow. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the family has agreed to this decision. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if the non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP is not effective or if there is an increase in narcotic use leading to respiratory suppression.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure may progress if diuretics are not adequately managed or"

   are
   no signs for overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is upper

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 478**] is a 75 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and
   morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors
   include respiratory supression from overuse of narcotics in the ED,
   pulmonary edema secondary to critical aortic stenosis and myocardial
   demand/ischemia, and underlying OSA.
   - Non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP with backup rate
   - Gave additional 40mg Iasix this AM, will repeat later today if
   necessary, follow I/O and lung exam
   - Avoid narcotics and sedating medications such as trazodone
   - Will hold imdur & hydralazine for now given relative hypotension in
   the setting of narcotics, will restart at home doses and uptitrate as
   tolerated
   - Plan for  valvuloplasty today.  Pt will likely need to be intubated
   prior to procedure b/c can
t lie flat.
   - Albuterol PRN
   - NPO as aspiration risk
   .
   # Congestive heart failure with preserved EF: due to severe aortic
   stenosis and diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol decreased dose at 12.5mg given relative
   hypotension
   - restart imdur & hydralazine as blood pressures can tolerate
   - IV lasix PRN
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Consider pressors if necessary for low BPs as may not tolerate IVF
   .
   # Severe AS: possible valvuloplasty today
   - Family will reverse code status for procedures
   .
   # Troponin leak: clinical picture not consistent with acute coronary
   syndrome, may represent demand ischemia from decompensated heart
   failure.  No h/o cardiac cath to determine if has significant coronary
   artery disease, may require if the patient remains a candidate for AVR
   - continue aspirin and statin for primary prevention
   - no need for heparin or plavix given unlikely to be ACS
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely secondary to poor forward
   flow secondary to aortic stenosis and previous aggressive diuresis.  Pt
   FE Urea consistent with intrinsic etiology.
   - Use diuretics sparingly to treat SOB.
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus:  Monitor FS BG QACHS, home lantus 10mg QHS, [**12-13**]
   when NPO and humalog sliding scale.  Diabetic diet when can tolerate
   .
   # Depression:  Continue celexa
   .
   # GERD, H/O GI Bleeds:  Hct at 30 s/p 2units PRBC o/n on this admission
   with guaiac positive stools.
   - Monitor twice daily hcts, has active T+C, will transfuse if BPs
   decrease and hct decreases but will hold for now given respiratroy
   status.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Continue pantoprazole and GI regimen

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity. She presents with dyspnea and is currently admitted to the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/45 mmHg to 64/27 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur with no S2, no wheezes or rhonchi, soft abdomen with no tenderness or guarding, and 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 218 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, sodium level of 134 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, glucose level of 165 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.42. The urine analysis indicates cloudy appearance with many yeast cells, and the chest X-ray shows opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, likely indicating a right-sided pleural effusion. 

The patient has several medical conditions, including respiratory failure, congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, severe aortic stenosis, troponin leak, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding history. 

The plan for the patient includes non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP, administration of additional lasix, avoidance of narcotics and sedating medications, intubation prior to valvuloplasty, and monitoring for congestive heart failure symptoms. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, further deterioration of renal function, uncontrolled diabetes, development of pulmonary edema, and complications related to the planned valvuloplasty procedure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 478**] is a 75 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and
   morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors
   include respiratory supression from overuse of narcotics in the ED,
   pulmonary edema secondary to critical aortic stenosis and myocardial
   demand/ischemia, and underlying OSA.
   -continue high flow O2 to keep O2 sat>90%
   - start lasix gtt, goal negative 250-500cc negative today - follow I/O
   and lung exam
   - Avoid narcotics and sedating medications such as trazodone
   - Will hold imdur & hydralazine for now given relative hypotension in
   the setting of narcotics, will restart at home doses and uptitrate as
   tolerated
   - Plan for  valvuloplasty after evaluation of coronaries to exclude
   cardiac ischemia as etiology of current presentation.  Pt will likely
   need to be intubated prior to procedure b/c can
t lie flat.
   - Albuterol PRN
   - NPO as aspiration risk
   .
   # Congestive heart failure with preserved EF: due to severe aortic
   stenosis and diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol decreased dose at 12.5mg given relative
   hypotension
   - restart imdur & hydralazine as blood pressures can tolerate
   - IV lasix PRN
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Consider pressors if necessary for low BPs as may not tolerate IVF
   .
   # Severe AS: Will consider valvuloplasty in future after evaluation of
   coronaries
   - Family will reverse code status for procedures
   .
   # Troponin leak: clinical picture not consistent with acute coronary
   syndrome, may represent demand ischemia from decompensated heart
   failure.  No h/o cardiac cath to determine if has significant coronary
   artery disease, may require if the patient remains a candidate for AVR
   - continue aspirin and statin for primary prevention
   - no need for heparin or plavix given unlikely to be ACS
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely secondary to poor forward
   flow secondary to aortic stenosis and previous aggressive diuresis.  Pt
   FE Urea consistent with intrinsic etiology.
   - Use diuretics sparingly to treat SOB.
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus:  Monitor FS BG QACHS, home lantus 10mg QHS, [**12-13**]
   when NPO and humalog sliding scale.  Diabetic diet when can tolerate
   .
   # Depression:  Continue celexa
   .
   # GERD, H/O GI Bleeds:  Hct at 30 s/p 2units PRBC o/n on this admission
   with guaiac positive stools.
   - Monitor twice daily hcts, has active T+C, will transfuse if BPs
   decrease and hct decreases but will hold for now given respiratroy
   status.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Continue pantoprazole and GI regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, congestive heart failure with preserved EF, severe AS, troponin leak, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, depression, GERD, and a history of GI bleeds.

24-hour events include:
- I/O was 20-50 mL/hr, so no further lasix was given.
- PM hct was 24.1, so the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells with lasix 40 mg IV before the blood went in. This was done because her saturation levels dropped to the 80s prior to blood transfusion and then improved.
- BPs were transiently low at 2 pm, and consideration was given to using dopamine, but the patient's blood pressure stabilized, so it was held off.
- The plan for valvuloplasty in the morning was discussed.
- The patient received fluconazole as a single dose for yeast but did not treat the dirty urinary catheter since there was no fever or leukocytosis.

Infusions and other ICU medications include:
- Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) started on [**2138-4-6**] at 02:00 PM.
- Furosemide (Lasix) started on [**213"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with critical non-operative aortic stenosis admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and comfort measures only are being provided. The patient appears comfortable, and pain and palliative care involvement have been appreciated. Narcotic, anxiolytic, and antiemetic medications are being titrated to comfort. Scopolamine patch has been added for secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, indicating a potential risk of inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Aortic stenosis: The patient's critical non-operative aortic stenosis increases the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias, and syncope.
3. Sepsis: Although there is no clear evidence of infection in the progress note, the presence of antibiotics suggests a potential risk of sepsis, especially if the patient had an underlying infection.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, which may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension.
5. Medication side effects: The use of narcotics and anxiolytics can lead to respiratory depression and sedation. Antiemetics may cause extrapyramidal symptoms or QT prolongation.
6. Delirium: In critically ill patients, especially those receiving sedatives and analgesics, delirium is a common complication.
7. Pressure injuries: P"

The patient's preferences for transfer to the floor or home with hospice will be considered if death is not imminent. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, which could potentially worsen if respiratory support is not maintained.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to critical illness and prolonged hospital stay, increasing the risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins, potentially leading to DVT.
4. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and prolonged bed rest can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low"
