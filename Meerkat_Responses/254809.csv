The patient is a 74-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), adrenal insufficiency, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic right pleural effusion. He was recently in the ICU for a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest believed to be caused by a mucus plug. The patient was extubated on [12-20] and transferred to the floor, but he returned to the MICU on [12-24] with worsening hypoxemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 136/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His general appearance is unresponsive, and his chest examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side with absent breath sounds posteriorly. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL, platelet count of 261 K/uL, creatinine of 3.8 mg/dL, and glucose of 89 mg/dL. Blood cultures have grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The chest X-ray shows near-complete op"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), adrenal insufficiency, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He has a history of chronic right pleural effusion and was recently in the ICU for a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was believed to be caused by a mucus plug. The patient was extubated on December 20th and transferred to the floor, but he returned to the MICU on December 24th due to worsening hypoxemia.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 136/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His general appearance is unresponsive, and his chest exam reveals absent breath sounds over the right side. The patient has a gastrointestinal tube (G tube) in place.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin (Hct), creatinine (Cr), lactate, and lactic acid, as well as decreased levels of platelets (Plt), albumin, potassium (K+), and sodium (Na+). Imaging shows near-complete opacification of the right side of the chest, worse than previous CXRs.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), respiratory failure, pneumonia, altered mental status, and possible neurosyphilis. He has been admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently intubated on a face tent with 35% FiO2. He also has a multi-lumen central line, midline catheter, and is receiving vasopressors for hypotension.

The patient's recent events include an acute bleed from the PEG tube, which required transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He has been started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and is planned for an early morning upper endoscopy (EGD). The patient's sputum culture showed extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions, and his respiratory culture was canceled.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to ICU delirium or toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. He has been started on ceftriaxone for possible neurosyphilis. His ESRD is managed with dialysis, and he has mild volume overload. His pacemaker is functioning properly, and he has a history of diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) requiring insulin.

The patient's care plan includes ongoing monitoring, pulmonary toilet, NPO status, and consideration for tracheostomy to limit aspiration potential"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), respiratory failure, pneumonia, possible neurosyphilis, and altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has had several acute events.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure due to a mucous plug in the right mainstem bronchus. He also has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding from the PEG tube, which required transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to further evaluate and manage the GIB.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors including sedation, the ICU setting, and possible toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. He is also suspected to have neurosyphilis, for which ceftriaxone therapy has been initiated.

The patient has a history of myocardial stunning from hypoxia, contusion from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and a previous pulmonary embolism. He requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration.

The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESRD, resulting in mild volume overload. Dialysis will be required to manage his renal needs.

Additionally, the patient has a pacemaker in place, which was interrogated and showed no"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times, most recently for recurrent right lung collapse and mucus plugging. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) event earlier in the hospital course. On the current admission, he presented with frank blood output from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, which was cleared by lavage. The patient received a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip, central venous line (CVL) placement for blood transfusion, and two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). A gastrointestinal (GI) consult has been obtained regarding possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

24-hour events:
- Noted to have frank blood output from PEG, placed NGT, and lavage x 1L with eventual clearance.
- Started on PPI drip, placed CVL for blood transfusion; given PRBC x 2 units.
- GI consult obtained regarding possible EGD.
- HCT stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He presented with recurrent right lung collapse and pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient had frank blood output from a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and a nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed for lavage. He was started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and received blood transfusions. A gastrointestinal (GI) consult was obtained regarding possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: There is a possibility of ongoing upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed or nasopharyngeal source bleeding. The patient is currently being managed with a PPI and avoidance of nasal suctioning. An EGD may not be immediately necessary given the evidence of stability, and the NGT may be discontinued.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): There are no significant signs of active PNA without fevers or leukocytosis. The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone for neurosyphilis and coverage of klebsiella; a 14-day course is planned.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent mucus plugging, but currently has adequate oxygenation. Pulmonary toilet will continue, and the utility"

   not improve. Mr [**Known lastname 5787**]
s daughter expressed concern regarding his
   tenuous respiratory status
 explained that major change is the lack of
   a good cough to clear secretions and high chance of recurrent
   aspiration. I recommended we involve the palliative care service for
   home hospice recognizing that home hospice would not be an option if
   hemodialysis is continued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to recurrent right lung collapse and mucus plugging. The patient had frank blood output from a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, for which a nasogastric tube (NGT) and lavage were placed. He was started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVL) for blood transfusion. The patient also received packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfusion. A gastrointestinal consult was obtained regarding possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone on [**2163-12-25**] at 05:00 AM. He is currently receiving infusions of pantoprazole (Protonix) at 8 mg/hour and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include simvastatin, folic acid, multivitamins (MVI), insulin sliding scale, and prednisone 5 mg daily.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted above and below. His vital signs include a temperature of 35"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including ESRD (end-stage renal disease), altered mental status, a recent PEA (pulseless electrical activity) arrest, hypotension, hypoxemia, and possible neurosyphilis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has experienced several complications.

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has frank blood coming from the PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube. He is receiving 2 units of PRBCs (packed red blood cells) and will undergo a post-transfusion HCT (hematocrit) to assess the response. An EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) was initially planned but has been put on hold due to the patient's tenuous respiratory status.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's previous event likely involved a mucous plug, leading to breathing difficulties. He is currently stable on a face tent with 35% FiO2 for humidification. Pseudomonas in the sputum is considered a contaminant, and the patient is being kept right-side up to ensure proper perfusion. Chain respirations are also present, likely resulting from neuro disease.

3. Hypotension: The patient's shock was likely due to myocardial stunning from hypoxia and contusion from CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). His PEA arrest"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a history of large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is currently non-responsive and has experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Unresponsive: The patient is non-responsive, and palliative care has been consulted. The family will be having a meeting to discuss the possibility of taking the patient home, which would likely require a tracheostomy for suctioning at home.

2. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): There is no more blood from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and the gastrointestinal (GI) department does not want to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) given the patient's tenuous respiratory status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with significant residual deficits, and currently admitted to the ICU for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient is now experiencing recurrent hypoxemia due to a mucus plug and collapse. The patient's mental status remains unimproved, likely as a result of the recent PEA. There are several potential medical complications that can arise, including acute respiratory failure/hypoxemia, altered mental status, possible neurosyphilis, chronic renal failure, nasal pharyngeal bleed/anemia, and goals of care with palliative care consultation requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure/hypoxemia: The patient's recurrent hypoxemia needs close monitoring and management to ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status remains unimproved, which may be due to the recent PEA. Continuous monitoring and assessment of the patient's neurological status are necessary.

3. Possible neurosyphilis: The patient's presentation raises the possibility of neurosyphilis, which needs further investigation and appropriate treatment.

4. Chronic renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is on HD. Monitoring kidney function and providing ongoing renal support are essential.

5. Nasal pharyngeal bleed/anemia: Although less likely due to GI bleed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who was transferred to the ICU in a setting of pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient now presents with recurrent hypoxemia due to a mucus plug and collapse. The patient's mental status remains unimproved, likely as a result of recent PEA. Possible neurosyphilis is also considered. The patient has chronic renal failure and is scheduled for hemodialysis today. A nasal pharyngeal bleed is less likely, and repeat HCT tomorrow is planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's recurrent hypoxemia needs to be closely monitored and managed with NT suctioning as needed.
2. Neurological status: The patient's mental status remains unimproved, indicating a potential ongoing neurological impairment, possibly due to recent PEA.
3. Possible neurosyphilis: This is a potential complication that needs further investigation and management.
4. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure requires ongoing hemodialysis management to maintain kidney function.
5. Nasal pharyngeal bleed: Although less likely, the patient's nasal pharyngeal bleed should be monitored, and repeat HCT tomorrow is planned to assess the situation.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a large cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who is currently unresponsive after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status (MS).

The patient's recent events include palliative care meetings with the family to discuss the possibility of bringing him home, including the placement of a tracheostomy for easier suctioning. The patient also requires a fistula repair prior to discharge from the hospital due to high risk of rupture. The patient has been receiving intermittent suctioning and treatment for possible pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with possible neurosyphilis and is being treated with intravenous penicillin G.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis, and vasculopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has impaired respiratory function and requires respiratory support. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include ineffective coping, impaired airway clearance, impaired knowledge, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, gastrointestinal bleed (other), respiratory failure (acute), pneumonia (other), renal failure (end-stage), alteration in nutrition, and possible neurosyphilis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include further respiratory deterioration, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection due to impaired immune response, worsening renal function, and complications related to diabetes mellitus type II."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic pleural effusion, and a large cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently unresponsive and has had a past perfused cardiac arrest (PEA arrest). The patient has multiple medical complications including ineffective coping, impaired airway clearance, impaired knowledge, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, gastrointestinal bleed (other), respiratory failure (acute), pneumonia (other), renal failure (end stage), alteration in nutrition, and possible neurosyphilis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management. There is also a possibility of pneumonia, and the need for tracheostomy (trach) to facilitate easier suctioning at home.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: Although there is no active bleeding currently, the patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and close observation for any signs of bleeding are necessary.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires ongoing dialysis management. Repair of the fistula prior to discharge from the hospital is recommended by the transplant surgery team.

4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and non-responsive condition may indicate neurological complications. Further evaluation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who recently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) event. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with no respiratory events in the past 48 hours. Mental status remains unchanged due to encephalopathy. There are no known drug allergies, and the patient's current medications include ceftriaxone, pantoprazole, simvastatin, vitamins, insulin sliding scale, glargine, prednisone, and Afrin nasal spray.

Vital signs show a slightly low blood pressure of 102/49 mmHg, but other parameters such as heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation are within normal range. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and has had a balance of 215 mL in the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate stable kidney function with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 199 K/uL. Other lab values, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver function tests, are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's overall condition remains stable, with improvement in respiratory status. The neurologic status is close to baseline, and the patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon. The plan includes continuing pulmonary toilet and"

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (ESRD) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who experienced a recent episode of pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 102/49 to 146/80 mmHg, heart rate between 73 and 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 18 and 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on aerosol-cool delivery device. The patient is somnolent but opens eyes and moans to voice, with clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and minimal edema.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low calcium and magnesium levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is assessed with respiratory failure, neurologic stability close to baseline, end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and general goals of care discussed with the family. The plan includes continued pulmonary toilet, consideration for transfer to the floor, hemodialysis, and glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale.
