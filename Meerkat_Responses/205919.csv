","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU. They have been receiving various medications and infusions, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, and enoxaparin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device.

Physical examination findings are not mentioned for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Troponin-T is below the detection limit, while glucose levels are slightly elevated. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and ongoing cultures suggest the possibility of an infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection, such as fever or increased respiratory distress.

2. Thromboembolism: The patient is receiving enoxaparin, an anticoagulant used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and assessing for any signs of bleeding complications are essential.

3. Stress Ul"

   86 M with DM and 100-pack year tobacco hx admitted with R acetabular
   fracture now POD#3 s/p R acetabular repair [**9-27**] with post-op hypoxia now
   weaned down from NRB to nasal cannula.
   Plan per admit note with the following additions and changes.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient now weaned down from NRB to nasal cannula. DDx
   includes post-op atelectasis, emphysema, PNA, and fluid overload s/p
   transfusion of 5units PRBCs since surgery
   -- continue vanc/levo for now, follow culture data
   -- aggressive use of incentive spirometry as CXR showed low lung
   volumes c/w atelectasis
   -- continue ipratroprium
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with large pelvic fracture apparently with large
   amount of free fluid on pelvic floor prior to surgery. This is likely
   source of scrotal hematoma but would want to r/o continued bleed as has
   received 5units PRBCs since surgery and Hct has been stable but has not
   bumped appropriately.
   -- CT scan of abdomen/pelvis to r/o RP bleed and also assess distended
   abdomen
   -- urology to assess patient
s scrotal hematoma swelling today
   -- continue to monitor Hct Q8hr
   .
   #. s/p Hypotension: Patient reported to have hypotension to SBP 80s on
   floor. Concern for sepsis however no fever, white count, or source for
   infection. Patient
s BP has remained at baseline between SBP 110-120s
   overnight
   -- monitor closely
   -- continue to hold home losartan
   .
   # s/p percutaneous pinning acetabular fx: POD#3 today.
   -- ortho team following
   -- continue oxycodone for pain control, can discontinue IV morphine.
   -- continue post op lovenox, Ca, vit D
   -- PT involved, but goal is to have patient OOB to chair with assist
   today
   .
   # s/p post-op afib: Brief lasting about an hour in the setting of
   getting an albuterol neb. Would avoid inhaled beta agonists. Converted
   back to sinus with 10mg of IV dilt on the floor. Not on any maintenance
   orders and on transfer to the MICU the patient was in sinus rhythm.
   -- avoid albuterol
   -- continue telemetry
   ..
   # Hematuria: from trauma. Urology following. Patient with large scrotal
   hematoma which could be [**2-24**] foley trauma vs unclear procedure in
   suprapubic area.
   -- urology following, appreciate recs. Have urology come and reevaluate
   scrotal hematoma today
   -- continue foley
   -- f/u UA, UCx
   .
   # DM: Hold metformin since he got contrast from CTA.
   -- use insulin sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: BP stable but will continue to hold home losartan
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Advance to regular diabetic diet
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin sliding scale for coverage.

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with diabetes and a 100-pack year tobacco history, admitted with a right acetabular fracture. He underwent surgery on 9/27 and is now on POD#3. He was initially on NRB but has been weaned down to a nasal cannula. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.1Â°F), current temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), heart rate of 95 bpm with a range of 89-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/57 mmHg to 124/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute with a range of 22-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's flow sheet data shows that he has received a total of 283 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 120 mL of urine and 163 mL of IV fluids. His blood product transfusion was 212 mL. The patient's blood cultures were drawn at 09:00 PM on 9/29, urine culture at 09:00 PM on 9/29, and sputum culture at 12:18 AM on 9/30. He has been receiving levofloxacin since 10:42 PM on 9/29 and vancomycin since 09:31 AM on 9/30. The patient has also been receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) since 11:00 PM on 9/29 and enoxaparin (Lovenox) since 08:00 AM on 9/30.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles and moderate air movement, no lower airway disease or jugular venous distention, a distended and tympanic abdomen, and a right hip without pain, along with a large scrotal hematoma and tense ecchymoses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 93 K/uL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, troponin-T of less than 0.01 ng/mL, and blood glucose of 189 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of hypoxia, anemia, potential sepsis, post-operative complications, and ongoing monitoring. The patient's conditions that can potentially arise include atelectasis, pneumonia, fluid overload, continued bleeding, and possible complications related to the pelvic fracture and surgery."

   # Hypoxia: Patient now weaned down from NRB to nasal cannula. DDx
   includes post-op atelectasis, emphysema, PNA, and fluid overload s/p
   transfusion of 5units PRBCs since surgery
   -- continue vanc/levo for now, follow culture data
   -- aggressive use of incentive spirometry as CXR showed low lung
   volumes c/w atelectasis
   -- continue ipratroprium
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with large pelvic fracture apparently with large
   amount of free fluid on pelvic floor prior to surgery. This is likely
   source of scrotal hematoma but would want to r/o continued bleed as has
   received 5units PRBCs since surgery and Hct has been stable but has not
   bumped appropriately.
   -- CT scan of abdomen/pelvis to r/o RP bleed and also assess distended
   abdomen
   -- urology to assess patient
s scrotal hematoma swelling today
   -- continue to monitor Hct Q8hr
   .
   #. s/p Hypotension: Patient reported to have hypotension to SBP 80s on
   floor. Concern for sepsis however no fever, white count, or source for
   infection. Patient
s BP has remained at baseline between SBP 110-120s
   overnight

   -- PT involved, but goal is to have patient OOB to chair with assist
   today
   .
   # s/p post-op afib: Brief lasting about an hour in the setting of
   getting an albuterol neb. Would avoid inhaled beta agonists. Converted
   back to sinus with 10mg of IV dilt on the floor. Not on any maintenance
   orders and on transfer to the MICU the patient was in sinus rhythm.
   -- avoid albuterol
   -- continue telemetry

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of diabetes and smoking, admitted for a right acetabular fracture. He underwent surgery for the fracture and is now on the third postoperative day (POD#3). The patient has been weaned down from non-rebreather mask to a nasal cannula for respiratory support. He is pleasant and awake, with no apparent use of accessory muscles to breathe. Physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles and moderate air movement in the lungs, as well as a distended abdomen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/57 mmHg to 124/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on nasal cannula. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory support has been weaned down to a nasal cannula. Differential diagnoses include post-operative atelectasis, emphysema, pneumonia, and fluid overload due to transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since surgery. The plan includes continuing vancomycin and levofloxacin, following culture data, using incentive spirometry aggressively due to low lung volumes seen on chest X-ray, and continuing ipratroprium.
2. Anemia: The patient has a large pelvic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with diabetes and a significant history of tobacco use. He was admitted with a right acetabular fracture and underwent surgery for repair on POD#4. Postoperatively, he experienced hypoxia, likely due to atelectasis, emphysema, and pneumonia with gram-positive cocci in the sputum. The patient also has large scrotal and suprapubic hematomas, an ileus, and lethargy. His blood counts show anemia, and he has received 5 units of packed red blood cells since surgery. He has been stable hemodynamically but experienced episodes of tachycardia and atrial fibrillation postoperatively. The patient's medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to a combination of factors such as postoperative atelectasis, emphysema, and pneumonia. Aggressive use of incentive spirometry, continued antibiotics, and weaning off narcotics are recommended.
2. Bowel ileus: The patient has evidence of bowel ileus on CT abdomen/pelvis. Narcotic use is a likely cause, and measures to decompress the bowel with an NG tube and provide narcan may be necessary.
3. Lethargy: The patient's lethargy is likely due to narcotics, but other causes should be considered. Mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following a severe lower respiratory tract infection. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. Upon admission, the patient was in critical condition, requiring mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic support.

24-hour events include a stable hematocrit overnight, a scrotal hematoma likely caused by blood from the pelvic floor tracking down, growth of Gram-positive cocci in sputum culture, and ileus as seen on computed tomography (CT) abdomen. The patient was given a Fleets enema to relieve stool and gas. During transfer from bed to chair, the patient experienced narrow complex tachycardia at a heart rate of 160 beats per minute and then developed atrial fibrillation, which resolved into normal sinus rhythm at a heart rate of 90 beats per minute after administration of 5mg IV Lopressor. The patient was started on diltiazem 30mg PO QID for rate control.

Infusions include Enoxaparin (Lovenox), Morphine sulfate, and Pantoprazole (Protonix). Other medications include changes to medical and family history, with no known drug allergies. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   fracture now POD#3 s/p R acetabular repair [**9-27**] with post-op hypoxia now
   weaned down from NRB to nasal cannula.
   Plan per admit note with the following additions and changes.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient now weaned down from NRB to nasal cannula. DDx
   includes post-op atelectasis, emphysema, PNA, and fluid overload s/p
   transfusion of 5units PRBCs since surgery
   -- continue vanc/levo for now, follow culture data
   -- aggressive use of incentive spirometry as CXR showed low lung
   volumes c/w atelectasis
   -- continue ipratroprium
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with large pelvic fracture apparently with large
   amount of free fluid on pelvic floor prior to surgery. This is likely
   source of scrotal hematoma but would want to r/o continued bleed as has
   received 5units PRBCs since surgery and Hct has been stable but has not
   bumped appropriately.
   -- CT scan of abdomen/pelvis to r/o RP bleed and also assess distended
   abdomen
   -- urology to assess patient
s scrotal hematoma swelling today
   -- continue to monitor Hct Q8hr
   .
   #. s/p Hypotension: Patient reported to have hypotension to SBP 80s on
   floor. Concern for sepsis however no fever, white count, or source for
   infection. Patient
s BP has remained at baseline between SBP 110-120s
   overnight
   -- monitor closely
   -- continue to hold home losartan
   .
   # s/p percutaneous pinning acetabular fx: POD#3 today.
   -- ortho team following
   -- continue oxycodone for pain control, can discontinue IV morphine.
   -- continue post op lovenox, Ca, vit D
   -- PT involved, but goal is to have patient OOB to chair with assist
   today
   .
   # s/p post-op afib: Brief lasting about an hour in the setting of
   getting an albuterol neb. Would avoid inhaled beta agonists. Converted
   back to sinus with 10mg of IV dilt on the floor. Not on any maintenance
   orders and on transfer to the MICU the patient was in sinus rhythm.
   -- avoid albuterol
   -- continue telemetry
   ..
   # Hematuria: from trauma. Urology following. Patient with large scrotal
   hematoma which could be [**2-24**] foley trauma vs unclear procedure in
   suprapubic area.
   -- urology following, appreciate recs. Have urology come and reevaluate
   scrotal hematoma today
   -- continue foley
   -- f/u UA, UCx
   .
   # DM: Hold metformin since he got contrast from CTA.
   -- use insulin sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: BP stable but will continue to hold home losartan
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Advance to regular diabetic diet

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and a 100-pack year tobacco history who was admitted with a right acetabular fracture. He underwent surgery for the fracture and is now on the third postoperative day (POD#3). The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hypoxia, anemia, hypotension, postoperative atrial fibrillation, hematuria, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are consistently below normal, indicating inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. This could be due to post-operative atelectasis, emphysema, pneumonia, or fluid overload. The patient is currently on vancomycin and levofoxacin, and incentive spirometry is being used to prevent further atelectasis. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to address this issue.

2. Anemia: The patient has received a significant amount of blood transfusions since surgery, but his hematocrit (Hct) levels have not improved appropriately. This suggests ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis is planned to rule out any ongoing bleeding, particularly in the retroperitoneal space. The urology team will also assess the scrotal hematoma for any potential sources of bleeding.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension with a blood pressure in the"

   fracture now POD#3 s/p R acetabular repair [**9-27**] with post-op hypoxia now
   weaned down from NRB to nasal cannula.
   Plan per admit note with the following additions and changes.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient now weaned down from NRB to nasal cannula. DDx
   includes post-op atelectasis, emphysema, PNA, and fluid overload s/p
   transfusion of 5units PRBCs since surgery
   -- continue vanc/levo for now, follow culture data
   -- aggressive use of incentive spirometry as CXR showed low lung
   volumes c/w atelectasis
   -- continue ipratroprium
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with large pelvic fracture apparently with large
   amount of free fluid on pelvic floor prior to surgery. This is likely
   source of scrotal hematoma but would want to r/o continued bleed as has
   received 5units PRBCs since surgery and Hct has been stable but has not
   bumped appropriately.
   -- CT scan of abdomen/pelvis to r/o RP bleed and also assess distended
   abdomen
   -- urology to assess patient
s scrotal hematoma swelling today
   -- continue to monitor Hct Q8hr
   .
   #. s/p Hypotension: Patient reported to have hypotension to SBP 80s on
   floor. Concern for sepsis however no fever, white count, or source for
   infection. Patient
s BP has remained at baseline between SBP 110-120s
   overnight
   -- monitor closely
   -- continue to hold home losartan
   .
   # s/p percutaneous pinning acetabular fx: POD#3 today.
   -- ortho team following
   -- continue oxycodone for pain control, can discontinue IV morphine.
   -- continue post op lovenox, Ca, vit D
   -- PT involved, but goal is to have patient OOB to chair with assist
   today
   .
   # s/p post-op afib: Brief lasting about an hour in the setting of
   getting an albuterol neb. Would avoid inhaled beta agonists. Converted
   back to sinus with 10mg of IV dilt on the floor. Not on any maintenance
   orders and on transfer to the MICU the patient was in sinus rhythm.
   -- avoid albuterol
   -- continue telemetry
   ..
   # Hematuria: from trauma. Urology following. Patient with large scrotal
   hematoma which could be [**2-24**] foley trauma vs unclear procedure in
   suprapubic area.
   -- urology following, appreciate recs. Have urology come and reevaluate
   scrotal hematoma today
   -- continue foley
   -- f/u UA, UCx
   .
   # DM: Hold metformin since he got contrast from CTA.
   -- use insulin sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: BP stable but will continue to hold home losartan

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and a 100-pack year tobacco history. He was admitted with a right acetabular fracture and underwent right acetabular repair on 9/27. The patient experienced post-operative hypoxia and was weaned down from non-rebreather mask to a nasal cannula. He received 5 units of packed red blood cells since surgery and has stable hematocrit levels but has not bumped appropriately. The patient's current vitals include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate ranging from 77 to 164 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/49 to 124/73 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 19 to 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient has bibasilar crackles and moderate air movement, distended and tympanic abdomen, and a large scrotal hematoma with ecchymosis and tension. The patient's lab results show stable hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and normal troponin-T levels. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 91%, indicating potential hypoxia. The differential diagnosis includes post-operative atelectasis, emphysema, pneumonia, and fluid"

   86 y/o M w/type 2 DM, extensive tobacco hx, MGUS, admitted s/p hip
   fracture now with hypoxemia and anemia.  Hypoxemia appears to be
   associated with transfusions but does not appear massively volume
   overloaded on exam.
   1. Hypoxemia:  He still has an impressive oxygen requirement without
   significant findings on lung exam.  Pneumonia seems unlikely given lack
   of infiltrate on CXR, afebrile, & no leukocytosis.  There may be a
   component of volume overload given the transfusions he received.
   Finally, there is a degree of atelectasis likely causing shunt; the
   atelectasis is likely related to his abdominal distention.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes, extensive tobacco use, MGUS, and a recent hip fracture. He was admitted with hypoxemia and anemia. The hypoxemia seems to be associated with transfusions but does not appear to be caused by massive volume overload. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/50 mmHg to 124/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient has been receiving various medications including insulin, antibiotics, and pain management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient still requires a significant amount of oxygen, which may indicate a respiratory issue. Pneumonia seems unlikely due to the lack of infiltrate on the chest X-ray, absence of fever, and no leukocytosis. However, there may be a component of volume overload given the transfusions received, as well as atelectasis related to abdominal distention.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable since admission despite receiving 5 units of blood. There are no signs of hematoma around the hip site, and the scrotum has a hematoma that does not explain the need for 5 units of blood. An abdominal CT scan showed some old blood related to prior trauma.

3. s/p Hip Fracture: The patient's hip fracture is being managed by orthopedics.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved and antihypertensives are being held.

5. Atrial Fibrillation/Supraventricular Tachycardia (AFib/SVT): The patient's heart rhythm has returned to normal sinus rhythm, and albuterol is being held. The patient is currently on diltiazem.

6. Foley Trauma: The patient experienced trauma related to Foley catheterization, and urology is following up. Antibiotics are being continued.

7. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Metformin is being held due to the use of contrast for a CT angiography. Insulin sliding scale is being continued.

ICU Care:
The patient's nutrition is being provided through a diabetic diet. Glycemic control is well-managed using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has an 22-gauge line inserted on September 30th. Prophylaxis measures include low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is being monitored for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

   86 y/o M w/type 2 DM, extensive tobacco hx, MGUS, admitted s/p hip
   fracture now with hypoxemia and anemia.  Hypoxemia appears to be
   associated with transfusions but does not appear massively volume
   overloaded on exam.
   1. Hypoxemia:  He still has an impressive oxygen requirement without
   significant findings on lung exam.  Pneumonia seems unlikely given lack
   of infiltrate on CXR, afebrile, & no leukocytosis.  There may be a
   component of volume overload given the transfusions he received.
   Finally, there is a degree of atelectasis likely causing shunt; the
   atelectasis is likely related to his abdominal distention.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, extensive tobacco use, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. He was admitted after sustaining a hip fracture and is currently experiencing hypoxemia and anemia. The hypoxemia seems to be associated with transfusions but does not appear to be due to massive volume overload on examination. The patient also has a sputum culture showing 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, with 11-17 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high power field.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirement is impressive without significant findings on lung examination. Pneumonia seems unlikely given the lack of infiltrate on chest X-ray, absence of fever, and no leukocytosis. There may be a component of volume overload due to the transfusions received. A degree of atelectasis is likely causing shunt, which is related to the patient's abdominal distention.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is essentially stable since admission despite receiving 5 units of blood. There are no signs of hematoma around the hip site, and the scrotum has a hematoma that does not explain the 5-unit blood requirement. An abdominal CT scan shows some old blood related to prior trauma.

3. s/p hip fracture: The orthopedic team is following up on this issue."

   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-1**], there is again an area of
   opacification at the left base medially with blunting of the
   costophrenic
   angle. Although this could merely reflect atelectatic change, the

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and a 100-pack year tobacco history. He was admitted with a right acetabular fracture and underwent surgery for repair on 9/27. The patient now presents on postoperative day (POD) #4 with several medical complications.

1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to have hypoxia likely due to a combination of post-operative atelectasis, emphysema, and pneumonia (PNA). The presence of gold-coated particles (GPCs) in the sputum suggests an infection. The patient has been weaned down to a shovel mask and is being treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin tailored to the sensitivities of GPCs. Aggressive incentive spirometry and chest physical therapy are recommended to address atelectasis. Ipratropium and a bowel regimen have also been initiated.

2. Delirium: The patient exhibits multifactorial delirium, which includes being elderly, in the ICU, in pain, on narcotics, and having an infection (PNA). Frequent reorientation, minimizing narcotics while maintaining pain control, bowel regimen, treating PNA, and administering zyprexa 2.5 PRN are part of the management plan.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 M with DM and 100-pack year tobacco hx admitted with R acetabular
   fracture now POD#4 s/p R acetabular repair [**9-27**] with post-op hypoxia
   likely [**2-24**] atelectasis and PNA now on NC, also with large scrotal and
   suprapubic hematoma.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient weaned down to 6L NC. Cause of hypoxia
   multifactorial: combination of post-op atelectasis, emphysema, and PNA
   with GPCs in sputum. [**Month (only) 51**] be component of fluid overload s/p transfusion
   of 5units PRBCs since surgery but is autodiuresing
   -- continue vanc/levo for now, tailor to sensitivities and
   specificities for GPCs in sputum
   -- aggressive use of incentive spirometry as CXR showed low lung
   volumes c/w atelectasis
   -- NG tube decompression as CT abd showed ileus, and PO narcan
   -- continue ipratroprium
   .
   # Bowel ileus: Patient with ileus on CT abd/pelvis from yesterday.
   Likely [**2-24**] to narcotics for pain. Fleets enema given with slight
   response but patient
s abdomen still distended and may be adding to
   patient
s hypoxia by decreasing lung volumes. Rectal tube in place.
   -- NGT decompression with NPO for now
   -- PO narcan may help ileus [**2-24**] narcotic use
   -- Fleets enema and bowel reg prn
   .
   # Lethargy: Patient slightly lethargic this AM, likely [**2-24**] narcotics,
   but will follow closely.
   -- wean down from narcotics
   -- CT head and toxic/metabolix w/u if mental status doesn
t improve
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with large pelvic fracture apparently with large
   amount of free fluid on pelvic floor prior to surgery. This is likely
   source of scrotal hematoma but would want to r/o continued bleed as has
   received 5units PRBCs since surgery and Hct has been stable but has not
   bumped appropriately. CT abd/pelvis showed no RP bleed, and decreased
   amount of blood in pelvic floor. Per urology, this blood from known
   fracture and bleed is likely tracking into scrotum but no acute
   intervention.
   -- urology following, appreciate recs.
   -- continue to monitor Hct Q12hr
   .
   #. s/p Hypotension: Resolved. Patient reported to have hypotension to
   SBP 80s on floor. Concern for sepsis however no fever, white count, or
   source for infection. Patient
s BP has remained at baseline between SBP
   110-120s since admission to ICU
   -- continue to hold home losartan
   .
   # s/p percutaneous pinning acetabular fx: POD#4 today. Oxycodone alone
   did not control pain so restarted on IV morphine prn. Some of continued
   anemia may be 2/2 blood from hip and pelvic fractures.
   -- ortho team following
   -- continue oxycodone and morphine for pain control
   -- add standing Tylenol for pain control
   -- continue post op lovenox, Ca, vit D
   -- PT involved, but goal is to have patient OOB to chair with assist
   today
   .
   # s/p post-op afib and SVT: 2 events of tachycardia since operation. No
   history of afib but patient started on PO dilt for rate control
   -- continue diltiazem 30mg PO QID for rate control
   -- avoid albuterol
   -- continue telemetry
   ..
   # Hematuria: from foley trauma. Urology following. Patient with large
   scrotal hematoma which is being followed by urology. UCx no growth
   -- urology following, appreciate recs. Have urology come and reevaluate
   scrotal hematoma today
   -- continue foley
   .
   # DM: Hold metformin since he got contrast from CTA.
   -- use insulin sliding scale
   .
   # HTN: BP stable but will continue to hold home losartan

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and a 100-pack year tobacco history. He was admitted with a right acetabular fracture and underwent surgery for repair. The patient is now on the fourth post-operative day (POD#4) and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely due to a combination of post-operative atelectasis, emphysema, and pneumonia (PNA). The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 95% while using a face tent for oxygen delivery. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not mentioned in the note, but the patient's respiratory support is being continued with incentive spirometry to improve lung volumes and prevent further atelectasis.

2. Bowel ileus: The patient has developed bowel ileus, which is likely caused by the use of narcotics for pain management. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed evidence of ileus, and a rectal tube has been placed to decompress the bowels. The patient received an enema with slight response, but their abdomen remains distended. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help alleviate the ileus.

3. Lethargy: The patient has been slightly lethargic in the morning, possibly due to narcotics. The narcotics will be weaned down, and a"

   fracture now with hypoxemia and anemia.  Hypoxemia appears to be
   associated with transfusions but does not appear massively volume
   overloaded on exam.
   1. Hypoxemia:  Oxygen requirement is improved today.  While we were
   examining him, his O2 was off and SpO2 between 87-91%.  Most likely
   cause is atelectasis causing shunt; the atelectasis is likely related
   to his abdominal distention.

   associated with transfusions but does not appear massively volume
   overloaded on exam.
   1. Hypoxemia:  Oxygen requirement is improved today.  While we were
   examining him, his O2 was off and SpO2 between 87-91%.  Most likely
   cause is atelectasis causing shunt; the atelectasis is likely related
   to his abdominal distention.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hip fracture, hypoxia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, extensive tobacco use, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and currently admitted for a hip fracture. The patient's main issues include hypoxemia, anemia, s/p hip fracture, hypotension, atrial fibrillation/supraventricular tachycardia (AFib/SVT), Foley trauma, diabetes mellitus (DM), and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, which may be caused by atelectasis related to abdominal distention. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues and potentially result in organ damage if not properly managed.

2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, indicated by a decreased hematocrit (Hct) level. If left untreated or unmanaged, it may lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and increased susceptibility to infections.

3. s/p Hip Fracture: The patient had a hip fracture, and the ortho team is following up on this. There is a risk of complications associated with hip fractures, including non-union, malunion, infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE).

4. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension, which has since resolved. However"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hip fracture, type 2 diabetes mellitus, extensive tobacco use, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The patient was admitted for a hip fracture and is now presenting with hypoxemia and anemia. The patient's oxygen requirement has improved, but there were episodes of low oxygen saturation during examination. This could be due to atelectasis causing shunt, possibly related to abdominal distention.

The patient's anemia appears to be stable, and it will be monitored. The hip fracture is being managed by orthopedics. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and antihypertensives are being held. The patient was previously experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/SVT) but is now back in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Albuterol is being held, and the patient is on diltiazem.

There was a Foley trauma, and urology is following up. The patient is continuing with antibiotics as well. The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin sliding scale, and blood sugar levels are well controlled. The patient is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's delirium is likely related to narcotics and ICU environment, and Zyprexa is being used"
