","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, which is suspected to be caused by a COPD flare-up, possible underlying infection, and component of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient required invasive ventilation support and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE). The preliminary read of the CTA showed a possible PE.

The patient's ABG after arriving in the ICU showed improved PCO2 levels at 47, indicating better ventilation. However, the patient remained intubated overnight on assist-control (AC) ventilation mode. After removing sedation, the patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV).

On the current flow sheet, the patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate between 91-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/50-155/91 mmHg, respiratory rate between 21-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with total input and output within normal limits.

The patient is receiving various medications including levofloxacin, solumedrol, azithromycin, and romiplostim. She also has multiple lines including an 18-gauge and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She presented to the ICU due to respiratory failure, which was initially attributed to a COPD flare-up and possible underlying infection. The patient required invasive ventilation and showed improvement in her PCO2 levels overnight. However, after removing sedation, the patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) well. She has been intubated overnight on assist-control (AC) mode. The patient has no known drug allergies and was given Levofloxacin at 08:30 PM on 01/25/2178.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or quantity is essential.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility associated with mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs (DVT) and potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Prophylactic measures like heparin injections should be continued.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels, especially during high-dose steroid treatment. Frequent glucose monitoring and adjustments in insulin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, specifically hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE), which was negative. The patient's initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showed an elevated PCO2 of 47. She tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) after removal of sedation and remains intubated overnight on assist-control (AC) ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for more advanced respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: Although the CTA was negative for PE, there is still a risk of developing a PE due to immobility and other risk factors. Close monitoring for symptoms such as sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemodynamic instability is essential.

3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics, indicating a possible underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and worsening respiratory status, is important.

4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose level"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats (VPB), diabetes mellitus type II, and anxiety.

From the 24-hour events, it is noted that the patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo and an EKG. The patient was unable to tolerate pressure support (PS) and had poor spontaneous breathing efforts. The endotracheal tube was advanced by 2 cm in the morning if the patient remained intubated. Diuresis with lasix was initiated to facilitate weaning. Tube feeds were held after midnight for possible extubation. Bigeminy overnight was checked, and electrolytes were replenished.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 99 bpm (82-102), blood pressure ranging from 127/45-141/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (17-26), and oxygen saturation of 94% on FiO2 of 40%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 687 mL of total fluids, with outputs including 57 mL of TF, 310 mL of IV fluids, and 2,465 mL of urine output. The NG output and stool output are not mentioned"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, DM2, anxiety, and acute respiratory failure who is currently admitted to the ICU. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 127/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on FiO2 40%. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 74 mmHg, and HCO3- of 36 mEq/L. The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats and is being treated with verapamil for hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular premature beats (VPB, VPC, PVC) increases the risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the EKG and prompt treatment with antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion may be necessary.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's high blood glucose levels (271 mg/dL) raise concerns about potential diabetic complications. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and electrolyte imbalances is crucial to prevent or manage DKA/HHS.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and anxiety. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. The patient has been experiencing repeated removal of OG tube and required greater sedation for its replacement. She has also been given Zyprexa 2.5mg and Lasix 40mg IV. The FiO2 was increased due to a PO2 of 57.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with a range of 86-120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/58 mmHg to 154/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 14-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results indicate an increased white blood cell count, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, potassium, and magnesium are within normal range.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient likely has hypercarbic respiratory failure due to COPD and possible flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been diuresed with Lasix and is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials for two hours. She will continue prednis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, anxiety, and ventricular premature beats. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The patient's medical history includes AMS (acute mental status changes) and SOB (shortness of breath). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated CO2 levels indicate a potential complication related to inadequate ventilation or lung function.
2. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's echo showed evidence of diastolic dysfunction, which can contribute to fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema.
3. Infection: The increased WBC count suggests a possible infection, and the patient is already on antibiotics. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a risk for hypotension. Careful monitoring and adjustment of medications, particularly verapamil for hypertension, may be required.
5. Malnutrition: The patient is on tube feeds, but continues to pull out OG and NG tubes, indicating a potential risk for malnutrition and inadequate nutritional support.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids, but there is also evidence of fluid loss through diuresis and urine output. Close monitoring of fluid balance is crucial to prevent dehydration or fluid overload.
7. Sedation: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, esophageal stricture, and aspiration pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and required invasive ventilation. The patient underwent neurosurgery repair for a C5-C6 fracture. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 60%. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 114/53 to 135/67 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 91% on nasal cannula. His fluid balance shows a negative balance of -305 mL. The patient's recent labs indicate an elevated blood glucose level of 400 mg/dL, which was covered with sliding scale insulin. Other labs are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and current respiratory support indicate a risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Ventricular Premature Beats (VPBs/VPC/PVC): The patient's ECG shows ventricular premature beats, which may indicate an underlying cardiac condition.
3. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's elevated blood glucose level suggests poorly controlled diabetes. It is important to monitor and manage his blood glucose levels to prevent further complications.
4. Anxiety: The patient's history of anxiety may contribute to increased stress"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several ongoing medical conditions. The patient's 02 sats range between 88 to low 90s on 3L overnight and they are comfortable. The patient's blood glucose levels were in the 400s after receiving juice, but this has been covered with sliding scale insulin and oral medications will be resumed in the morning. The patient likely has chronic bronchitis and is being treated with Mucinex. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 85 bpm (73-99), blood pressure ranging from 114/53 to 135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (11-29), and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient received fluids totaling 1,280 mL, with 990 mL given orally, 190 mL via intravenous fluids, and total output including urine and blood products totaling 1,585 mL. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 346 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8."

   overload/CHF on a backdrop of COPD.  Patient stable on 2L with
   saturation goal 88-92%.
   - Continue Lasix 20mg IV daily to goal -1L daily while creatinine &
   blood pressure tolerate diuresis.
   - Prednisone 30mg daily to taper on floor
   - Azithromycin 250mg until [**1-31**]
   # AMS: Resolved, likely due to hypercarbia.
   # DM2: RISS, close monitoring while on steroids.
   # HTN: Continue verapamil.  Will hold for hypotension

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and acute myocardial infarction. The patient has shown improvement and is now comfortable after extubation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 114/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 346 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 35 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 60 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention (JVD), regular heart sounds without murmurs, diminished breath sounds without wheezes, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

Laboratory findings show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 13.1 g/dL, blood glucose of 156 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 140 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 4.5 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL, and troponin T level of less than 0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment includes resolution of hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, and acute mental status change. The plan includes continuing Lasix IV to achieve a goal of -1L daily while monitoring creatinine and blood pressure, tapering prednisone on the floor, administering azithromycin until January 31st, and closely monitoring diabetes mellitus type 2 while on steroids. The patient will start a regular diet when extubated and will be replete with electrolytes as needed. Heparin will be administered subcutaneously three times a day, and a proton pump inhibitor along with a bowel regimen will be initiated. The patient's code status is full code, and she has been called out to the floor today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Prolonged intubation and ventilatory support.
2. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility.
4. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to steroid use and critical illness.
5. Hypoglyc"
