 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Shock:  Most likely septic given high initial mixed venous SvO2, fever,
   bandemia suggest infection.  Now with falling ScVo2 evolving
   cardiogenic component
   Plan: switch Neo to Levophed for more inotrop and add Dobutamine if
   this fails to get SCVo2 close to 70
           : run CVP 10-12, check cortisol, HCT above 30,
   Possible sources
    1.  PNA
 will BAL and send for cx
    2.  Endocarditis
 bandemia, back pain, evolving cardiogenic
 check
   Echo
    3.  Urosepsis: + UA, cover, no hydro by abd US
    3. Occult Abd Abscess: too unstable to scan
  nothing on ABd US -
   will try to scan when able
   Other causes of abdominal pain include pancreatitis, cholangitis not
   supported by labs or imaging.
   ARDS: Respiratory failure:  hypoxemic with infiltrates consistent with
   pneumonia evolving ARDS.  Low tidal volume ventilation, wean PEEP and
   FIO2 as possible
   Acute renal failure:  in setting of shock, likely ATN, still urinating
   but acid base status may push for early CVVH. Consult Nephrology.
   Abnormal liver function test:  could be from shock.  Or specific
   infections such as mycoplasma, legionella, underlying hepatitis.
   Met with wife and family x 30 minutes to upodate on critical illness
   and all questions were answered.
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of childhood testicular cancer, hypothyroidism, presenting to the emergency department with back pain and diagnosed with musculoskeletal issues. He returned with fevers. The patient was started on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen insertion. Blood cultures were taken, and an ultrasound was performed. The patient has no known drug allergies. He is sedated and unable to provide history.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/57mmHg to 125/63mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated. Physical examination findings include scleral edema, endotracheal tube in place, bilateral dense rhonchi at the bases, well-healed clamshell scar, distended but soft abdomen, cool hands and feet, no edema, and opens eyes to voice.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine level, low platelet count, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and pneumonia. The plan includes switching from Neo to Levophed for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shock and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of childhood testicular cancer and hypothyroidism. He presented to the emergency department with back pain and was diagnosed with musculoskeletal pain. The patient returned with fevers.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 116/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin), sedatives (fentanyl and midazolam), vasopressin, phenylephrine, famotidine, and others. 

The flow sheet data indicates that the patient has been receiving fluids, and his urine output is within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of childhood testicular cancer, hypothyroidism, and previous diagnosis of MSK. The patient presented to the emergency department with back pain and was diagnosed with musculoskeletal pain. He was discharged but returned with fevers.

The patient's current condition is critical, and he is experiencing shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/57 mmHg to 125/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including EKG, arterial blood culture, urine culture, ultrasound, and various infusions and medications. He is sedated, and therefore unable to provide his own medical history.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are also imbalanced, with low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and pneumonia. He is receiving appropriate ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

   ``
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of childhood testicular cancer, hypothyroidism, and a previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MSK). The patient presented to the emergency department with back pain and was diagnosed with musculoskeletal pain (DC). He returned with fevers.

The patient's current condition indicates that he is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The medical team's assessment includes septic shock with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. Imaging studies reveal infiltrates on chest X-ray consistent with pneumonia evolving into ARDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Organ failure: Due to septic shock and ARDS, the patient is at risk of multiple organ failure, including renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular dysfunction.

2. Infection: Pneumonia is already present, and there is a possibility of developing other infections due to immunosuppression from sepsis and critical illness.

3. Nosocomial infections: As the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections such as ventil"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular
   cancer as a child, p/w back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal
   failure, now in septic shock.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikley PE as a
   bandemia on diff.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as mixed venous
   sat is in the 80s.
   - now s/p intubation
   - wean Fi02 as tolerated
   - ARDS net protocol
   - treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for MRSA,
   peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   .
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Mixed
   venous sat in the 80s which is consistent with this physiology.
   Bandemia and low WBC count also consistent with septic shock.  DDX from
   PNA vs endocarditis (given multifocal PNA) vs osteomyelitis (given back
   pain) vs pancreatitis vs other intra-abdominal process.  Would ideally
   like to get a CT torso to eval for extra-pulmonary source of infection
   but currently too unstable.
   - add-on amylase and lipase to eval for pancreatitis
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox as above.
   - Fluid recusitated as CVP now 16
   - Started phenylephrine and vasopressin w/ goal MAP > 60
   - trend urine output and lactate
   - ECHO to eval for endocarditis w/ daily EKGs
   - CT torso when able
   - check HIV status (consent obtained)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likley pre-renal from dehydration. FENA < 1% and
   cr coming down with IVF.  Unfortunately his UOP has dropped off in the
   setting of hypotension and this could be concerning for ATN.
   - trend UOP
   - will try additional fluid challenge to see if UOP improves
   - Renal consult in am
   - continue to monitor potassium (likely elevated in the setting of
   renal failure and acidemia)
   - renal U/S
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST/ALT trending up since admission.  Does have a
   history of moderate drinking so this could be consistent with alcoholic
   hepatitis.  Could also be from shock liver vs inflammation in the
   setting of infection.
   - check Hep serologies
   - trend for now
   - Abdominal U/S
   .
   # Back pain: R-sided, tender to palpation over R mid-back.  Per his
   wife he has had some intermittent scapular pain for the past 4 months.
   Possibly from PNA vs other etiology.  Must consider malignancy given
   weight loss or possible osteomyelitis.
   - imaging when able
   .
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, hold tube feeds until
   amylase/lipase back
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer as a child, presenting with hypoxia, acute renal failure, and now in septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with severe pneumonia, likely evolving into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other potential diagnoses include endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pancreatitis, or other intra-abdominal processes. The patient's shock is most consistent with septic or distributive shock, and mixed venous saturation in the 80s is consistent with this physiology. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's condition could progress to ARDS due to severe pneumonia, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is currently in septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not managed appropriately.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can worsen if not treated promptly and appropriately.
4. Endocarditis: Given the presence of multifocal pneumonia, there is a concern for endocarditis, which can lead to further complications such as embolic events or heart failure.
5. Osteomyelitis: The patient's back pain and weight loss raise concerns for osteomyelitis, which can lead to systemic infection and possible spread to other organs.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular
   cancer as a child, p/w back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal
   failure, now in septic shock.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as mixed venous
   sat is in the 80s.
   - now s/p intubation, on AC currently, will attempt to wean ventilation
   as tolerated
   - ARDS net protocol
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
   MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   .
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Mixed
   venous sat yesterday in the 80s which was consistent with septic shock,
   however dropped to 40
s later in the day, more consistent with
   cardiogenic shock.  The patient was switched from vasopressin to
   levophed.  Bandemia and low WBC count also consistent with septic
   shock.  DDX from PNA vs endocarditis (given multifocal PNA) vs
   osteomyelitis (given back pain) vs pancreatitis vs other
   intra-abdominal process.  Would ideally like to get a CT torso to eval
   for extra-pulmonary source of infection but currently too unstable.
   - add-on amylase and lipase to eval for pancreatitis
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox as above.
   - Fluid recusitated as CVP now 16
   - Started phenylephrine and vasopressin w/ goal MAP > 60
   - trend urine output and lactate
   - ECHO to eval for endocarditis w/ daily EKGs
   - CT torso when able
   - check HIV status (consent obtained)
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likley pre-renal from dehydration. FENA < 1% and
   cr coming down with IVF.  Unfortunately his UOP has dropped off in the
   setting of hypotension and this could be concerning for ATN.
   - trend UOP
   - will try additional fluid challenge to see if UOP improves
   - Renal consult in am
   - continue to monitor potassium (likely elevated in the setting of
   renal failure and acidemia)
   - renal U/S
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST/ALT trending up since admission.  Does have a
   history of moderate drinking so this could be consistent with alcoholic
   hepatitis.  Could also be from shock liver vs inflammation in the
   setting of infection.
   - check Hep serologies
   - trend for now
   - Abdominal U/S
   .
   # Back pain: R-sided, tender to palpation over R mid-back.  Per his
   wife he has had some intermittent scapular pain for the past 4 months.
   Possibly from PNA vs other etiology.  Must consider malignancy given
   weight loss or possible osteomyelitis.
   - imaging when able
   .
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, hold tube feeds until
   amylase/lipase back
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer, presenting with hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is consistent with multifocal pneumonia and evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are concerns about potential endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pancreatitis, or other intra-abdominal processes. The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance is disturbed, with a central mixed venous oxygen saturation of 46, indicating poor tissue perfusion. There are also signs of transaminitis and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to ARDS and multifocal pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Septic shock: The patient's shock status requires close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics and fluid resuscitation is necessary to manage sepsis and prevent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function needs careful monitoring, and daily assessment of serum creatinine and urine output is essential. Adequate fluid management and consideration for renal replacement therapy may be required.
4. Pneumonia and ARDS: Frequent chest X-rays and arterial blood gas analysis are needed"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular
   cancer as a child, p/w back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal
   failure, now in septic shock.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as mixed venous
   sat is in the 80s.
   - now s/p intubation, on AC currently, will attempt to wean ventilation
   as tolerated
   - ARDS net protocol currently, but attempt to wean
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
   MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   .
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Mixed
   venous sat yesterday in the 80s which was consistent with septic shock,
   however dropped to 40
s later in the day, more consistent with
   cardiogenic shock.  The patient was switched from vasopressin to
   levophed.  Bandemia and low WBC count also consistent with septic
   shock.  Unclear etiology, however may be secondary to bilateral
   pneumonia or intraabdominal process, no evidence of pancreatitis or
   endocarditis
   - will get CT chest/abd/pelvis today
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above.
   - Fluid [**Last Name (LF) 4747**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue to monitor CVP, currently at 10
   - Started phenylephrine and vasopressin w/ goal MAP > 60, then switched
   to norepinephrine currently on 0.18mcg/kg
   - trend urine output and lactate, both stable
   - as improving will discontinue hydrocortisone today.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likley pre-renal from dehydration. FENA < 1% and
   cr coming down with IVF.  UOP stable, continue to trend.
   - continue fluid resuscitation
   - Follow renal recs
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, as responded to fluids this AM
   - will continue to monitor closely
   .
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - Hep serologies pending
   - trend for now
   .
   # Back pain: R-sided, tender to palpation over R mid-back.  Per his
   wife he has had some intermittent scapular pain for the past 4 months.
   Possibly from PNA vs other etiology.  Must consider malignancy given
   weight loss or possible osteomyelitis.
   - will get CT chest, Abd, pelvis today
   .
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, hold tube feeds until
   amylase/lipase back
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a significant medical history of testicular cancer as a child. He presented with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and is now in septic shock. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/53-125/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450-500 mL and respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute. The patient's physical examination reveals a clear oropharynx, supple neck, no jugular venous distention, clear lung sounds bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities with well-perfused pulses, and no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Laboratory findings show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16,100 cells/µL, elevated lactate level of 3.2 mmol/L, elevated lactic acid level of 19 mmol/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 46 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 2."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing septic shock. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, low blood pressure, and tachycardia. The physical examination reveals scleral edema, ETT OGT (endotracheal tube in place), and dense rhonchi at the bases of the lungs. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a normal pH, low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and high partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2).

The assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and potential sources such as PNA (pneumonia), endocarditis, urosepsis, and occult abdominal/pelvic abscess. The patient is also at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is receiving low tidal volume ventilation. 

Possible complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis and septic shock, progression of ARDS leading to respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, and potential development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock. The patient has been receiving aggressive IV fluids and is on multiple antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/54 to 125/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is trending up, indicating improved oxygen delivery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated (2.5 mg/dL), indicating possible acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be necessary.

2. Respiratory Complications: Mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current PEEP level is set at 5 cmH2O, which is relatively low. Adjustments to PEEP may be required based on the patient's oxygenation and respiratory parameters. Additionally, regular assessment for signs of ventilator-associated complications, such as ventilator-induced lung injury, should be conducted.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show electrolyte imbalances, including hyponatremia (sodium level of 108 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (potassium level of 7.2 K/uL), and hypocalcemia (calcium level of 7.8 mg/dL). Monitoring and correction of these imbalances are essential to maintain the patient's overall stability.

4. Infection: Despite being on multiple antibiotics, the patient still shows signs of infection, as indicated by elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Cultures should be repeated, and antibiotic therapy may need to be adjusted based on the results.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient's prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated, suggesting a coagulopathy. Close monitoring of clotting parameters and consideration of blood product transfusions may be necessary to prevent or manage bleeding complications.

6. Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction: The patient remains critically ill with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. Continued aggressive management, including source control, hemodynamic support, and organ-specific interventions, is crucial to improve the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is septic shock, and they have been admitted to the ICU.

The patient has been receiving aggressive IVF (intravenous fluids), antibiotics, and vasoactive medications such as norepinephrine. Their vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 99/54 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 81 bpm, and a slightly elevated respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is stable at 97% on supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema, endotracheal tube obstruction, bibasilar dense rhonchi, a well-healed clamshell scar, distended but soft abdomen, cool hands and feet without edema, and opens eyes to voice.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and possible sources such as PNA (pulmonary), endocarditis, urosepsis, or occult abdominal/pelvic abscess. The patient is also at risk for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and early"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with septic shock. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.4°C, current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 81 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 99/54 mmHg to 82/43 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is trending up.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Clindamycin. They are also receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), and norepinephrine.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates that they have received a significant amount of fluids since midnight, with a total input of 6,930 mL and an output of 741 mL. Their urine output is 686 mL, NG output is 55 mL, and stool output is not recorded. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, with set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 29 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 250 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema, ETT oral gastric tube (OGT), bilateral dense rhonchi at bases, a well-healed clamshell scar, distended but soft abdomen, cool hands and feet without edema, and opens eyes to voice. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.3 g/dL, sodium (Na+) of 108 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.9 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) of 2.5 mg/dL, blood glucose of 87 mg/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 266 K/uL, total bilirubin (T Bili) of 1.3 mg/dL, lactate of 3"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular
   cancer as a child, p/w back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal
   failure, now in septic shock.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as mixed venous
   sat is in the 80s.
   - now s/p intubation, on AC currently, will attempt to wean ventilation
   as tolerated
   - ARDS net protocol currently, but attempt to wean
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
   MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   .
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Mixed
   venous sat yesterday in the 80s which was consistent with septic shock,
   however dropped to 40
s later in the day, more consistent with
   cardiogenic shock.  The patient was switched from vasopressin to
   levophed.  Bandemia and low WBC count also consistent with septic
   shock.  Unclear etiology, however may be secondary to bilateral
   pneumonia or intraabdominal process, no evidence of pancreatitis or
   endocarditis
   - will get CT chest/abd/pelvis today
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above.
   - Fluid [**Last Name (LF) 4747**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue to monitor CVP, currently at 10
   - Started phenylephrine and vasopressin w/ goal MAP > 60, then switched
   to norepinephrine currently on 0.18mcg/kg
   - trend urine output and lactate, both stable
   - as improving will discontinue hydrocortisone today.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likley pre-renal from dehydration. FENA < 1% and
   cr coming down with IVF.  UOP stable, continue to trend.
   - continue fluid resuscitation
   - Follow renal recs
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, as responded to fluids this AM
   - will continue to monitor closely
   .
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - Hep serologies pending
   - trend for now
   .
   # Back pain: R-sided, tender to palpation over R mid-back.  Per his
   wife he has had some intermittent scapular pain for the past 4 months.
   Possibly from PNA vs other etiology.  Must consider malignancy given
   weight loss or possible osteomyelitis.
   - will get CT chest, Abd, pelvis today
   .
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, hold tube feeds until
   amylase/lipase back
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer, presenting with back pain and found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypical organisms. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 100/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 37.2°C. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 7.2 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 108,000/mm³, elevated creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 117 mEq/L. The patient's chest X-ray reveals large bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis. The patient is being treated for several conditions including hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, transaminitis, back pain, hypothyroidism, hyperglycemia, and potential deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular
   cancer as a child, p/w back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal
   failure, now in septic shock.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as mixed venous
   sat is in the 80s.
   - now s/p intubation, on AC currently, will attempt to wean ventilation
   as tolerated
   - ARDS net protocol currently, but attempt to wean
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
   MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   .
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Mixed
   venous sat yesterday in the 80s which was consistent with septic shock,
   however dropped to 40
s later in the day, more consistent with
   cardiogenic shock.  The patient was switched from vasopressin to
   levophed.  Bandemia and low WBC count also consistent with septic
   shock.  Unclear etiology, however may be secondary to bilateral
   pneumonia or intraabdominal process, no evidence of pancreatitis or
   endocarditis
   - will get CT chest/abd/pelvis today
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above.
   - Fluid [**Last Name (LF) 4747**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue to monitor CVP, currently at 10
   - Started phenylephrine and vasopressin w/ goal MAP > 60, then switched
   to norepinephrine currently on 0.18mcg/kg
   - trend urine output and lactate, both stable
   - as improving will discontinue hydrocortisone today.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likley pre-renal from dehydration. FENA < 1% and
   cr coming down with IVF.  UOP stable, continue to trend.
   - continue fluid resuscitation
   - Follow renal recs
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, as responded to fluids this AM
   - will continue to monitor closely
   .
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - Hep serologies pending
   - trend for now
   .
   # Back pain: R-sided, tender to palpation over R mid-back.  Per his
   wife he has had some intermittent scapular pain for the past 4 months.
   Possibly from PNA vs other etiology.  Must consider malignancy given
   weight loss or possible osteomyelitis.
   - will get CT chest, Abd, pelvis today
   .
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, hold tube feeds until
   amylase/lipase back
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**]

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is a 41-year-old male with a past medical history of testicular cancer as a child.
- He presented with back pain and was found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
- He is being treated for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn, Levofloxacin) and also for septic shock with vasopressors.
- The patient's condition is complicated by acute renal failure, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, hyperglycemia, and possible malignancy or osteomyelitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to further deterioration in lung function, leading to increased difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock could worsen, resulting in persistent hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels may continue to be low, leading to neurological complications if not corrected appropriately.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes may further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics since admission, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), levofloxacin, and clindamycin. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set Vt of 350 mL, RR of 32, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous RR of 0. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 100/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 11 mmHg, CO/CI (Fick) of (3.9 L/min) / (2.6 L/min/m2), and mixed venous O2% Sat of 64%. The patient's fluid balance indicates an input of 6,796 mL and output of 1,217 mL, resulting in a balance of 5,579 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an endotracheal tube, and the ABG results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 28 mmHg, HCO3- of 17 mEq/L, and SpO2 of 100%. Physical examination findings include distended gallbladder, large bilateral pleural effusions, and atelectasis seen on CT scan. Laboratory results reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 79 K/uL, hyponatremia with a Na+ level of 106 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a K+ level of 4.1 mEq/L, hypocalcemia with a Ca++ level of 7.6 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L. The patient's BAL gram stain shows 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and the respiratory culture shows no growth. The patient's fungal and acid-fast smears are negative. The patient's previous CT scans show no intra-abdominal abscess but do reveal large bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis. The patient's WBC count has fluctuated between 7.2 and 10.6 K/uL, Hct has decreased from 32.1% to 28.3%, and Plt count has been relatively stable between 108 and 79 K/uL. The patient's renal function tests indicate elevated creatinine levels from 2.5 to 3.4 mg/dL. The patient's assessment includes electrolyte & fluid disorder, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and pneumonia. The patient is receiving ICU care with mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and multiple medications for sepsis management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular
   cancer as a child, p/w back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal
   failure, now in septic shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as mixed venous
   sat is in the 80s.
   - now s/p intubation, on CMV
   - - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover
   for MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin &
   Clindamycin for aspiration
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   - Decrease PEEP to 10
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis given CT findings. Continued on levophed. Urine output
   decreasing with evidence of third spacing.
   - will get CT chest/abd/pelvis today
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (adjust
   vanc per troughs)
   - Abdominal U/S today
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy per IR today
   - Continue transfusion for hct >30 given renal ischemia
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN given poor response to fluid
   hydration.
   - continue fluid resuscitation for hemodynamic stability.
   - Follow renal recs
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TPN given pending perc chole
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**]

   I had a 60 min family meeting with wife and also spoke on phone with
   her sister (anesthesiologist). All ?s answered and course reviewed to
   date.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing septic shock and respiratory failure. The note mentions several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, and chloride levels, indicating an electrolyte disorder. There is also evidence of fluid overload as shown by the positive fluid balance.

2. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from severe sepsis due to the presence of fever, bandemia (increased number of bands on a blood differential), and organ dysfunction.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may be a result of sepsis or other underlying conditions.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure with infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. This could be the primary source of infection leading to sepsis.

5. Endocarditis: The presence of bandemia and back pain raises the possibility of endocarditis, another potential source of infection.

6. Urosepsis: The patient's urine analysis indicates the presence of urinary tract infection, which could be contributing to the septic state.

7. Occult abdominal abscess: A CT scan revealed a large gallbladder, suggesting the possibility of an abdominal abscess as another potential source of infection.

8. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure is progressing towards ARDS, characterized by"

- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 34 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and others.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, elevated potassium and magnesium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient has a history of pneumonia, renal failure, and possible endocarditis or urosepsis.
- The patient's condition is critical, and they are currently receiving ICU care with multiple interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Further deterioration of respiratory function: The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation may lead to worsening lung function and potentially develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Progression of seps"

   Patient is critically ill
   I had a 60 min family meeting with wife and also spoke on phone with
   her sister (anesthesiologist). All ?s answered and course reviewed to
   date.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pneumonia, and there are concerns about possible endocarditis or urosepsis as potential sources of infection. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN, and abnormal liver function tests, which may be related to shock. There are also indications of evolving ARDS, with hypoxemic respiratory failure and infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, progression of ARDS, and development of additional organ dysfunctions. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and response to treatments. The patient's respiratory support should be optimized, and there should be ongoing efforts to identify and address the underlying sources of infection. Frequent assessments of renal function and acid-base status are necessary, and discussions regarding early CVVH should be pursued. Close monitoring of liver function and ongoing nutritional support are also important considerations."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and severe organ dysfunction. The patient's medical history includes pneumonia and acute renal failure. The patient has been receiving multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, famotidine (Pepcid), and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/50-105/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. The patient's electrolyte levels are also imbalanced. The physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to the patient's critical condition.

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis and ongoing infection risk can lead to further deterioration of organ function and potential septic shock.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's severe organ dysfunction may progress, affecting other vital organs such as the liver, heart, or lungs.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's existing acute renal failure could worsen, leading to a decrease"

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may
   be contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, no plan to wean
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
   MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin &
   Clindamycin for aspiration
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   - Decrease PEEP to 8
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis given CT findings. Continued on levophed. Urine output
   decreasing with evidence of third spacing.
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (adjust
   vanc per troughs)
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy denied by IR will follow recs
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely secondary to worsening renal failure
   given Lactate normal
   - will likely undergo CVVH today
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN given poor response to fluid
   hydration.
   - Will likely require CVVH today for volume removal given decrease in
   urine output.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Likely secondary to either
   medication effect or from overwhelming infection
   - consult heme/onc today
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a significant medical history of testicular cancer as a child. He presented with back pain and was found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and is currently in septic shock of unclear etiology.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated on CMV (continuous mandatory ventilation) and there is no plan to wean. He has evidence of pleural effusions, which may be contributing to respiratory failure. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypical organisms.
2. Shock: The patient is most likely experiencing septic or distributive shock, possibly secondary to cholecystitis given the CT findings. Levophed (norepinephrine) has been continued, and urine output is decreasing with evidence of third spacing. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and percutaneous cholecystostomy, which was denied by the IR (Interventional Radiology).
3. Metabolic acidosis: This is likely secondary to worsening renal failure given normal lactate levels. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is planned for today for volume removal due to decreased urine output.
4. Acute renal failure: This is likely ATN (acute tubular necrosis) given the poor response to fluid hydration. CVVH is also planned for today"

   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as mixed venous
   sat is in the 80s.
   - now s/p intubation, on CMV
   - - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover
   for MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin &
   Clindamycin for aspiration
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   - Decrease PEEP to 10
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis given CT findings. Continued on levophed. Urine output
   decreasing with evidence of third spacing.
   - will get CT chest/abd/pelvis today
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (adjust
   vanc per troughs)
   - Abdominal U/S today
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy per IR today
   - Continue transfusion for hct >30 given renal ischemia
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN given poor response to fluid
   hydration.
   - continue fluid resuscitation for hemodynamic stability.
   - Follow renal recs
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer in childhood, currently experiencing back pain and hypoxia. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, septic shock of unclear etiology, and pneumonia. The patient is sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypical pathogens. The patient's urine output is decreasing, suggesting third spacing, and he is showing signs of hypotension. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is planned for today. An abdominal ultrasound and percutaneous cholecystostomy are also scheduled. The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a risk for further respiratory compromise.
2. Septic shock: The patient's condition suggests a severe infection leading to systemic inflammation and shock. There is a risk of organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory symptoms and increase the risk of sepsis.
5. Cholecystitis: The CT findings suggest gallbladder inflammation, which could contribute to the patient's shock state and potential"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer as a child. He is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications. 

The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. However, it is mentioned that he is experiencing hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. 

The patient has a significant medical history of testicular cancer during childhood. His current symptoms include back pain, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is sedated and intubated, with sclera anicteric, normal heart sounds, clear lungs, tense abdomen, hypoactive bowel sounds, cool extremities with 2+ pulses, and edema of upper and lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal electrolytes (hypokalemia, hypercalcemia), and elevated creatinine levels. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's imaging studies reveal large bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis on a CT scan, which may contribute to his respiratory failure. 

The assessment and plan include several diagnoses: electrolyte and fluid disorder, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and pneumonia. The treatment plan involves broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypical pathogens, as well as sedation with fentanyl/midazolam, decreased PEEP to 8, and continuation of mechanical ventilation. 

Other interventions include the use of vasopressors (norepinephrine) for shock, consideration of percutaneous cholecystostomy for cholecystitis, continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute renal failure, consultation with hematology/oncology for thrombocytopenia, and empirical thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism. 

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires intensive care management for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome."

   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and evolving ARDS.  Unlikely PE as a
   bandemia on diff.  Unlikely cardiogenic pulmonary edema as mixed venous
   sat is in the 80s.
   - now s/p intubation, on CMV
   - - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover
   for MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin &
   Clindamycin for aspiration
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   - Decrease PEEP to 10
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis given CT findings. Continued on levophed. Urine output
   decreasing with evidence of third spacing.
   - will get CT chest/abd/pelvis today
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (adjust
   vanc per troughs)
   - Abdominal U/S today
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy per IR today
   - Continue transfusion for hct >30 given renal ischemia
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN given poor response to fluid
   hydration.
   - continue fluid resuscitation for hemodynamic stability.
   - Follow renal recs
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving
   - will continue to monitor closely

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer, presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The initial assessment suggests that the patient may have pneumonia with evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's shock is consistent with septic or distributive shock, possibly due to cholecystitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypical organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Septic shock: The patient's condition can rapidly deteriorate if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management of fluid and medication administration are crucial.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and further interventions such as dialysis may be required if the condition worsens.
4. Pneumonia: The patient may develop complications related to pneumonia, such as worsening lung infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Regular chest X-rays and sputum cultures should be performed to monitor progress and guide treatment.
5. Cholecystitis: The patient's symptoms and CT findings suggest possible cholecystitis."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is sepsis, and they have been experiencing progressive metabolic acidosis. The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy, and there are concerns about potential ARDS. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Organ dysfunction: The patient is already showing signs of organ dysfunction with sepsis affecting multiple organ systems such as the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of progression to AKI or end-stage renal disease.
4. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors suggest ongoing septic shock, which carries a high risk of mortality.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
6. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing other nosocomial infections."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with several potential medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the following conditions can be identified:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a severe infection that can lead to organ dysfunction. The presence of fever, bandemia, and organ dysfunction suggest an ongoing systemic inflammatory response.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels and a decrease in urine output. ARF can be a consequence of sepsis and may require urgent management, such as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or hemodialysis.

3. Pneumonia: The patient exhibits signs of respiratory failure, including hypoxemia and infiltrates on imaging consistent with severe pulmonary edema. This could indicate pneumonia, which may require aggressive respiratory support and antibiotic therapy.

4. Abdominal Infections: There are suspicions of abdominal infections, possibly originating from biliary sepsis or urosepsis. Further diagnostic workup, such as follow-up BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage), tapping effusions, and additional imaging studies, may be necessary to identify the source of infection.

5. Occult Abdominal Abscess/Mass: The presence of an occult abdominal abscess or mass has been considered, despite normal imaging results. An endoscopic evaluation may be needed at a later stage to further investigate this possibility."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing sepsis with organ dysfunction. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock given the high initial mixed venous SvO2, fever, bandemia, and signs of infection. There is also evidence of a mixed picture with an EF of 35% and massive volume overload, suggesting likely fluid overload. Repeat ScVo2 if low, and consider starting CVVH to help manage volume overload.

2. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. In the setting of shock, it is likely ATN (acute tubular necrosis). Early CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) may be considered to manage renal failure.

3. Pneumonia, other: The patient has respiratory failure with hypoxemia and infiltrates consistent with severe pulmonary edema. Low tidal volume ventilation should be continued, and efforts should be made to wean PEEP and FiO2 as possible. The restrictive chest wall defect due to previous chest surgery should also be considered.

4. Abnormal liver function tests: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock. Hep serologies are negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of
   pleural effusions, may be contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, no plan to wean, however will check esophageal
   balloon pressure today and adjust vent settings accordingly
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
   MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin &
   Clindamycin for aspiration
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz, can use boluses for dysynchrony
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.
   Continued on levophed.  Requiring CVVH with increase in levophed while
   fluid removal
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (adjust
   vanc per troughs)
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy denied by IR will follow recs
   - consider thoracentesis in the future, however futility unclear
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely secondary to worsening renal failure
   given Lactate normal
   - Improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes and increased RR
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN
   - Continue CVVH for volume removal given decrease in urine output and
   very significant anasarca
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Likely secondary to either
   medication effect or from overwhelming infection
   - Follow heme/recs
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TPN, given evidence of ileus
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**] will likely
   replace to radial today

- The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child, presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology.
- The patient is currently intubated on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode, with no plan to wean off. Sedation is being maintained with fentanyl/midazolam.
- The patient has evidence of pleural effusions contributing to respiratory failure, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover for MRSA, pseudomonas, and atypical pathogens.
- The patient is in septic or distributive shock, possibly secondary to cholecystitis or pleural effusions, with ongoing fluid removal through continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
- The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to worsening renal failure, with lactate levels normalizing.
- Acute renal failure is suspected to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and CVVH is being continued for volume removal.
- Thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology is present, and the patient has hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia.
- Prophylactic measures include total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to evidence of ileus, pneumoboots, and replacement of arterial lines.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer, presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient has evidence of pleural effusions and is intubated on CMV, with no plan to wean. The patient is being treated for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover MRSA, Pseudomonas, and atypical organisms. The patient is also sedated with fentanyl/midazolam and has a decreasing PEEP setting of 8. The patient's urine output is decreasing, suggesting third spacing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to multifocal pneumonia and evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are signs of pleural effusions contributing to respiratory failure.
2. Shock: The patient most likely has septic or distributive shock, possibly secondary to cholecystitis based on CT findings. Levophed is being used to manage the shock, and the patient's urine output is decreasing with evidence of third spacing.

   - CVVH line placed, CVVH started, patient tolerating well while
   remaining even with I/O's, levophed able to be weaned down to .1
   - Increased sedation parameters of versed and fentanyl given patient
   breathing much above the vent with dysynchronous breathing as well as
   patient grimacing frequently.  RT recommended starting pressure
   control, was started at inspiratory pressure of 36, PEEP 8 and R 28
   with the same FiO2.  However, patient had increased Vt up to 700 on
   these settings, so decided to put back on low Vt settings.  ABG at that
   point showed worsening acidosis and hypercapnia.
   - Pt found to have platelets of 47 with gum bleeding and hematuria.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU for septic shock, severe pneumonia, acute renal failure, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's condition has been unstable, with worsening acidosis and hypercapnia. He is on mechanical ventilation with increased tidal volume (Vt) settings, but this led to worsening ABG results. His platelet count is low, with gum bleeding and hematuria. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics and sedatives. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening septic shock: The patient's condition indicates ongoing infection and systemic inflammation, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The presence of severe pneumonia and worsening ABG results suggest a high risk for ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure requires close monitoring of renal function and timely intervention to prevent further deterioration.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and bleeding manifestations indicate a potential coagulopathy that needs to be managed with appropriate blood product transfusion and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology seems most
   consistent with multifocal PNA and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of
   pleural effusions, may be contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, no plan to wean, however will check esophageal
   balloon pressure today and adjust vent settings accordingly
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
   MRSA, peusdomonas and atypicals w/ Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin &
   Clindamycin for aspiration
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz, can use boluses for dysynchrony
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.
   Continued on levophed.  Requiring CVVH with increase in levophed while
   fluid removal
   - Cover broadly with vanc/zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (adjust
   vanc per troughs)
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy denied by IR will follow recs
   - consider thoracentesis in the future, however futility unclear
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely secondary to worsening renal failure
   given Lactate normal
   - Improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes and increased RR
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN
   - Continue CVVH for volume removal given decrease in urine output and
   very significant anasarca
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Likely secondary to either
   medication effect or from overwhelming infection
   - Follow heme/recs
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TPN, given evidence of ileus
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**] will likely
   replace to radial today

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child, currently presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, which may be contributing to respiratory failure. The patient is intubated on CMV mode, with no plan to wean, and will continue to treat for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Shock: The patient is most consistent with septic or distributive shock, possibly due to cholecystitis or pleural effusions. Continued CVVH with fluid removal is recommended.
3. Metabolic acidosis: This is likely secondary to worsening renal failure. CVVH and low tidal volumes are helping to improve the condition.
4. Acute renal failure: ATN is likely, and CVVH for volume removal is recommended. Following renal recommendations is advised.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology, but could be secondary to medication effect or overwhelming infection. Following heme/recs is recommended.
6. Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic, but resolving. Close monitoring is advised.
7. Transaminitis: Secondary to shock liver or viral process. Trending for now, and considering sending viral loads.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, no plan to wean, however will maintain vent
   settings consistent with ARDS net including decreased Vt and increased
   PEEP
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics Zosyn,
   Levofloxacin & Clindamycin
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz, can use boluses for dysynchrony, with
   less trouble with dysynchrony today
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.
   Continued on levophed.  Requiring CVVH with increase in levophed while
   fluid removal
   - Cover broadly with zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (vanc
   discontinued per ID yesterday)
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy denied by IR will follow recs
   - consider thoracentesis in the future, however futility unclear
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check [**Doctor First Name **] now, however likelihood of rheumatologic condition
   causing acute presentation of distributive shock very unlikely
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely secondary to worsening renal failure
   given Lactate normal
   - Improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes and increased RR
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN
   - Continue CVVH for volume removal given decrease in urine output and
   very significant anasarca
   - Goal of 100cc of fluid removal per hour by CVVH, will attempt to
   concentrate medications
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Improving.  Likely secondary
   to either medication effect or from overwhelming infection
   - Follow heme/recs
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per CVVH and TPN
   orders
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TPN, given evidence of ileus
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child, currently admitted for back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a diagnosis of hypoxic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the source of sepsis is still being investigated. The patient is also experiencing shock, likely septic or distributive, possibly secondary to cholecystitis or pleural effusions. Other conditions include metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (likely acute tubular necrosis), thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for fluid removal and medication concentration, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to evidence of ileus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of multi-drug resistant infections, further deterioration of renal function, complications related to the use of CVVH, and potential for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuating vital signs and ongoing respiratory support.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's temperature has been within normal range, but there has been a slight increase in heart rate. Blood pressure has been relatively stable, with some variations. Respiratory rate has remained within normal limits, and oxygen saturation has been consistently above 99%.

The patient's arterial line was placed yesterday evening, and cultures were obtained from the femoral arterial line and right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter. Additionally, a urine culture was collected.

The patient's fluid balance has shown a significant input of fluids, with a total input of 7,782 mL and an output of 7,888 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 106 mL. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within the normal range at 12 mmHg.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, calcium gluconate, and potassium chloride as part of CRRT. Other medications include levofloxacin, vancomycin, clindamycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin ("

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, no plan to wean, however will maintain vent
   settings consistent with ARDS net including decreased Vt and increased
   PEEP
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics Zosyn,
   Levofloxacin & Clindamycin
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz, can use boluses for dysynchrony, with
   less trouble with dysynchrony today
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.
   Continued on levophed.  Requiring CVVH with increase in levophed while
   fluid removal
   - Cover broadly with zosyn/levoflox/clindamycin as above (vanc
   discontinued per ID yesterday)
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy denied by IR will follow recs
   - consider thoracentesis in the future, however futility unclear
   - appreciate ID recs
   - will check [**Doctor First Name **] now, however likelihood of rheumatologic condition
   causing acute presentation of distributive shock very unlikely
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely secondary to worsening renal failure
   given Lactate normal
   - Improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes and increased RR
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN
   - Continue CVVH for volume removal given decrease in urine output and
   very significant anasarca
   - Goal of 100cc of fluid removal per hour by CVVH, will attempt to
   concentrate medications
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Improving.  Likely secondary
   to either medication effect or from overwhelming infection
   - Follow heme/recs
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per CVVH and TPN
   orders
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TPN, given evidence of ileus
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**] replaced with
   radial line on [**2139-12-21**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer, presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is being treated for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient is in septic shock, most likely due to cholecystitis or pleural effusions, and is being managed with continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and vasopressor support. He has metabolic acidosis secondary to worsening renal failure, acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia. The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to ileus. The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and other complications are being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued septic shock with organ dysfunction.
2. Progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Worsening acute renal failure and need for ongoing renal support.
4. Thrombocytopenia and potential bleeding complications.
5. Metabolic acidosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, no plan to wean, however will maintain vent
   settings consistent with ARDS net including decreased Vt and increased
   PEEP, will ask respiratory today to work with vent settings to attempt
   to adjust to make patient more comfortable if possible.
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics Zosyn and
   Levofloxacin
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz, can use boluses for dysynchrony
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.
   Continued on levophed.  Requiring CVVH with increase in levophed while
   fluid removal
   - Cover broadly tapering down antibiotics per ID, with discontinuing
   clindamycin today given low likelihood of toxic shock, but will
   continue zosyn and levoflox for now
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy denied by IR will follow recs
   - consider thoracentesis in the future, however futility unclear
   - appreciate ID recs
   - [**Doctor First Name **] negative
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes and increased RR
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN
   - Continue CVVH for volume removal given decrease in urine output, very
   significant anasarca and continuing to require pressors
   - Goal of 100cc of fluid removal per hour by CVVH, will attempt to
   concentrate medications, diuresed approx 3 L yesterday
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Improving now that the
   patient is off vancomycin.  Likely secondary to either medication
   effect or from overwhelming infection
   -          Follow heme/recs
   -          Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per CVVH and TPN
   orders
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TPN, given evidence of ileus
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer who presented with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with decreased tidal volume and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain oxygenation.

The patient's shock is most consistent with septic or distributive shock, possibly due to cholecystitis or pleural effusions. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) to remove fluid and correct metabolic abnormalities.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, which is improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes. He has acute renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is undergoing CVVH for fluid removal. The goal is to remove 100 cc of fluid per hour.

Thrombocytopenia is present, but its etiology is unclear. It may be related to medication effects or overwhelming infection. The patient's hyponatremia is likely hypovolemic and resolving with CVVH and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). His transaminitis is likely secondary to shock liver or viral process.

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, respiratory to work with vent settings to optimize
   performance
   - continue levo/zosyn
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz, can use boluses for dysynchrony
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.
   Continued on levophed.  Requiring CVVH with increase in levophed while
   fluid removal
   - Cover broadly tapering down antibiotics per ID on [**Last Name (un) **]/zosyn
   - appreciate ID recs
   -overall improved and weaned off pressors overnight
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes and increased RR, will
   attempt to increase PS to decrease RR
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, impoved
   - Continue CVVH for volume removal given decrease in urine output, very
   significant anasarca and continuing to require pressors, will discuss
   with renal the possibility of stopping CVVH and progressing to HD
   - Will decrease amount of fluid removed with CVVH in attempt to
   increase UOP
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Improving now that the
   patient is off vancomycin.  Likely secondary to either medication
   effect or from overwhelming infection
   -          Follow heme/recs
   -          Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per CVVH and
   begin TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer as a child, presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, contributing to respiratory failure, and is intubated on CMV with respiratory support. He is also receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause, such as pleural effusions, is not addressed.
2. Shock: The patient is at risk of further deterioration in organ perfusion and function if the cause of septic shock is not identified and treated promptly.
3. Metabolic acidosis: Although the patient's metabolic acidosis has improved, it can recur if there is inadequate tissue perfusion or ongoing renal dysfunction.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient may experience worsening renal function if the current therapy (CVVH) is not effective or if other complications arise.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may continue to be a concern, and monitoring for bleeding complications is essential.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels may continue to be a concern, particularly if fluid balance is not managed appropriately during CVVH.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzyme levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and pneumonia. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in oxygenation and ventilation parameters. He has also been receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged stay on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture results will be necessary to prevent and identify this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and early ambulation should be implemented.
3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the ongoing infection and immunosuppressive treatments, making him susceptible to nosocomial infections. Frequent monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and adherence to strict sterile practices are essential in preventing these infections.
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: Due to renal failure, the patient may experience difficulties in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output, as well as regular electrolyte tests, will"

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, no plan to wean, however will maintain vent
   settings consistent with ARDS net including decreased Vt and increased
   PEEP, will ask respiratory today to work with vent settings to attempt
   to adjust to make patient more comfortable if possible.
   - continue to treat for PNA w/ broad spectrum antibiotics Zosyn and
   Levofloxacin
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz, can use boluses for dysynchrony
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.
   Continued on levophed.  Requiring CVVH with increase in levophed while
   fluid removal
   - Cover broadly tapering down antibiotics per ID, with discontinuing
   clindamycin today given low likelihood of toxic shock, but will
   continue zosyn and levoflox for now
   - Percutaneous cholecystostomy denied by IR will follow recs
   - consider thoracentesis in the future, however futility unclear
   - appreciate ID recs
   - [**Doctor First Name **] negative
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes and increased RR
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN
   - Continue CVVH for volume removal given decrease in urine output, very
   significant anasarca and continuing to require pressors
   - Goal of 100cc of fluid removal per hour by CVVH, will attempt to
   concentrate medications, diuresed approx 3 L yesterday
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Improving now that the
   patient is off vancomycin.  Likely secondary to either medication
   effect or from overwhelming infection
   -          Follow heme/recs
   -          Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per CVVH and TPN
   orders
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a significant medical history of testicular cancer as a child, currently presenting with hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient has been intubated on CMV ventilation and is expected to remain intubated. He is being treated for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and sedation with fentanyl/midazolam. The patient is on CVVH for volume removal and has shown improvement in metabolic acidosis and thrombocytopenia. Other notable findings include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), electrolyte/fluid disorder, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and hyperglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient has evidence of pleural effusions contributing to respiratory failure. Maintaining appropriate ventilator settings and treating for PNA with broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential.

2. Shock: The patient is most consistent with septic or distributive shock. The source may be cholecystitis or pleural effusions. Broadly covering antibiotics, tapering down, and discontinuing clindamycin are recommended. Thoracentesis may be considered in the future.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: This condition has improved significantly, likely secondary to renal failure. Continued CVVH, low tidal volumes, and increased RR are necessary.

4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN."

   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure.  The patient has worsening of
   infiltrates on CXR today, may be volume overload in the setting of
   discontinuing CVVH.  Will consider starting lasix later today if
   patient remains stable.
   - intubated, changed to PCV, with improved vent compliance
   - switched antibiotic regimen yesterday to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child, currently presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including hypoxic respiratory failure, shock, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also on multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and zosyn) for sepsis coverage, sedation with fentanyl/midazolam, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening infiltrates on CXR and pleural effusions may contribute to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and consideration of starting lasix for fluid removal if the patient remains stable.
2. Shock: The patient is most consistent with septic or distributive shock, possibly due to cholecystitis or pleural effusions. Pressor support may be required, and broad antibiotic coverage should be continued.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidosis improved significantly, likely secondary to renal failure. Discontinuation of CVVH may be necessary, and consideration for restarting CVVH if required.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function improved, but ATN cannot be ruled out. Discontinuation of CVVH given increased UOP and improved renal function. Lasix drip for fluid removal may be considered later today if the patient remains hemodynamically stable.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology but continues to improve. Restarted vancomycin, so close monitoring is recommended.
6. Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic, resolving. Adjust sodium levels per TF today and continue to monitor closely.
7. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver or viral process. Consider sending viral loads and trend liver enzymes for now.
8. Hypothyroidism: Elevated TSH level, unknown outpatient dose. Empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified.
9. Hyperglycemia: Stress-related, covered with sliding scale insulin for now.
10. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: Close monitoring and management of fluid balance, electrolytes, and acid-base status are essential.

Please note that the patient's condition requires close monitoring and immediate intervention as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure
   - intubated on CMV, respiratory to work with vent settings to optimize
   performance
   - continue levo/zosyn
   - sedation with fentanyl/midaz, can use boluses for dysynchrony
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.
   Continued on levophed.  Requiring CVVH with increase in levophed while
   fluid removal
   - Cover broadly tapering down antibiotics per ID on [**Last Name (un) **]/zosyn
   - appreciate ID recs
   -overall improved and weaned off pressors overnight
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Improving with CVVH and low tidal volumes and increased RR, will
   attempt to increase PS to decrease RR
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, impoved
   - Continue CVVH for volume removal given decrease in urine output, very
   significant anasarca and continuing to require pressors, will discuss
   with renal the possibility of stopping CVVH and progressing to HD
   - Will decrease amount of fluid removed with CVVH in attempt to
   increase UOP
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Improving now that the
   patient is off vancomycin.  Likely secondary to either medication
   effect or from overwhelming infection
   -          Follow heme/recs
   -          Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per CVVH and
   begin TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TF, with reglan initiate gut movement
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**] replaced with
   radial line on [**2139-12-21**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer, currently in the ICU with hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has evidence of pleural effusions contributing to respiratory failure. He is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (likely ATN), thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia. The source of septic shock is unclear, with possible causes including cholecystitis or pleural effusions. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and CVVH for volume removal and renal support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pleural effusions contributing to his hypoxia. Continuous monitoring and optimization of ventilator settings are crucial.
2. Shock: The patient is most consistent with septic or distributive shock. Identifying and treating the underlying cause of sepsis is essential to improve hemodynamics and wean off pressors.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the cause of renal failure. CVVH has been initiated for volume removal and renal support. Close monitoring of urine output and discussing the possibility of transitioning to hemodialysis with the renal team is important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and pneumonia. The patient has been febrile since CVVH stopped, and pressures decreased to the 70s. Vancomycin was restarted, cultures were sent, and a fluid bolus was administered. PEEP was increased from 8 to 10, and FiO2 was increased to 0.60. Overnight LFTs were ordered, and TPN was restarted to provide additional nutrition due to possible infection. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient received various antibiotics including piperacillin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F (Tmax: 38.4°C), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/85 to 158/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 0.60. The patient's weight has increased from 52.7 kg at admission to 62.7 kg currently. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, with a total input of 6,131 mL and output of 6,227 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of -96 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CPAP/PSV, Vt of 588 mL, PS of 20 cmH2O, RR of 38 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 0.60, PIP of 31 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 100%. ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 252, and Ve of 11.1 L/min.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and other systems. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), bilirubin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood glucose levels. Other lab results include abnormal electrolyte levels such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), magnesium (Mg++), phosphate (PO43-), calcium (Ca++), and arterial blood gas (ABG) values.

Assessment and plan include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), electrolyte & fluid disorder, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, and other conditions. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, septic shock, acute kidney injury, infection-related complications, electrolyte imbalances, and ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-induced lung injury or ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure.  The patient has worsening of
   infiltrates on CXR today, may be volume overload in the setting of
   discontinuing CVVH.  Will consider starting lasix later today if
   patient remains stable.
   - intubated, changed to PCV, with improved vent compliance
   - switched antibiotic regimen yesterday to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   and zosyn.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]
   to discontinue pressor support.  Able to discontinue CVVH
   - Elevated temp yesterday and today, temperature may have been falsely
   low with CVVH, however, will send mini-BAL today given increased
   secretions and fever.  Will also get RUQ US given elevated temp,
   distended abdomen.
   - Cover broadly with antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, zosyn and
   vancomycin will attempt to narrow as tolerated.
   - appreciate ID recs
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved
   - Disocontinued CVVH given increased UOP and improved renal function.
   - Will consider using lasix drip for fluid removal later today if
   remains hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a significant medical history of testicular cancer, currently experiencing back pain. He was found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and is now in septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has evidence of pleural effusions, worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray, and may be volume overloaded.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. He also has metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening infiltrates on CXR and pleural effusions may contribute to respiratory failure.
2. Shock: The patient is most consistent with septic or distributive shock. The source of shock may be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, but it is unclear.
3. Metabolic acidosis: Improved significantly, likely secondary to renal failure given normal lactate and improvement with CVVH.
4. Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved, but may require restarting CVVH.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology, continues to improve.

   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of worsening pleural effusions on
   CT yesterday, likely contributing to respiratory failure.
   - will get IP to drain the right sided pleural effusion today to
   attempt to improve compliance and ventilatorly ease, evidence of
   possible empyema by fluid color and consistency, will follow studies
   and consider consulted CT surgery for possible procedure to prevent
   recurrence.
   - intubated, did not tolerate PCV, paralyzed and back on AC, will
   attempt to wean paralytics today.
   - switched antibiotic regimen yesterday to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   and zosyn will continue until results come back from pleural fluid
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz and wean paralytics
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.  The
   patient is back on pressors given hypotension yesterday and today.
   - Elevated temp persistent.  Pending mini-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send pleural fluid
   for analysis, culture and cell count.   Gallbladder continues to be
   distended on US however, wall not thickened.
   - Will get TEE to rule out culture negative endocarditis.  Discussed
   with ID the possibility of starting gentamycin for synergy and they do
   not want to start it in the setting of so many negative cultures.
   Instructed to wait for cultures from pleural fluid.
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, zosyn
   and vancomycin.
   - ID signed off, will discuss if cultures return positive
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**], continuing to worsen now that off CVVH
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved
   - Disocontinued CVVH given increased UOP and improved renal function.
   - Will consider using lasix drip for fluid removal if remains
   hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child, currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, shock (likely septic or distributive), acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned are:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: This can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potentially develop into ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The patient already has evidence of worsening pleural effusions on CT, which may contribute to respiratory failure. There is a plan to drain the right-sided pleural effusion to improve compliance and ease ventilation.

2. Septic or distributive shock: The patient is hypotensive and requires pressors. The source of sepsis could be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, but it is still unclear. There is a need to obtain pleural fluid for analysis, culture, and cell count. The patient is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and consideration is being given to gentamicin for synergy.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has ATN (Acute Tubular Necrosis) and improved renal function. CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemodialfiltration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52.7 kg, 60-inch male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics since admission, including piperacillin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient is currently on midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain control, respectively. Norepinephrine is being used to maintain blood pressure, and cisatracurium is being used for muscle relaxation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/48 to 149/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on an endotracheal tube with PCV+assist ventilation mode. The patient has a central venous pressure of 14 mmHg and fluid balance showing an intake of 2,349 mL, output of 1,025 mL, and a positive balance of 1,324 mL.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.6 mmol/L. Other lab values show elevated liver enzymes"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of pleural effusions, may be
   contributing to respiratory failure.  The patient has worsening of
   infiltrates on CXR today, may be volume overload in the setting of
   discontinuing CVVH.  Will consider starting lasix later today if
   patient remains stable.
   - intubated, changed to PCV, with improved vent compliance
   - switched antibiotic regimen yesterday to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   and zosyn.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]
   to discontinue pressor support.  Able to discontinue CVVH
   - Elevated temp yesterday and today, temperature may have been falsely
   low with CVVH, however, will send mini-BAL today given increased
   secretions and fever.  Will also get RUQ US given elevated temp,
   distended abdomen.
   - Cover broadly with antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, zosyn and
   vancomycin will attempt to narrow as tolerated.
   - appreciate ID recs
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved
   - Disocontinued CVVH given increased UOP and improved renal function.
   - Will consider using lasix drip for fluid removal later today if
   remains hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver, however may be
   secondary to viral process, will consider sending viral loads
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child, presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64-149 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a sinus tachycardia rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood cultures taken on 12/24/2139 were positive for Gram-negative rods. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.22, PaCO2 of 65 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 198.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may be contributing to respiratory failure. Pleural effusions may also be contributing to respiratory failure.

2. Shock: The patient is most consistent with septic or distributive shock. The source of the shock is unclear, but possibilities include cholecystitis or pleural effusions.

3. Acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo male presenting with sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   without clear source identified.  He now has continued support with
   pressors, ventilator and CVVH.  Of note is that he had increased
   difficulty with respiratory distress overnight and was given paralytics
   overnight.  Pressors have returned as well.  He has additional issues
   of persistent fevers and mild lactic acidosis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-FIO2 remains at 50%.  He does have impressively
   poor compliance at 15 with large right sided effusions.  He was unable
   to maintain adequate ventilation and was paralyzed last pm.  We will
   continue with CMV support.  The decision to tap the pleural effusion is
   a tough one with competing interests with chance of improving
   compliance to the point of allowing effective spontaneous respiration
   being potentially favorable.  In addition will have opportunity for
   diagnostic yield in the setting of recurrent and persistent fevers.
   -Thoracentesis
   -D/C Paralytics
   -More to PSV as possible
   2)Sepsis-He did have recurrent hypotension overnight in the setting of
   paralytics. Is a competing interest of needing to effect diuresis.
   -Continue ABX
Vanco/Cipro/ZOsyn
   -Will check pleural fluid for infection
   -IVF as needed
   -Look to wean pressors
   -Will pursue TEE given embolic phenomena on CT scan
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -HD when hemodynamically able
   -If volume overload is at issue would move to CVVH in the setting of
   persistent hypotension

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male who presented with sepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He is currently supported with pressors, ventilator, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, difficulty in maintaining adequate ventilation, and large right-sided effusions. He has also shown signs of poor compliance on the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with the need for continued support on the ventilator. The decision to perform thoracentesis (draining the pleural effusion) is being considered to improve compliance and potentially allow for effective spontaneous respiration. Diagnostic yield in the setting of recurrent and persistent fevers is also a consideration.
2. Sepsis: The patient continues to have recurrent hypotension, despite being on antibiotics. The need for diuresis and weaning off pressors is being planned. Pleural fluid analysis will be done to check for infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, and hemodialysis (HD) will be initiated when the patient is hemodynamically stable. CVVH will be considered if volume overload persists and there is persistent hypotension.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers without a clear source identified.
5. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's bilateral infiltrates and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest:  Polymorphic VT.  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   secondary to medications, reglan and ciprofloxacin. Discontinued these
   medications.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to endocarditis however unlikely given
   polymorphic etiology, however patient may have spread of questionable
   underlying malignancy into myocardium ?
   -          Amiodarone load and drip at 1mcg/hr for 6 hours then
   .5mcg/hr for 18 hrs following
   -          Consulted Cardiology regarding management
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -          Q4h lytes
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of worsening pleural effusions on
   CT yesterday, likely contributing to respiratory failure.   IP drained
   right side yesterday, put out 1.5 L in 24 hours.
   - intubated, did not tolerate PCV, paralyzed and back on AC, will
   attempt to wean paralytics today.
   - switched antibiotic regimen yesterday to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   and zosyn will continue until results come back from pleural fluid
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz and wean paralytics
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.  The
   patient is back on pressors given hypotension yesterday and today.
   - Elevated temp persistent.  Pending mini-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send pleural fluid
   for analysis, culture and cell count.   Gallbladder continues to be
   distended on US however, wall not thickened.
   - Will get TEE to rule out culture negative endocarditis.  Discussed
   with ID the possibility of starting gentamycin for synergy and they do
   not want to start it in the setting of so many negative cultures.
   Instructed to wait for cultures from pleural fluid.
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, zosyn
   and vancomycin.
   - ID signed off, will discuss if cultures return positive
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**], continuing to worsen now that off CVVH
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved
   - Disocontinued CVVH given increased UOP and improved renal function.
   - Will consider using lasix drip for fluid removal if remains
   hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TF, with reglan initiate gut movement
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**] replaced with
   radial line on [**2139-12-21**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child.
- He presented with back pain and was found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology.
- He experienced polymorphic VT, which led to cardiac arrest and required CPR and defibrillation.
- The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
- He has been intubated and sedated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and worsening pleural effusions.
- His shock is most consistent with septic or distributive shock, possibly secondary to cholecystitis or pleural effusions.
- The patient's metabolic acidosis improved significantly after CVVH and may require restarting.
- He has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN, and is being closely monitored.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving, but the cause is unclear.
- He has hyponatremia, resolving, and transaminitis likely secondary to shock liver.
- The patient also has hypothyroidism with an elevated TSH level.
- His hyperglycemia is being managed with sliding scale insulin.
- The patient has a fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and pneumonia.
- He is currently on TPN with lipids for nutrition and has multiple lines and catheters for ICU care.
- His code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to polymorphic VT. It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient on telemetry and manage any arrhythmias promptly.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pleural effusions and ARDS. Continuous monitoring and close management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are essential.
3. Septic Shock: The patient's shock is likely secondary to sepsis, possibly from an underlying infection such as cholecystitis or spread of malignancy. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and source control measures should be implemented as appropriate.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN. Close monitoring of renal function, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels is necessary. CVVH may be required again if renal function deteriorates.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving but remains a concern. Close monitoring of platelet counts and follow-up with hematology recommendations are important.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's stress-induced hyperglycemia should be managed with sliding scale insulin to maintain blood glucose levels within target range.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest:  Polymorphic VT.  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   secondary to medications, reglan and ciprofloxacin. Discontinued these
   medications
   -          Amiodarone load and drip at 1mcg/hr for 6 hours then
   .5mcg/hr for 18 hrs following
   -          Consulted Cardiology
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of worsening pleural effusions on
   CT yesterday, likely contributing to respiratory failure.
   - will get IP to drain the right sided pleural effusion today to
   attempt to improve compliance and ventilatorly ease, evidence of
   possible empyema by fluid color and consistency, will follow studies
   and consider consulted CT surgery for possible procedure to prevent
   recurrence.
   - intubated, did not tolerate PCV, paralyzed and back on AC, will
   attempt to wean paralytics today.
   - switched antibiotic regimen yesterday to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   and zosyn will continue until results come back from pleural fluid
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz and wean paralytics
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.  The
   patient is back on pressors given hypotension yesterday and today.
   - Elevated temp persistent.  Pending mini-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send pleural fluid
   for analysis, culture and cell count.   Gallbladder continues to be
   distended on US however, wall not thickened.
   - Will get TEE to rule out culture negative endocarditis.  Discussed
   with ID the possibility of starting gentamycin for synergy and they do
   not want to start it in the setting of so many negative cultures.
   Instructed to wait for cultures from pleural fluid.
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, zosyn
   and vancomycin.
   - ID signed off, will discuss if cultures return positive
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**], continuing to worsen now that off CVVH
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved
   - Disocontinued CVVH given increased UOP and improved renal function.
   - Will consider using lasix drip for fluid removal if remains
   hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TF, with reglan initiate gut movement
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**] replaced with
   radial line on [**2139-12-21**]
   # Code: full
   # Communication: Patient and his wife

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history significant for testicular cancer as a child. He presented with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and is now in septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient experienced cardiac arrest due to polymorphic VT, hypoxic respiratory failure possibly due to multifocal pneumonia and ARDS, shock consistent with septic or distributive shock, metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure, acute renal failure likely ATN, thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, hyponatremia likely hypovolemic, transaminitis likely secondary to shock liver, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not promptly managed.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has evidence of worsening pleural effusions, which may contribute to respiratory failure and potentially progress to ARDS.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a need for close monitoring and potential intervention such as CVVH or lasix drip for fluid removal.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and the etiology is unclear. It is important to follow hematology recommendations and monitor the platelet count closely.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Based on CXR, etiology multifocal PNA
   and ARDS.   The patient has evidence of worsening pleural effusions on
   CT yesterday, likely contributing to respiratory failure.
   - will get IP to drain the right sided pleural effusion today to
   attempt to improve compliance and ventilatorly ease, evidence of
   possible empyema by fluid color and consistency, will follow studies
   and consider consulted CT surgery for possible procedure to prevent
   recurrence.
   - intubated, did not tolerate PCV, paralyzed and back on AC, will
   attempt to wean paralytics today.
   - switched antibiotic regimen yesterday to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin
   and zosyn will continue until results come back from pleural fluid
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz and wean paralytics
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.  The
   patient is back on pressors given hypotension yesterday and today.
   - Elevated temp persistent.  Pending mini-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send pleural fluid
   for analysis, culture and cell count.   Gallbladder continues to be
   distended on US however, wall not thickened.
   - Will get TEE to rule out culture negative endocarditis.  Discussed
   with ID the possibility of starting gentamycin for synergy and they do
   not want to start it in the setting of so many negative cultures.
   Instructed to wait for cultures from pleural fluid.
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, zosyn
   and vancomycin.
   - ID signed off, will discuss if cultures return positive
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**], continuing to worsen now that off CVVH
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved
   - Disocontinued CVVH given increased UOP and improved renal function.
   - Will consider using lasix drip for fluid removal if remains
   hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TF, with reglan initiate gut movement
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer as a child, presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and now in septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient has several medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of worsening pleural effusions on CT, likely contributing to respiratory failure. The plan is to drain the right-sided pleural effusion today to improve compliance and ventilatory ease.

2. Shock: The patient is most consistent with septic or distributive shock, possibly due to cholecystitis or pleural effusions. Pressors have been given due to hypotension.

3. Metabolic acidosis: Improved significantly, likely secondary to renal failure. CVVH was used and discontinued yesterday but may require restarting.

4. Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved with CVVH. CVVH was discontinued given increased UOP and improved renal function.

5. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology, but improving. Vancomycin was restarted, so it will be followed closely as it may have been the cause of thrombocytopenia.

6. Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic, resolving. Adjust per TF today.

7. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver. Trend for now.

8. Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated at"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest:  Polymorphic VT.  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   secondary to medications, reglan and ciprofloxacin. Discontinued these
   medications.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to endocarditis however unlikely given
   polymorphic etiology, however patient may have spread of questionable
   underlying malignancy into myocardium ?
   -          Amiodarone load and drip at 1mcg/hr for 6 hours then
   .5mcg/hr for 18 hrs following
   -          Consulted Cardiology regarding management
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -          Q4h lytes
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Secondary to ARDS and pleural
   effusions.   The patient has evidence of worsening pleural effusions on
   CT yesterday, likely contributing to respiratory failure.   IP drained
   right side yesterday, put out 1.5 L in 24 hours.
   - intubated, after the thoracentesis yesterday was able to wean to PSV,
   however following code the patient was placed back on AC with sedation,
   but paralytics held.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotic regimen with vancomycin and zosyn,
   discontinued ciprofloxacin as above.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz as tolerated, going slowly
   today given recent code.
   - Consider taping the other pleural space tomorrow when more stable
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.  The
   patient is back on pressors given hypotension yesterday and today.
   - Elevated temp persistent.  Pending mini-BAL, pleural fluid cultures.
   Gallbladder continues to be distended on US however, wall not
   thickened.
   - Will get TEE on Monday to rule out culture negative endocarditis.
   Discussed with ID the possibility of starting gentamycin for synergy
   and they do not want to start it in the setting of so many negative
   cultures.  Instructed to wait for cultures from pleural fluid.
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with zosyn and
   vancomycin.
   - ID signed off, will discuss if cultures return positive
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis/ARF:  improved significantly, worsened following
   the code, likely was secondary to renal failure given normal lactate
   and improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting, or starting HD.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**], staying stable currently.
   - Monitor UOP, increasing steadily
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TF, will discontinue reglan given VT.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a past medical history of testicular cancer as a child. He presented with back pain and was found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and is now in septic shock of unclear etiology. 

The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to polymorphic VT, which was unresponsive to medications such as Reglan and Ciprofloxacin. Amiodarone was administered, and cardiology consultation was obtained. The patient also has hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS and pleural effusions. He underwent thoracentesis, which drained 1.5 liters of fluid from the right pleural space. 

The patient is in shock, most consistent with septic or distributive shock. The source of infection may be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, but it is still unclear. The patient's temperature is elevated, and he has persistent fever. Mini-BAL and pleural fluid cultures have been pending. 

The patient has metabolic acidosis/ARF, which improved significantly but worsened following a code. It is likely secondary to renal failure given normal lactate levels and improvement with CVVH. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, which continues to improve. Vancomycin was restarted, so it will be followed closely as it may have been the cause of thrombocytopenia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest:  Polymorphic VT.  Unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   secondary to medications, reglan and ciprofloxacin. Discontinued these
   medications.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to endocarditis however unlikely given
   polymorphic etiology, however patient may have spread of questionable
   underlying malignancy into myocardium ?
   -          Amiodarone load and drip at 1mcg/hr for 6 hours then
   .5mcg/hr for 18 hrs following
   -          Consulted Cardiology regarding management
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -          Q4h lytes
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Secondary to ARDS and pleural
   effusions.   The patient has evidence of worsening pleural effusions on
   CT yesterday, likely contributing to respiratory failure.   IP drained
   right side yesterday, put out 1.5 L in 24 hours.
   - intubated, after the thoracentesis yesterday was able to wean to PSV,
   however following code the patient was placed back on AC with sedation,
   but paralytics held.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotic regimen with vancomycin and zosyn,
   discontinued ciprofloxacin as above.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz as tolerated, going slowly
   today given recent code.
   # Shock: Most consistent with septic or distributive shock.  Source may
   be cholecystitis or pleural effusions, however still very unclear.  The
   patient is back on pressors given hypotension yesterday and today.
   - Elevated temp persistent.  Pending mini-BAL, pleural fluid cultures.
   Gallbladder continues to be distended on US however, wall not
   thickened.
   - Will get TEE on Monday to rule out culture negative endocarditis.
   Discussed with ID the possibility of starting gentamycin for synergy
   and they do not want to start it in the setting of so many negative
   cultures.  Instructed to wait for cultures from pleural fluid.
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with zosyn and
   vancomycin.
   - ID signed off, will discuss if cultures return positive
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis:  improved significantly, worsened following the
   code, likely was secondary to renal failure given normal lactate and
   improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting, or starting HD.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**], staying stable.
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN, improved
   - Disocontinued CVVH given increased UOP and improved renal function.
   - Will consider using lasix drip for fluid removal if remains
   hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow renal recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TF, with reglan initiate gut movement
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**] replaced with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock. He experienced a cardiac arrest due to polymorphic VTach, and his hypoxic respiratory failure is secondary to ARDS and pleural effusions. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, intubated, and placed on mechanical ventilation. His condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to polymorphic VTach, which can be potentially life-threatening if not promptly managed.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to ARDS and pleural effusions. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs, potentially resulting in organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Septic Shock: The patient is most consistent with septic or distributive shock, possibly due to cholecystitis or pleural effusions. Septic shock can lead to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and mortality if not promptly treated.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to ATN. Acute renal failure can lead to fluid overload"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo male with prolonged course with severe and persistent respiratory
   failure now with single episode of VT last pm requiring CPR and
   defibrillation with rapid return of effective circulation within 5
   minutes.  His episode of VT was not obviously triggered--Reglan
   increase is the only medication change at the time and upon review QTc
   was stable.
   Respiratory Failure
Continued support with low Vt ventilation.
   -Continue with PEEP at 5
   -Move to wean with PSV trial if ventilation, oxygenation maintained
   Pleural Effusion-
   -CT to drainage
   -Will follow up cultures from fluid but did not appear to be frank
   Empyema but with low pH would favor drainage.  No evidence of
   significant pleural rind to argue for any further intervention.
   Sepsis-_Etiology unclear still but did have trend to better with
   Levophed weaned yesterday
   -Vanco/Zosyn continuing
   -Cultures pending from most recent fever
   -Would add Meropenem if recurrent fevers persist
   Ventricular Tachycardia-The trigger for this is not clear but will
   -D/C Cipro and Reglan
   -Will continue to control electrolytes
   -Endocarditis raised as a possibility but more typically monomorphic VT
   -ECG without clear answer
   -Amiodarone started during code and will continue for now
   -EP to eval for consideration of long term support with Amiodarone with
   end of acute illness
   -TEE still scheduled for Monday

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male who has been experiencing severe and persistent respiratory failure. The patient had an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) last night, which required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation support with low Vt ventilation. The plan is to continue with PEEP at 5 and move to wean with pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial if ventilation and oxygenation are maintained.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, which requires drainage. A CT scan will be done to guide the drainage, and cultures from the fluid will be followed up.
3. Sepsis: The etiology of sepsis is unclear, but the patient is showing some improvement with Levophed weaned yesterday. The current plan is to continue with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and pending cultures will be reviewed. Meropenem will be"

   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest [**1-18**] ventricular fibrillation:  Etiology still
   unknown.  Per EP, only toxic/metabolic syndrome of critical illness
   could be responsible.
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -EP rec goal K 5.0, Mg 2.5,
   - Amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 7**] in AM while critically ill
   - TSH, T3, FT4
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Secondary to ARDS and pleural
   effusions.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotic regimen with vancomycin and zosyn
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz as tolerated, going slowly
   today given recent code.
   - Bronchoscopy of left lung with lavage
   - Consider Chest ultrasound
   - Hemolysis labs
   # Shock: Septic or distributive shock: no source identified.
   - Elevated temp persistent.
   - TEE today
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with zosyn and
   vancomycin.
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis/ARF:  improved significantly, worsened following
   the code, likely was secondary to renal failure given normal lactate
   and improved with CVVH
   - - Will trend Cr [**Hospital1 7**], staying stable currently.
   - Monitor UOP, increasing steadily
   - Likely d/c dialysis catheter today
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TF, will discontinue reglan given VT.

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history significant for testicular cancer as a child, presenting with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient experienced cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, and the etiology is still unknown. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently on telemetry for monitoring. The recommended potassium level is K 5.0, magnesium level is 2.5, and the patient is being given amiodarone 400 mg in the morning while critically ill. Further investigations such as TSH, T3, FT4 are also required.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has secondary ARDS and pleural effusions, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and Zosyn should be continued. A bronchoscopy of the left lung with lavage is planned, along with consideration of a chest ultrasound. Hemolysis labs will also be performed.

3. Shock: The patient is in septic or distributive shock, with no identified source. Elevated temperature persists, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is scheduled today. Antibiotic coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin should be continued.

4. Metabolic Acidosis/ARF: The patient's metabolic acidosis and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, malnutrition, fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are receiving mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode. They have a history of multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows opacification in the left lung and the presence of a chest tube in the right lung. The patient's condition is critical, and they require ongoing ICU care with close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and medication administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture results is essential.
2. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring hospital-acquired infections, such as bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections. Frequent assessment of vital signs and regular review of laboratory results are necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function may deteriorate due to sepsis and fluid management issues. Monitoring serum creatinine"

   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -          Q4h lytes
   -EP rec goal K 5.0, Mg 2.5, Begin Amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 7**] in AM
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Secondary to ARDS and pleural
   effusions.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotic regimen with vancomycin and zosyn,
   discontinued ciprofloxacin as above.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz as tolerated, going slowly
   today given recent code.
   - Consider tapping the other pleural space tomorrow when more stable
   # Shock: Septic or distributive shock: no source identified.
   - Elevated temp persistent.
   - TEE today
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with zosyn and
   vancomycin.
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis/ARF:  improved significantly, worsened following
   the code, likely was secondary to renal failure given normal lactate
   and improval with CVVH
   - Discontinued CVVH yesterday, may require restarting, or starting HD.
   - Will trend Crn [**Hospital1 7**], staying stable currently.
   - Monitor UOP, increasing steadily
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child. He presents with back pain, hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient experienced cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest, which is a serious life-threatening event. Immediate intervention was required, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). The patient is now on telemetry monitoring and has been prescribed antiarrhythmic medication (Amiodarone).

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing secondary to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and pleural effusions. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued, and sedation with fentanyl/midazolam will be maintained as tolerated. Consideration for tapping the other pleural space tomorrow when more stable.

3. Shock: The patient is suspected to be in septic or distributive shock due to the lack of identified source. Elevated temperature persists, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been scheduled for today. Antibiotic coverage will continue with Zosyn and vancomycin.

4. Metabolic Acidosis/ARF: The patient's metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure have improved significantly but worsened following"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest [**1-18**] ventricular fibrillation:  Etiology still
   unknown.  Per EP, only toxic/metabolic syndrome of critical illness
   could be responsible.
   -          Monitor on telemetry, no subsequent events
   -EP rec goal K 5.0, Mg 2.5, will check lytes q8h
   - Amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 7**] in AM while critically ill
   - TSH, T3, FT4 not significantly off from baseline to cause V tach
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Secondary to ARDS and pleural
   effusions.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz as tolerated, will attempt to
   wean back to PSV as oxygenating better today.
   - Bronchoscopy of left lung with lavage yesterday, BAL with no
   organisms
   - CXR looks like volume overload.  Will attempt to start diuresis with
   lasix drip today while transfusing one unit of PRBCs
   # Shock: Septic or distributive shock: no source identified.
   - Continue pressors and attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Elevated temp persistent.   Will check c diff today.
   - TEE did not show evidence of vegetations
   - Will discontinue antibiotics today and follow fever curve and
   leukocytosis as antibiotics were not changing course.  Will restart
   antibiotics if the patient has increased fevers or worsening
   leukocytosis.
   #  Anemia:  Unclear etiology, likely from BM suppression from infection
   -          Tranfuse one unit of PRBCs today
   -          Trend Hct
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis/ARF:  continues to improve, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improved with CVVH
   - Will continue to trend Cr [**Hospital1 7**], staying stable currently.
   - Monitor UOP, increasing steadily
   - Likely d/c dialysis catheter today
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve, however
   now has evidence of thrombocytosis most likely secondary to infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  remaining stable.  Likely hypovolemic
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Was on 100mg orally at home
   - empirically giving 50 mcg IV daily and will consider adjusting
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin
   # FEN: TF,  replete electrolytes prn,
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child, currently presenting with back pain and found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient experienced cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, which was successfully treated. He also has hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS and pleural effusions, shock (septic or distributive), anemia of unclear etiology, metabolic acidosis/acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, indicating a potential risk for future cardiac events.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has secondary ARDS and pleural effusions, which can lead to further respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxia or pneumonia.
3. Septic shock: The patient is in septic shock with an unknown source of infection, increasing the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for ongoing dialysis support.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of unclear etiology, which may require blood transfusions and monitoring of hematocrit"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest [**1-18**] ventricular fibrillation:  Etiology still
   unknown.  Per EP, only toxic/metabolic syndrome of critical illness
   could be responsible.
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -EP rec goal K 5.0, Mg 2.5,
   - Amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 7**] in AM while critically ill
   - TSH, T3, FT4
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Secondary to ARDS and pleural
   effusions.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotic regimen with vancomycin and zosyn
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz as tolerated, going slowly
   today given recent code.
   - Bronchoscopy of left lung with lavage
   - Consider Chest ultrasound
   - Hemolysis labs
   # Shock: Septic or distributive shock: no source identified.
   - Elevated temp persistent.
   - TEE today
   - Continue to cover broadly with antibiotics with zosyn and
   vancomycin.
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis/ARF:  improved significantly, worsened following
   the code, likely was secondary to renal failure given normal lactate
   and improved with CVVH
   - - Will trend Cr [**Hospital1 7**], staying stable currently.
   - Monitor UOP, increasing steadily
   - Likely d/c dialysis catheter today
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve.
   Restarted vancomycin, so will follow closely as may have been cause of
   thrombocytopenia.
   - Follow heme/recs
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely hypovolemic, Resolving, adjust per TF today
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Unknown outpatient dose.
   - empirically give 50 mcg IV daily until dose clarified
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin for now
   # FEN: TF, will discontinue reglan given VT.
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a significant medical history of testicular cancer as a child. The patient presented with back pain and was found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and is currently in septic shock of unclear etiology.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. The etiology is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to toxic/metabolic syndrome of critical illness.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has secondary hypoxic respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pleural effusions. Broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen with vancomycin and Zosyn is being continued. Sedation with fentanyl/midazolam is ongoing as tolerated.

3. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic or distributive shock with no identified source. Elevated temperature persists, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been performed. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin is being continued.

4. Metabolic Acidosis/ARF: The patient had improved significantly, but worsened following a code, likely secondary to renal failure. The condition improved with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's creatinine levels are stable currently.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest [**1-18**] ventricular fibrillation:  Etiology still
   unknown.  Per EP, only toxic/metabolic syndrome of critical illness
   could be responsible.
   -          Monitor on telemetry, no subsequent events
   -EP rec goal K 5.0, Mg 2.5, will check lytes q8h
   - Amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 7**] in AM while critically ill (on pressors)
   - TSH, T3, FT4 not significantly off from baseline to cause V tach
   - Continue tele
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Secondary to ARDS and pleural
   effusions.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz as tolerated, will attempt to
   wean back to PSV as oxygenating better today.
   - F/U BAL with no organisms
   - CXR looks like volume overload, but improved from yesterday.  Will
   hold diuresis as UOP improving and will likely diurese on his own.
   Particularly as he was sensitive to lasix yesterday and had to go back
   on pressors.
   - Currently not on antibiotics.  Fever could represent drug reaction or
   other inflammatory response and will continue to hold antibiotics until
   cultures are positive.
   # Shock: Septic or distributive shock: no source identified.
   - Continue pressors and attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Elevated temp persistent.   Will check c diff today again as lab
   error with previous sample
   - TEE did not show evidence of vegetations
   - Will discontinue antibiotics today and follow fever curve and
   leukocytosis as antibiotics were not changing course.  Will restart
   antibiotics if the patient has increased fevers or worsening
   leukocytosis.
   #  Anemia:  Unclear etiology, likely from BM suppression from infection
   -          Tranfuse one unit of PRBCs yesterday afternoon
   -          Trend Hct
   -          Will investigate further if no improvement in [**1-19**] days.
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis/ARF:  continues to improve, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improved with CVVH
   - Will continue to trend Cr [**Hospital1 7**], staying stable currently.
   - Monitor UOP, increasing steadily
   - Dialysis catheter discontinued yesterday.
   #.  Thrombocytosis:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve, however
   now has evidence of thrombocytosis most likely secondary to infection
   or other reactive component.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  remaining stable.  Likely hypovolemic
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Was on 100mg orally at home
   - empirically giving 50 mcg IV daily and will consider adjusting

   sliding scale insulin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child. He presented with back pain and was found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced ventricular fibrillation, but no subsequent events have occurred since being monitored on telemetry.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: This is secondary to ARDS and pleural effusions. The patient continues to be sedated with fentanyl/midazolam as tolerated, with an attempt to wean back to pressure support ventilation as oxygenation improves.

3. Shock: The patient is in septic or distributive shock, with no identified source. Pressors are being continued and attempts are being made to wean as tolerated.

4. Fever: The patient has persistent elevated temperature, which could represent a drug reaction or other inflammatory response. Antibiotics have been withheld until cultures are positive.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of unclear etiology, likely from bone marrow suppression due to infection. One unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was transfused yesterday afternoon, and the trend in hemoglobin concentration is being monitored.

6. Metabolic Acidosis/ARF: The patient's metabolic acidosis continues to improve, likely secondary to renal failure. It has improved with continuous veno-venous hem"

   following commands.  Very weak.  BP has improved.  Baseline temp down
   today but spike to 101.  Creat is slowly decreasing w/o further CVVH.
   He remains an enigma.  Continued fever, severe parenchymal (L >> R)
   infiltrate but multiple, multiple cx are neg.  We have discontinued abx
 too early to establish if this is a drug fever.  No eosinophilia but
   must consider other processes to explain pulm process. Nothing to
   suggest signif CHF.  Substantial airway component with purulent sputum
   so inflammatory process less likely but aspiration may have been an
   early event.  WBC seems to be rel stable at 13 K.  Will continue to try

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical history of testicular cancer as a child, currently presenting with hypoxia, acute renal failure, and septic shock of unclear etiology. He has experienced multiple complications including cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS and pleural effusions, shock (septic or distributive), anemia, metabolic acidosis/acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and hyperglycemia. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, fever, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), electrolyte & fluid disorder, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and pneumonia. He is currently receiving critical care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, which could potentially recur if the underlying cause is not identified and addressed.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the ARDS and pleural effusions are not managed appropriately.
3. Shock: The patient is at risk for further episodes of shock, especially if the septic source is not identified and treated promptly.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may progress if the underlying cause is not determined and treated accordingly.
5. Metabolic acidosis/acute renal failure: There is a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 41 M w/ pmh significant for testicular cancer as a child, p/w
   back pain, found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, now in septic
   shock still of unclear etiology.
   # Cardiac Arrest [**1-18**] ventricular fibrillation:  Etiology still
   unknown.  Per EP, only toxic/metabolic syndrome of critical illness
   could be responsible.
   -          Monitor on telemetry, no subsequent events
   -EP rec goal K 5.0, Mg 2.5, will check lytes q8h
   - Amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 7**] in AM while critically ill
   - TSH, T3, FT4 not significantly off from baseline to cause V tach
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:   Secondary to ARDS and pleural
   effusions.
   - Continue sedation with fentanyl/midaz as tolerated, will attempt to
   wean back to PSV as oxygenating better today.
   - Bronchoscopy of left lung with lavage yesterday, BAL with no
   organisms
   - CXR looks like volume overload.  Will attempt to start diuresis with
   lasix drip today while transfusing one unit of PRBCs
   # Shock: Septic or distributive shock: no source identified.
   - Continue pressors and attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Elevated temp persistent.   Will check c diff today.
   - TEE did not show evidence of vegetations
   - Will discontinue antibiotics today and follow fever curve and
   leukocytosis as antibiotics were not changing course.  Will restart
   antibiotics if the patient has increased fevers or worsening
   leukocytosis.
   #  Anemia:  Unclear etiology, likely from BM suppression from infection
   -          Tranfuse one unit of PRBCs today
   -          Trend Hct
   #.  Metabolic Acidosis/ARF:  continues to improve, likely was secondary
   to renal failure given normal lactate and improved with CVVH
   - Will continue to trend Cr [**Hospital1 7**], staying stable currently.
   - Monitor UOP, increasing steadily
   - Likely d/c dialysis catheter today
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Continues to improve, however
   now has evidence of thrombocytosis most likely secondary to
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  remaining stable.  Likely hypovolemic
   - will continue to monitor closely
   # Transaminitis: likely secondary to shock liver
   - trend for now
   # Hypothyroid: TSH elevated at 14.  Was on 100mg orally at home
   - empirically giving 50 mcg IV daily and will consider adjusting
   # Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of stress.  Will cover with
   sliding scale insulin
   # FEN: TF,  replete electrolytes prn,
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: RIJ placed [**12-15**], R femoral art line placed [**12-17**] replaced with
   radial line on [**2139-12-21**]

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer as a child, presenting with back pain and found to have hypoxia, acute renal failure, and now in septic shock of unclear etiology. The patient experienced cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, with an unknown etiology, but was successfully resuscitated.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS and pleural effusions. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy of the left lung with lavage, but the BAL showed no organisms. The chest X-ray suggests volume overload, and the patient is being started on a lasix drip today while transfusing one unit of PRBCs.

The patient is also in shock, possibly septic or distributive shock, with no identified source. The patient's temperature is elevated and persistent, and c. diff testing is pending. The patient has anemia with an unclear etiology, likely from BM suppression from infection, and is being transfused with one unit of PRBCs today.

The patient has metabolic acidosis/ARF that is improving, likely secondary to renal failure given normal lactate and improved with CVVH. The patient's creatinine levels are stable currently, and the dialysis catheter will likely be discontinued today.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia with an unclear etiology, but it is improving. The patient's hyponatremia is remaining stable, likely hypovole"
