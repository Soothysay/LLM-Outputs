   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: ongoing problems with ventricular
   arrhythmias necessitating ICD therapies.  He continues to diurese.
   Will get EPS consult for guidance on antiarrhythmic therapy.  He is
   intolerant of amiodarone due to severe GI upset
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He is morbidly obese and has been admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic heart failure. The patient has had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and polymorphic VT, which required ICD firing. His current medications include milrinone, lasix, toprol XL, metolazone, spironolactone, and acetazolamide. The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are being monitored, and he is on telemetry. His length of stay is 57.2 liters diuresed, and he is now off milrinone and neosynephrine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of VT, which could potentially lead to further arrhythmias and require additional antiarrhythmic therapy.
2. Diuretic Overdose: The patient is on multiple diuretics, including lasix and metolazone, which can cause electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.5 to 2.2, indicating a possible decline in renal function.
4. Gout Flare: The patient had a gout flare in his big toe, which requires management with appropriate medication.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's poor cardiac output and diuresis may lead to inadequate nutrition, which could impact his overall recovery.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, and there is a concern for low blood pressure due to medications like lisinopril being held.
7. Potential Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his prolonged hospital stay and invasive lines.
8. Medication Intolerance: The patient is intolerant to amiodarone due to severe gastrointestinal upset."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%.
- He has been admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.
- The patient had two episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) overnight, which responded to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing.
- His potassium and magnesium levels are currently within normal range.
- The patient is currently stable without symptoms.
- The plan is to consult an electrophysiologist (EP) due to the patient's history of multiple episodes of sustained VT.
- Antiarrhythmic medication may be considered.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring on telemetry.
- Diuretics (turosemide and metolazone) and beta-blockers (Toprol XL) are being continued.
- Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is being held due to low blood pressure and renal failure.
- Other medical issues include gout, diarrhea, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of multiple episodes of VT and the recent episodes of polymorphic VT indicate a high risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. He had two episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) overnight, which required transfer back to the CCU.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91% on room air, and a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius. The patient is hemodynamically stable without symptoms.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Rhythm: The patient had two episodes of ICD firing due to polymorphic VT. It is recommended to consider anti-arrhythmic medication as the patient has had at least five episodes of sustained VT over the course of admission. Monitor on telemetry and check potassium and magnesium levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, and morbid obesity. He has been admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic heart failure and requires IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient also has ongoing issues with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and ICD firing.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1 C (97%), heart rate 75 bpm (70-79), blood pressure 86/67 mmHg, respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute (19-53), and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is AV paced.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and other abnormalities. The patient's weight has decreased from 189.9 kg on admission to 137.2 kg currently.

The patient has several medical conditions including dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, ventricular arrhythmias, gout, and renal failure. He is currently on multiple medications including milrinone, lasix, metolazone, spironolactone, to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He has morbid obesity with an initial weight of over 415 lbs. The patient underwent biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement with left bundle branch block (LBBB). He also has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. He has had recurrent ventricular arrhythmias with ICD firing, necessitating readmission to the CCU.

The patient's current condition is stable without symptoms. However, he has intractable gastrointestinal symptoms with amiodarone in the past. The physician recommends an electrophysiology (EP) consult to question if the patient is a transplant candidate. They also suggest considering anti-arrhythmic medication, particularly amiodarone, as the patient has experienced at least five episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient's potassium and magnesium levels should be monitored with the goal of maintaining high normal levels. Telemetry monitoring is recommended. Digoxin has been stopped. The patient will continue on metoprolol (Toprol XL) 300"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

The patient has ongoing issues with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, resulting in ICD firing. The medical team is considering anti-arrhythmic therapy, especially since the patient has had at least 5 episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). They are also monitoring the patient's potassium and magnesium levels, aiming for a high normal range. Telemetry monitoring is being continued.

Regarding the patient's heart failure, he has been diuresed 55 liters and is currently off milrinone and neosynephrine. Diuretics have been held overnight due to renal failure. The team plans to continue the current diuretic regimen, including turpentine 60mg, metolazone 5mg orally once a day, spironolactone 50mg orally daily, and Toprol XL 300mg orally once"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid obesity, and a history of BiV/ICD with LBBB. The patient was admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic CHF and required IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis. He has ongoing issues with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, which have resulted in ICD firing.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 101/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is AV paced.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 14.2 g/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride level of 105 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 34 mEq/L, BUN level of 22 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, glucose level of 116 mg/dL, and a slightly elevated troponin-T level of 0.04.

The patient's weight has decreased from 189.9 kg on admission to 135.8 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of -2070 mL since midnight. The patient has been producing a significant amount of urine, with an output of 100cc/hr consistently since midnight.

The patient's physical examination reveals marked chest heave, loud S3, no murmurs or gallops, distended abdomen, no lower extremity edema, and stasis dermatitis in both lower extremities. The patient's pulses are difficult to palpate due to edema, but his feet are warm, well-perfused, and have good capillary refill.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has a history of BiV/ICD with LBBB and ongoing issues with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, which have resulted in ICD firing. Close monitoring of the patient's rhythm is necessary to prevent further arrhythmias.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily increasing, indicating possible renal failure. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to manage the renal failure.
3. Hyponatremia/hypochloremia: The patient has hyponatremia and hypochloremia, which could be due to intravasculary low volume triggering ADH. Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels is required to prevent any imbalance.
4. Gout flare: The patient has a history of gout, and there is a flare in his left big toe. Close monitoring for worsening symptoms and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Diarrhea: The patient has had diarrhea, which has improved but may still require ongoing management with loper"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and Lasix for diuresis. He is currently stable without symptoms but has ongoing issues with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and ICD firing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient's history of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and ICD firing indicates an ongoing risk of life-threatening cardiac events.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and systolic CHF pose a risk for further deterioration in cardiac function, leading to worsening heart failure symptoms and potential complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and recent diuretic use suggest a potential risk for renal failure, which can be exacerbated by poor cardiac output and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: The patient's electrolyte imbalances may require careful monitoring and"

He was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF and required intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. He has ongoing issues with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and recent episodes of ICD firing.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 72 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 101/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%, and temperature (T) of 36.5°C. His weight is 135.8 kg, and he has lost 54 kg since admission.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 14.2 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 45.0%, platelet count (Plt) of 369 K/uL, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, blood glucose of 114 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 105 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.7 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) of 4.6 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) of 10.7 mg/dL, and albumin of 3.9 g/dL.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative 2070 mL over 24 hours, with total input of 960 mL (including 960 mL orally) and total output of 3030 mL (including 620 mL urinary). His weight has increased by 3.8 kg since midnight.

Physical examination reveals general appearance of being alert and oriented, with no cyanosis of the oral mucosa or xanthalesma. The neck is supple, and the cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm with marked ectopy, normal S1 and S2 sounds, and a loud S3 gallop. There is no jugular venous distention (JVD) or peripheral edema noted. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and the abdomen is distended but non-tender. No bowel sounds are appreciated due to the level of distention. Extremities show no edema, and pulses are difficult to palpate in the lower extremities due to edema. The skin shows stasis dermatitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF and required intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient has ongoing issues with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and recent episodes of ICD firing, requiring readmission to the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and ICD firing: The patient's history of bi-ventricular ICD with LBBB and recent episodes of ICD firing indicate potential life-threatening arrhythmias. Close monitoring and adjustment of the ICD settings may be necessary to prevent further episodes.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure, possibly secondary to poor cardiac output. Holding diuretics, monitoring I/O, and adjusting medications accordingly are recommended.
3. Hyponatremia/hypochloremia: The patient has developed hyponatremia and hypochloremia, likely due to intravasculary low volume triggering antidi"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of BiV/ICD with LBBB. He was admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic CHF and required IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient had recurrent ventricular arrhythmias with ICD firing, which have since resolved. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm: The patient has a history of BiV/ICD with LBBB and recent episodes of ICD firing. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's rhythm and ensure proper management of any future arrhythmias.
2. Pump/Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has experienced decompensated systolic heart failure, requiring diuretics for fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is necessary, as diuretics have been held due to renal failure. Restarting metolazone, torsemide, aldactone, and acetazolamide will help manage fluid balance and hypertension.
3. Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.5 to 2.1, indicating possible acute renal failure secondary to poor cardiac output. Holding diuretics and monitoring creatinine levels are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He has morbid obesity and was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient had ongoing issues with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, which appeared to have resolved. He is currently stable without symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's history of ICD firing and recurrent ventricular arrhythmias indicates a potential risk for future rhythm disturbances.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient required aggressive diuresis for fluid overload, suggesting a risk for recurrent fluid overload and heart failure exacerbation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels, may be due to poor cardiac output. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of diuretic therapy are necessary.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's total body potassium depletion led to ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, close monitoring of electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, is crucial.
5. Gout Flare: The patient experienced a gout flare in the left big toe. Regular monitoring and management of gout symptoms are important.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of bilateral ventricular (BiV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient was admitted to the coronary critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

The patient experienced recurrent ventricular arrhythmias with ICD firing but appears to have resolved. The arrhythmias were likely due to total body potassium depletion. The patient has had intractable gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with amiodarone in the past, so amiodarone is not being administered at this time.

The patient's potassium levels are being monitored daily with the goal of maintaining a high level of 4.0. The patient is on telemetry and will receive oral potassium chloride (KCl) 40 mEq twice today to replete total body potassium.

The patient's fluid balance is negative 63.5 liters, indicating significant diuresis. Diuretics have been held for 24 hours due to renal failure, but will be restarted today with metolazone 5 mg daily, torsemide 40 mg daily, aldactone 50"

   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight on admission in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD
   with LBBB, OSA who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated
   systolic CHF requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis and now with
   63 Liters diuresed.   He then had ongoing issues with recurrent
   ventricular arrhythmias with ICD firing, which appear to have
   resolved.
   .
   . # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD.  Patient with recent episodes of ICD firing,
   requiring readmission to the CCU. Patient currently stable without
   symptoms.  Has had intractable GI symptoms with amiodarone in the
   past.   Arrhythmias were likely due to total body potassium depletion.
   - Appreciate EP Consult
   - No Amio at this time.
   - Check daily K/Mg, with goal of high 4
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Toprol XL 300mg, have stopped digoxin
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Length of stay 62.4 liters
   diuresed.  Now off milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix drip. Continuing
   to diurese, and have held diuretics for 24 hours due to renal failure.
   - Will restart Metolazone 5mg daily, Torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 7**], Aldactone 50mg
   Daily, Acetazolamide 250 Daily now that fluid balance is less than net
   negative 2 liters.
   - Will continue to hold lisinopril [**2-18**] low BP and renal failure
   - Switch to daily Chem 7s
   - Replete Potassium  PRN, Goal K of 4.5.
 will give KCl 40mEq po x 2
   today in order to replete total body potassium
   - Monitor I/O
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Secondary to poor cardiac output.
   Creatinine on admission 1.5, now at 2.1 which is slowly improving over
   the last few days.
   - Have held diuretics, as renal failure likely pre-renal in etiology
   (FeUrea <35), but will restart today
   - Continue to hold lisinopril at this time
   - Monitor Creatinine
   .
   #Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: Intravasculary low volume which triggers
   ADH; Developed slowly over the past 2 weeks on Lasix gtt.  Stable over
   the past week. Acetazolamide mildly improved values.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD, no cath in past
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Gout: Flare in left big toe.  Stable today.
   - Colchicine/tylenol as needed.
   # Diarrhea: Improved
    -Continue loperamide as needed
   .
   # OSA
   - Not on bipap at home

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: [**Known firstname **] has been quite stable without
   long runs of vt.  We have been able to catch up with his potassium
   depletion.  He is ambulating without difficulty.  Net volume removal
   has been in excess of 63 liters out.  He still has major centripetal
   obesity but the ascitic and edema contributions have been corrected.
   He will be discharged home today and will floowup in 1 or 2 weeks with
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9088**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9089**].  He will be sent home on torsemide 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], no
   metolazone;  he will also be taking spironolactone but we will also get
   rid of his Diamox.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9088**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9089**], NP from the HF section will keep
   close tabs on him.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid obesity, and a history of OSA. He was admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic CHF requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient had recurrent ventricular arrhythmias with ICD firing, which have now resolved. He is currently stable without symptoms.

Medical Complications:
1. Dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 15% and massively dilated LV.
2. Severe systolic CHF.
3. Massive fluid overload requiring aggressive diuresis.
4. Recurrent ventricular arrhythmias with ICD firing.
5. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) due to total body potassium depletion.
6. Acute renal failure with rising creatinine levels from 1.5 to 2.1.
7. Hyponatremia and hypochloremia (low sodium and chloride levels) due to intravasculary low volume triggering ADH.
8. Gout flare in the left big toe.
9. Diarrhea, which has improved.
10. Morbid obesity contributing to centripetal obesity.

Plan:
1. Continue Toprol XL 300mg and hold digoxin.
2. Check daily K/Mg"

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments: with patient, sister
   [**Name (NI) 36**] status: Full code
   Disposition: CCU for now, likely home today
","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%. He has morbid obesity and was admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient had recurrent ventricular arrhythmias with ICD firing but appears to have resolved. He has a history of OSA and is currently stable without symptoms.

Assessment and Plan:
1. RHYTHM: The patient had recent episodes of ICD firing, which were likely due to total body potassium depletion. No amiodarone at this time. Monitor daily K/Mg levels with a goal of high 4. Continue Toprol XL 300mg and stop digoxin.
2. PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient has been diuresed 62.4 liters. Now off milrinone, neosynephrine, and lasix drip. Continuing to diurese and have held diuretics for 24 hours due to renal failure. Restart Metolazone 5mg daily, Torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 7**], Aldactone 50mg daily, and Acetazolamide 250 daily now that fluid balance is less than net negative 2 liters. Hold lisinopril [**2-18**] due to low blood pressure and renal failure. Switch to daily Chem 7s. Replete Potassium PRN, Goal K of 4.5. Give KCl 40mEq po x 2 today to replete total body potassium. Monitor I/O.
3. Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Secondary to poor cardiac output. Creatinine on admission 1.5, now at 2.1 which is slowly improving over the last few days. Hold diuretics, as renal failure likely pre-renal in etiology, but will restart today. Continue to hold lisinopril at this time. Monitor Creatinine.
4. Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: Intravasculary low volume which triggers ADH; Developed slowly over the past 2 weeks on Lasix gtt. Stable over the past week. Acetazolamide mildly improved values. Continue to monitor and restart acetazolamide.
5. CORONARIES: No known CAD, no cath in past. Continue ASA.
6. Gout: Flare in left big toe. Stable today. Colchicine/tylenol as needed.
7. Diarrhea: Improved. Continue loperamide as needed.
8. OSA: Not on bipap at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severely decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (15%).
2. Arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, due to ICD firing.
3. Acute kidney injury due to pre-renal causes such as hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
4. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, due to diuretic use and ongoing losses.
5. Hyponatremia and hypochloremia due to intravasculary low volume and activation of ADH.
6. Gout flare in the left big toe.
7. OSA exacerbation without the use of bipap at home."
