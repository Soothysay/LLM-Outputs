   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk given hematochezia
   and signficant Hct drop. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex
   of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local
   epi injections and cauterization were performed. No other evidence for
   ulcer, gastritis. Lower GI bleed less likely given ERCP visualization
   of active bleed.
   - Place CVL
   - Intubated for ERCP, plan to extubate once CVL placed
   - Hct Q4H, transfuse with goal Hct>30 given acute ECG changes, although
   will need to be somewhat cautious given ESRD on HD and propensity for
   acute pulmonary edema
   - PPI IV bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Levofloxacin IV renally dosed x7days for biliary obstruction
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker givne hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat ECG
   # Hyperkalemia: K increasing, currently 5.7. Hold on further RBC
   transfusions for now. Check ECG, and if changes will given
   Ca/insulin/glucose/kayexalate. Follow Q6H. Plan for HD tomorrow.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets [**Hospital1 **], transfuse >50
   # ESRD on HD - Last HD on [**4-13**], plan for HD tomorrow if HD stable. Did
   not appear volume overloaded prior to intubation, but electrolytes are
   progressively worsening in the setting of RBC transfusions. Has R
   tunneled line.

   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk given hematochezia
   and signficant Hct drop. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex
   of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local
   epi injections and cauterization were performed. No other evidence for
   ulcer, gastritis. Lower GI bleed less likely given ERCP visualization
   of active bleed.
   - Placed CVL
   - Intubated for ERCP, plan to extubate today
   - Hct Q6H, transfuse with goal Hct>30 given acute ECG changes, low CVP,
   overall goal with transfusion is fluid resuscitation.  Will use MAP and
   CVP primarily to guide transfusion/fluids
   - PPI IV bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   #Hypotension.  Ddx includes most likely hypovolemic from blood loss
   with possible component of low forward flow in setting of cardiac
   demand ischemia, also on ddx is sepsis with GI source in setting of
   recent manipulation.
   -Continue pressors with goal MAP >60
   -IVF, blood for CVP >10
   -will increase abx coverage for possible sepsis to include better
   anaerobic coverage, will start flagyl and discuss with GI
   -Blood culture today.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - GI recs levaquin IV renally dosed for 7 day course, however would
   like to broaden in include flagyl to cover anaerobes
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   -Pt
s pancreatic enzymes and Alk phos have come down however in setting
   of repeat ERCP T. bili has doubled with interval increase in LFTs
   somewhat concerning for worsened obstruction after instrumentation.
   -trend LFTs
   -d/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # ESRD on HD - Last HD on [**4-13**], K has been increasing in setting of
   transfusions.  Given hemodynamic instability will need CVVH with goal
   net even.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusion
   -CVVH today
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate
   -renally dose meds
   #Respiratory failure. Intubated for respiratory protection in setting
   of ERCP, both pt and son are adamantly against prolonged intubation.
   -wean sedation and attempt to wean vent today as patient tolerates
   -d/w son his feeling on extubating if she is unstable and whether he
   would perfer to cautiously vs aggressively wean pt from vent.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital with cholangitis and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which resulted in active bleeding at the sphincterotomy site. The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. He also has thrombocytopenia, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection during the ERCP procedure but is planned to be extubated today. His respiratory status is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated. Other medical conditions include acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, and potential sepsis with a GI source. The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on continuous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to electrolyte imbalances. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has active bleeding at the sphincterotomy site, which may require further interventions such as tagged scan or angiography to control the bleeding.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, particularly in the setting of recent GI manipulation.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk given hematochezia
   and signficant Hct drop. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex
   of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local
   epi injections and cauterization were performed. No other evidence for
   ulcer, gastritis. Lower GI bleed less likely given ERCP visualization
   of active bleed.
   - Place CVL
   - Intubated for ERCP, plan to extubate once CVL placed
   - Hct Q4H, transfuse with goal Hct>30 given acute ECG changes, although
   will need to be somewhat cautious given ESRD on HD and propensity for
   acute pulmonary edema
   - PPI IV bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Levofloxacin IV renally dosed x7days for biliary obstruction
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker givne hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat ECG
   # Hyperkalemia: K increasing, currently 5.7. Hold on further RBC
   transfusions for now. Check ECG, and if changes will given
   Ca/insulin/glucose/kayexalate. Follow Q6H. Plan for HD tomorrow.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets [**Hospital1 **], transfuse >50
   # ESRD on HD - Last HD on [**4-13**], plan for HD tomorrow if HD stable. Did
   not appear volume overloaded prior to intubation, but electrolytes are
   progressively worsening in the setting of RBC transfusions. Has R
   tunneled line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with cholangitis after undergoing biliary stenting. The patient is now experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have low blood pressure, and their heart rhythm is normal. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a central venous line, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has significant hematochezia and a drop in hematocrit due to GI bleed. They require packed red blood cell transfusion with a goal hematocrit >30. There is a risk of acute pulmonary edema due to ESRD on HD.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has a history of cholangitis and recent ERCP with biliary stenting. There is a need for repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent NSTEMI: The patient has ischemic changes on ECG during hypotension due to GI bleeding. It is likely a demand event rather than unstable plaque. Hold ASA and Plavix due to bleeding.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was admitted with cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which resulted in a sphincterotomy bleed and subsequent hypotension and acute blood loss anemia.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is on mechanical ventilation for airway protection. She remains pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing hypotension, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is low, suggesting hypovolemia. There is also a concern for possible sepsis contribution. The patient's total blood count (TBC) shows a low platelet count (82 K/uL), which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other causes.

The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and there is a rising total bilirubin level, indicating ongoing cholangitis. Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes have improved after transfusion, but cardiac ischemia remains a concern. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Her respiratory status is unstable, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, and recent NSTEMI.
- She was admitted with cholangitis following a procedure called ERCP, which resulted in a sphincterotomy bleed and shock due to acute blood loss anemia.
- The patient has been in the ICU since admission and has experienced several complications.
- She required intubation for airway protection during ERCP, placement of a CVL and arterial line, and transfusion of blood products.
- The patient remains pressor-dependent and hypovolemic, with ongoing resuscitation efforts.
- She also has cholangitis, evidenced by rising total bilirubin levels.
- There are concerns about cardiac ischemia, as EKG changes improved after transfusion.
- The patient has ESRD and is on HD.
- Acute respiratory failure necessitated intubation.
- Thrombocytopenia is present, but the cause is unclear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion response. Close monitoring of hematocrit and continued transfusion may be necessary.
2. Shock/hypovolemic: The patient remains pressor-dependent and hypovolemic, indicating inadequate tissue perfusion. Continued resuscitation efforts, including fluid administration and pressor support, should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk given hematochezia
   and signficant Hct drop. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex
   of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local
   epi injections and cauterization were performed. No other evidence for
   ulcer, gastritis. Lower GI bleed less likely given ERCP visualization
   of active bleed.
   - Placed CVL
   - Intubated for ERCP, plan to extubate today
   - Hct Q6H, transfuse with goal Hct>30 given acute ECG changes, low CVP,
   overall goal with transfusion is fluid resuscitation.  Will use MAP and
   CVP primarily to guide transfusion/fluids
   - PPI IV bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   #Hypotension.  Ddx includes most likely hypovolemic from blood loss
   with possible component of low forward flow in setting of cardiac
   demand ischemia, also on ddx is sepsis with GI source in setting of
   recent manipulation.
   -Continue pressors with goal MAP >60
   -IVF, blood for CVP >10
   -will increase abx coverage for possible sepsis to include better
   anaerobic coverage, will start flagyl and discuss with GI
   -Blood culture today.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - GI recs levaquin IV renally dosed for 7 day course, however would
   like to broaden in include flagyl to cover anaerobes
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   -Pt
s pancreatic enzymes and Alk phos have come down however in setting
   of repeat ERCP T. bili has doubled with interval increase in LFTs
   somewhat concerning for worsened obstruction after instrumentation.
   -trend LFTs
   -d/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # ESRD on HD - Last HD on [**4-13**], K has been increasing in setting of
   transfusions.  Given hemodynamic instability will need CVVH with goal
   net even.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusion
   -CVVH today
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate
   -renally dose meds
   #Respiratory failure. Intubated for respiratory protection in setting
   of ERCP, both pt and son are adamantly against prolonged intubation.
   -wean sedation and attempt to wean vent today as patient tolerates
   -d/w son his feeling on extubating if she is unstable and whether he
   would perfer to cautiously vs aggressively wean pt from vent.

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital with cholangitis following a recent biliary stenting procedure. The patient now presents with gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Key Findings:
1. The patient has experienced acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleeding, likely at the ERPC site in the setting of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk bleeding was observed with hematochezia and significant Hct drop.
2. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local epi injections and cauterization were performed. No evidence for ulcer or gastritis.
3. The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with hypotension and low CVP. Ddx includes hypovolemia from blood loss with possible component of low forward flow in setting of cardiac demand ischemia, as well as sepsis with GI source in setting of recent manipulation.
4. The patient's platelet count is low, with persistent thrombocytopenia. Possible causes include DIC, zosyn, or other factors.
5. The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels, indicating potential worsening obstruction after instrumentation.
6. The patient has a history of recent NSTEMI and stent placement. E"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk given hematochezia
   and signficant Hct drop. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex
   of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local
   epi injections and cauterization were performed. No other evidence for
   ulcer, gastritis. Lower GI bleed less likely given ERCP visualization
   of active bleed.
   - Placed CVL
   - Intubated for ERCP, plan to extubate today
   - Hct Q6H, transfuse with goal Hct>30 given acute ECG changes, low CVP,
   overall goal with transfusion is fluid resuscitation.  Will use MAP and
   CVP primarily to guide transfusion/fluids
   - PPI IV bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   #Hypotension.  Ddx includes most likely hypovolemic from blood loss
   with possible component of low forward flow in setting of cardiac
   demand ischemia, also on ddx is sepsis with GI source in setting of
   recent manipulation.
   -Continue pressors with goal MAP >60
   -IVF, blood for CVP >10
   -will increase abx coverage for possible sepsis to include better
   anaerobic coverage, will start flagyl and discuss with GI
   -Blood culture today.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - GI recs levaquin IV renally dosed for 7 day course, however would
   like to broaden in include flagyl to cover anaerobes
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   -Pt
s pancreatic enzymes and Alk phos have come down however in setting
   of repeat ERCP T. bili has doubled with interval increase in LFTs
   somewhat concerning for worsened obstruction after instrumentation.
   -trend LFTs
   -d/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # ESRD on HD - Last HD on [**4-13**], K has been increasing in setting of
   transfusions.  Given hemodynamic instability will need CVVH with goal
   net even.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusion
   -CVVH today
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate
   -renally dose meds
   #Respiratory failure. Intubated for respiratory protection in setting
   of ERCP, both pt and son are adamantly against prolonged intubation.
   -wean sedation and attempt to wean vent today as patient tolerates
   -d/w son his feeling on extubating if she is unstable and whether he
   would perfer to cautiously vs aggressively wean pt from vent.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with cholangitis following a recent biliary stenting procedure. The patient now presents with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has been intubated for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's blood products have been transfused, but there is ongoing blood loss and a need for further transfusion. The patient's potassium levels are increasing, likely due to the transfusions, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is planned to manage the electrolyte imbalance and fluid overload. The patient's platelet count is low, possibly related to zosyn or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and there is concern for a cardiac event given the recent NSTEMI and unstable plaque in the coronary arteries.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has ongoing GI bleeding, leading to significant hematochezia and a drop in hematocrit (Hct) levels. This may result in acute blood loss anemia, which can cause hypotension and further exacerbate the patient's condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, possibly due to hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk given hematochezia
   and signficant Hct drop. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex
   of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local
   epi injections and cauterization were performed. No other evidence for
   ulcer, gastritis. Lower GI bleed less likely given ERCP visualization
   of active bleed.
   - Placed CVL
   - Intubated for ERCP, plan to extubate today
   - Hct Q6H, transfuse with goal Hct>30 given acute ECG changes, low CVP,
   overall goal with transfusion is fluid resuscitation.  Will use MAP and
   CVP primarily to guide transfusion/fluids
   - PPI IV bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   #Hypotension.  Ddx includes most likely hypovolemic from blood loss
   with possible component of low forward flow in setting of cardiac
   demand ischemia, also on ddx is sepsis with GI source in setting of
   recent manipulation.
   -Continue pressors with goal MAP >60
   -IVF, blood for CVP >10
   -will increase abx coverage for possible sepsis to include better
   anaerobic coverage, will start flagyl and discuss with GI
   -Blood culture today.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - GI recs levaquin IV renally dosed for 7 day course, however would
   like to broaden in include flagyl to cover anaerobes
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   -Pt
s pancreatic enzymes and Alk phos have come down however in setting
   of repeat ERCP T. bili has doubled with interval increase in LFTs
   somewhat concerning for worsened obstruction after instrumentation.
   -trend LFTs
   -d/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # ESRD on HD - Last HD on [**4-13**], K has been increasing in setting of
   transfusions.  Given hemodynamic instability will need CVVH with goal
   net even.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusion
   -CVVH today
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate
   -renally dose meds
   #Respiratory failure. Intubated for respiratory protection in setting
   of ERCP, both pt and son are adamantly against prolonged intubation.
   -wean sedation and attempt to wean vent today as patient tolerates
   -d/w son his feeling on extubating if she is unstable and whether he
   would perfer to cautiously vs aggressively wean pt from vent.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease status post non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He presented to the hospital with cholangitis following a recent biliary stenting procedure and is now experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient is currently intubated for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which revealed active bleeding at the sphincterotomy site. He has a low platelet count and has been taking aspirin, increasing the risk of bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 111/47 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is receiving IV fluids and blood transfusions to manage acute blood loss and maintain adequate hemoglobin levels. 

His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. He also has elevated troponin T levels, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia, but this could be due to the acute blood loss and hypotension. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Acute blood loss anemia due to GI bleed: The patient has experienced significant blood loss,"

   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   #Bacteremia. Potential sources HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently
   for IVF and pressors, also CVL/arterial line and ERCP manipulation.
   -continue levaquin for GI coverage after complicated ERCP
   -1g Vancomycin now, dosed with HD for GPC
   -follow up speciation and sensitivities of bacteria, adjust abx
   accordingly
   -draw cultures off all indwelling lines
   -make renal aware of new bacteremia and discuss plans regarding need to
   remove HD catheter
   -consider TTE followed by TEE to evaluate for endocarditis
   -daily surveillance cultures
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk given hematochezia
   and signficant Hct drop. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex
   of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local
   epi injections and cauterization were performed. No other evidence for
   ulcer, gastritis. Lower GI bleed less likely given ERCP visualization
   of active bleed.
   - Placed CVL
   - Has been receiving PRBCs for [**Last Name (LF) 2339**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give an additional
   unit this am with goal Hct >30 in setting of active CAD.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon
   - keep active T&S
   - PPI IV bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   #Hypotension.  Initially more of a hypovolemic shock picture, however
   was confusing initially as was persistently requiring pressors despite
   adequate fluid rescusitation.  Now with known bacteremia, presume that
   septic shock is more likely predominant factor.
   -Continue pressors with goal MAP >60
   -IVF, blood for CVP >10, will give blood as above for Hct goal >30
   -Will d/c flagyl as no known anaerobic source for infection and start
   -treat GPC bacteremia as above with vanc, follow cultures, hope that
   once bacteremia treated pt will tolerate weaning from pressors.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].

   of repeat ERCP T. bili has doubled with interval increase in LFTs
   somewhat concerning for worsened obstruction after instrumentation.
   -trend LFTs
   -d/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >30
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure

   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   - repeat DIC labs

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with cholangitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) complicated by sphincterotomy bleed. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been critically ill.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. GPC bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPC), and the healthcare team is considering the source of infection, which may include the hemodialysis line, left internal jugular central venous catheter (CVC), or gastrointestinal (GI) instrumentation. The plan is to change antibiotics to continue levofloxacin for a 7-day course and add vancomycin.

2. GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed, leading to acute blood loss anemia. The hemoglobin concentration responded appropriately to blood transfusion. Serial hemoglobin measurements will be monitored, and further transfusions will be given as necessary.

3. Shock, hypovolemic and septic: The patient remains pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing hypotension and potential septic shock. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has been ordered to increase the hemoglobin concentration"

The patient is on norepinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema and icterus, irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and anasarca (swelling) in both extremities. Neurological examination was not performed due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with cholangitis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient has developed a sphincterotomy leak and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). She is experiencing hypotension requiring vasopressors, severe hypoalbuminemia, bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci (GPC), and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated for airway protection during ERCP but now has normal respiratory status without supplemental oxygen. She also has thrombocytopenia with an unclear cause.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and low blood pressure may indicate a possible sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's critical illness and multiple organ involvement (respiratory, renal, cardiovascular), there is a risk of MODS, where dysfunction in one organ leads to dysfunction in other organs.
3. Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: The patient's recent ERCP and sphincterotomy leak increase the risk of GI bleeding, which can lead to significant"

   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   #Bacteremia. Potential sources HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently
   for IVF and pressors, also CVL/arterial line and GI tract from ERCP
   manipulation.
   -blood cultures growing VRE, consulted ID, formal consult in am, recs
   daptomycin for now.
   -have d/c
d vanc and levaquin
   -Cultures off HD line positive before CVL positive, suspect this line
   may be seeded.  D/w renal, plan to leave in for now.  Re-evaluate in
   am. Will likely need line holiday if persistently bacteremic on
   appropriate abx
   -TTE, ? vegetations, consider TEE
   -daily surveillance cultures
   -d/c a-line
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Has required 2 units a day
   PRBCs for past 3 days. Hct this am back to pre-tx Hct from night
   prior.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon, transfuse if below 28.
   - keep active T&S
   - PPI PO bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - epo with HD
   #Hypotension.  Initially more of a hypovolemic shock picture, however
   was confusing initially as was persistently requiring pressors despite
   adequate fluid rescusitation.  Now with known bacteremia, presume that
   septic shock is more likely predominant factor.  Interestingly is now
   off pressors despite persistent bacteremia on vancomycin for vancomycin
   resistant organism.  Potentially partially treated by levaquin.
   -continue daptomycin and d/c levaquin as above
   -off pressors
   -Continue to monitor SBP, goal MAP >60
   -caution with fluid removal with HD, although pt was able to tolerate
   2L removal today off pressors.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - GI recs levaquin IV renally dosed for 7 day course, have changed
   regimen as above
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   -T. bili elevated, although trending down for first time today.
   -trend LFTs
   -d/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >30
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   - repeat DIC labs showed no DIC.
   -other potential etiologies include bacteremia and medications,
   possibly levaquin which has been discontinued, and pantoprazole.
   Continue to monitor as bacteremia resolves, off levaquin.
   # ESRD on HD
 HD today, removed 2L.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusions
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD
   -renally dose meds, daptomycin is q48
   #Respiratory failure. Extubated, sating well on RA, resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   #Bacteremia. Potential sources HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently
   for IVF and pressors, also CVL/arterial line and ERCP manipulation.
   -continue levaquin for GI coverage after complicated ERCP
   -1g Vancomycin now, dosed with HD for GPC
   -follow up speciation and sensitivities of bacteria, adjust abx
   accordingly
   -draw cultures off all indwelling lines
   -make renal aware of new bacteremia and discuss plans regarding need to
   remove HD catheter
   -consider TTE followed by TEE to evaluate for endocarditis
   -daily surveillance cultures
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Brisk given hematochezia
   and signficant Hct drop. Repeat ERCP with active bleeding at the apex
   of the sphincterotomy site and overlying clot that was removed; local
   epi injections and cauterization were performed. No other evidence for
   ulcer, gastritis. Lower GI bleed less likely given ERCP visualization
   of active bleed.
   - Placed CVL
   - Has been receiving PRBCs for [**Last Name (LF) 2339**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give an additional
   unit this am with goal Hct >30 in setting of active CAD.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon
   - keep active T&S
   - PPI IV bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Maintain active type and crossmatch
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   #Hypotension.  Initially more of a hypovolemic shock picture, however
   was confusing initially as was persistently requiring pressors despite
   adequate fluid rescusitation.  Now with known bacteremia, presume that
   septic shock is more likely predominant factor.
   -Continue pressors with goal MAP >60
   -IVF, blood for CVP >10, will give blood as above for Hct goal >30
   -Will d/c flagyl as no known anaerobic source for infection and start
   -treat GPC bacteremia as above with vanc, follow cultures, hope that
   once bacteremia treated pt will tolerate weaning from pressors.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - GI recs levaquin IV renally dosed for 7 day course
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   -Pt
s pancreatic enzymes and Alk phos have come down however in setting
   of repeat ERCP T. bili has doubled with interval increase in LFTs
   somewhat concerning for worsened obstruction after instrumentation.
   -trend LFTs
   -d/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >30
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment. HIT antibody negative.
   Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on [**4-13**]).
   - Follow platelets, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   - repeat DIC labs
   # ESRD on HD
 HD today (on pressors), removed 1L.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusion
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate
   -renally dose meds
   #Respiratory failure. Extubated, sating well on RA, resolved.

She was transferred to the ICU for emergent ERCP with local bleeding control and is currently off pressors for 24 hours. The patient is bacteremic with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7째C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/47 to 137/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,994 mL and output of 1,000 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 994 mL. The patient's weight is currently 67 kg, and she has a height of 64 inches.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and amyloidosis, admitted to the ICU for cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. She experienced significant blood loss during the sphincterotomy, leading to hypovolemic shock, demand ischemia, and bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including metronidazole, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. She is currently hemodynamically stable, but continues to have thrombocytopenia, severe hypoalbuminemia, and anemia. The patient's medical history includes a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and cholangitis, for which she underwent ERCP with stent placement and gallstone extraction. The patient is on dialysis and tolerates oral intake. She has guaiac-positive stools, indicating possible ongoing bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VRE bacteremia: The patient is already bacteremic with VRE, which can lead to further infections if not properly managed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient's ongoing blood loss has resulted in anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.
4. Hypoalbuminemia: The"

   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses
   or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. No vegetation/mass is seen
   on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors, also CVL/arterial line. Blood cultures growing VRE,
   consulted ID.  Daptomycin started, renally dosed; ? of Linezolid in ID
   note pending sensitivities.
   - Have d/c
d vanc and levaquin, daptomycin started q48H
   - Cultures off HD line positive before CVL positive, suspect this line
   may be seeded.  D/w renal, plan to leave in for now.  ID recommending
   resiting, though given poor HD access, renal would like to leave it
   in.  A-line removed yesterday.
   - TTE showing no vegetations, can consider [**Last Name (LF) 1613**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] discuss with ID
   today
   -Daily surveillance cultures, continue to follow micro
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Has required 6 units of
   blood since admission. No blood products yesterday.  Hct this morning
   decreased from prior.
   - Will transfuse one unit pRBCs this morning. Check post-transfusion
   Hct. Transfuse if below 28.
   - Keep active T&S
   - PPI PO bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   # Hypotension.  Initially more of a hypovolemic shock picture, however
   was confusing initially as was persistently requiring pressors despite
   adequate fluid rescusitation.  Now with known bacteremia, presume that

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. She has experienced several complications including bacteremia, acute blood loss anemia, hypotension, cholangitis, thrombocytopenia, and respiratory failure. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and has had her lines and catheters removed. Her current condition includes persistently bacteremic with VRE, low blood pressure, and low platelet count. She is on hemodialysis and requires ongoing supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent bacteremia with VRE and hypotension suggest a potential risk for sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of ESRD and recent hemodialysis indicate a pre-existing kidney condition. The ongoing use of nephrotoxic medications, such as daptomycin, and potential complications from catheterization could further contribute to AKI.
3. Bleeding: The patient has experienced GI bleeding, possibly related to anticoagulant medications or recent ERCP procedure. This puts her at risk for further bleeding episodes.
4. Thrombocytopenia"

   stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. No vegetation/mass is seen
   on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors, also CVL/arterial line. Blood cultures growing VRE,
   consulted ID.  Daptomycin started, renally dosed; ? of Linezolid in ID
   note pending sensitivities.
   - Have d/c
d vanc and levaquin, daptomycin started q48H
   - Cultures off HD line positive before CVL positive, suspect this line
   may be seeded.  D/w renal, plan to leave in for now.  ID recommending
   resiting, though given poor HD access, renal would like to leave it
   in.  A-line removed yesterday.
   - TTE showing no vegetations, can consider [**Last Name (LF) 1613**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] discuss with ID
   today
   -Daily surveillance cultures, continue to follow micro
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERPC site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Has required 6 units of
   blood since admission. No blood products yesterday.  Hct this morning
   decreased from prior.
   - Will transfuse one unit pRBCs this morning. Check post-transfusion
   Hct. Transfuse if below 28.
   - Keep active T&S
   - PPI PO bid
   - If continued bleeding, will consider tagged scan or angio; may need
   colonoscopy to rule-out lower source
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   # Hypotension.  Initially more of a hypovolemic shock picture, however
   was confusing initially as was persistently requiring pressors despite
   adequate fluid rescusitation.  Now with known bacteremia, presume that
   septic shock is more likely predominant factor.  Interestingly is now
   off pressors despite persistent bacteremia on vancomycin for vancomycin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with cholangitis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and is now experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and has been started on daptomycin.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has been bleeding heavily, requiring 6 units of blood transfusions since admission. This could lead to further deterioration of his hemodynamic status and may necessitate ongoing blood product transfusions.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension, initially thought to be due to hypovolemic shock but now presumed to be septic shock secondary to bacteremia. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure are necessary.

3. Cholangitis: The patient had cholangitis after ERCP, and although stones were removed on a prior study, there is still an elevation in total bilirubin (Tbili). A repeat ERCP with stent removal is planned in 2 months. Close monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting now with GI bleed.
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.  Blood cultures growing VRE, consulted ID.
   Daptomycin started, renally dosed; Will change to Linezolid per ID.
   - Have d/c
d vanc and levaquin
   - Cultures off HD line positive before CVL positive, suspect this line
   may be seeded.  D/w renal, plan to leave in for now.  ID recommending
   resiting, though given poor HD access, renal would like to leave it
   in.
   - Will plan to get paired cultures today (one off HD line during
   dialysis and one peripherally to help determine if HD line is source to
   potentially avoid needing to remove line)
   - A-line removed yesterday
   - TTE showing no vegetations, can consider TEE though this will only
   help with determining length of treatment.  Will continue to discuss
   with ID
   -Daily surveillance cultures, continue to follow micro
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERCP site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Has required 6 units of
   blood since admission. No blood products yesterday.  Hct this morning
   decreased from prior.  Patient has not had report of guaiac positive
   stools since admission, though has not had a BM for 48 hours.
   Concerning that there is another source of bleeding given that her HCT
   continues to fall.  No e/o hemolysis.
   - Will transfuse one unit pRBCs this morning. Check post-transfusion
   Hct. Transfuse if below 28.
   - If pm Hct does not bump appropriately, will get CT abdomen to
   evaluate for other possible source
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Keep active T&C
   - PPI PO bid
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib as of this morning.
   Became transiently hypotensive with high rates not responsive to fluid
   bolus.  Potential causes include high grade bacteremia, hypotension,
   ischemia though this is less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated
   due to ongoing bleed.
   - Will plan to PO amio load patient this morning, will keep a close eye
   on patient
s blood pressures as she has had MAPs around 55-60
   overnight.
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on
   [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
d [**4-20**].
   Most likely due to sepsis, though may also be due to pantoprazole which
   can rarely cause this (<1%).
   - Follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] today, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # Hypotension.  Initially more of a hypovolemic shock picture, however
   was confusing initially as was persistently requiring pressors despite
   adequate fluid rescusitation.  Now with known bacteremia, presume that
   septic shock is more likely predominant factor.  Now off pressors >48H
   despite persistent bacteremia. Has required two small fluid boluses
   over the last 24 hours for low BPs.
   - Continue Linezolid as above
   - Continue to monitor SBP, CVP, IVF vs. blood based on CVP/Hct
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Linezolid as above as VRE likely from GI source
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - T. bili elevated, although trending down now over last 2 days
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - D/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
 HD today, removed 2kg UF yesterday.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusions
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD
   -renally dose meds, daptomycin is q48
   #Respiratory failure. Extubated, sating well on RA, resolved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital with cholangitis after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), acute blood loss anemia, atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, and cholangitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is bacteremic with VRE and has a history of cholangitis. There is a concern for ongoing infection in the GI tract and the possibility of further complications related to bacteremia.

2. Bleeding: The patient has ongoing GI bleeding, which has resulted in acute blood loss anemia. It is important to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and continue blood product transfusions as needed to maintain adequate blood volume and oxygen-carrying capacity.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and recent NSTEMI. Atrial fibrillation has developed, and there is a concern for possible ischemia or plaque instability contributing to hypotension and further cardiac events.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be related to sepsis, medications (such as lev"

   adequate fluid rescusitation.  Now with known bacteremia, presume that
   septic shock is more likely predominant factor.  Now off pressors >48H
   despite persistent bacteremia. Has required two small fluid boluses
   over the last 24 hours for low BPs.
   - Continue Linezolid as above
   - Continue to monitor SBP, CVP, IVF vs. blood based on CVP
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Linezolid as above as VRE likely from GI source
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - T. bili elevated, although trending down now over last 2 days
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - D/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
 HD today, removed 2kg UF yesterday.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusions
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital with cholangitis after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding and bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). He is also thrombocytopenic, hypotensive, and has a history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and recent restart of aspirin may have contributed to the bleeding. It is important to monitor for any signs of ongoing bleeding and continue to transfuse blood products as needed.

2. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia with VRE, which could lead to sepsis. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to sepsis, medication side effects, or other factors. Close monitoring of platelet levels and transfusion if below 50,000/mm3 is recommended.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation, suggesting possible septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment of fluid status are"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo F w/amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, recent NSTEMI w/cholangitis s/p ERCP
   with multiple stents c/b sphincterotomy bleed.  VRE bacteremia.  Severe
   hypoalbuminemia. New atrial fibrillation.
   VRE bacteremia - likely [**1-29**] GI instrumentation, also possibly due to HD
   catheter.
   Hemodynamically stable
   Started on daptomycin, but will be changed to linezolid.
   Renal service wants to treat through, but I believe HD line needs to be
   re-sited- will discuss with ID
   follow surveillance cxs daily.
   Will need TEE.
   ESRD
   HD today
   Anemia
   Continues to drop hct. No e/o overt bleeding though stools guaiac
   positive.
   If hct not stable on 4pm check, will obtain abd CT to determine source
   of bleed- procedure vs other.
   Thrombocytopenia
   No e/o DIC, not getting any heparin products (gets citrate w/HD)
   Unclear etiology: infection vs. med related (was on zosyn- d/c 1 wk
   ago, levofloxacin, which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, was stopped
   yesterday)
   HIT Ab negative
   Other meds: pantoprazole, but plts dropped prior to that med and very
   rarely respiridone (<0.1% reported).
   Likely due to sepsis
   Afib
   Rhythm is unstable- would probably be easily corrected with Amio.
   Though she may stabilize in sinus with treatment of infection, she did
   become hypotensive when her rate was fast and will not tolerate high
   volume of boluses, so will treat with amio, though she may not require
   it long term.
   FEN
   Tolerating POs
   Cholangitis - TBili improving, will observe ALT/AST given increase
   today.  Needs rpt ERCP for stent removal in 2 mos.
   CAD
   Holding ASA, betablocker, plavix, statin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with cholangitis post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), multiple stents, sphincterotomy bleed, and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has several medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is dropping, indicating ongoing blood loss. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of bleeding.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to fluid loss, sepsis, or cardiac issues. Fluid boluses have been given, but the patient remains hypotensive. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, characterized by an irregular heartbeat. This condition needs to be addressed promptly to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear,"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo F w/amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, recent NSTEMI w/cholangitis s/p ERCP
   with multiple stents c/b sphincterotomy bleed.  VRE bacteremia.  Severe
   hypoalbuminemia. New atrial fibrillation.
   VRE bacteremia - likely [**1-29**] GI instrumentation, also possibly due to HD
   catheter.
   Hemodynamically stable
   Started on daptomycin, but will be changed to linezolid.
   Renal service wants to treat through, but I believe HD line needs to be
   re-sited- will discuss with ID
   follow surveillance cxs daily.
   Will need TEE.
   ESRD
   HD today
   Anemia
   Continues to drop hct. No e/o overt bleeding though stools guaiac
   positive.
   If hct not stable on 4pm check, will obtain abd CT to determine source
   of bleed- procedure vs other.
   Thrombocytopenia
   No e/o DIC, not getting any heparin products (gets citrate w/HD)
   Unclear etiology: infection vs. med related (was on zosyn- d/c 1 wk
   ago, levofloxacin, which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, was stopped
   yesterday)
   HIT Ab negative
   Other meds: pantoprazole, but plts dropped prior to that med and very
   rarely respiridone (<0.1% reported).
   Likely due to sepsis
   Afib
   Rhythm is unstable- would probably be easily corrected with Amio.
   Though she may stabilize in sinus with treatment of infection, she did
   become hypotensive when her rate was fast and will not tolerate high
   volume of boluses, so will treat with amio, though she may not require
   it long term.
   FEN
   Tolerating POs
   Cholangitis - TBili improving, will observe ALT/AST given increase
   today.  Needs rpt ERCP for stent removal in 2 mos.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with cholangitis post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), multiple stents placed due to sphincterotomy bleed, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. She is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, severe hypoalbuminemia, and anemia with blood loss. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and altered mental status. Her blood culture was positive for VRE. She has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) instrumentation and is on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and altered mental status suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can be caused by the VRE bacteremia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of ESRD and recent HD may predispose her to AKI, especially if there are complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or contrast-induced nephropathy.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may indicate thrombocytopenia, which can be caused by se"

   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.
   - appreciate ID recs. Will cont on linezolid for now while awaiting
   dapto sensitivities;  monitor plts
   - culture HD/peripheral today.  Will place new CVL over wire today. d/w
   IR re changing HD catheter if possible
   - TTE showing no vegetations, can consider TEE though this will only
   help with determining length of treatment.  Will continue to discuss
   with ID
   -Daily surveillance cultures, continue to follow micro
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Patient has not had report of guaiac
   positive stools since admission, though has not had a BM for 4 days.
   Concerning that there is another source of bleeding given that her HCT
   continues to fall.  No e/o hemolysis.
   - repeat HCT this PM, if continues to decrease, will give 1 unit prbc
   and CT abdomen to evaluate for bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PPI PO bid
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - amio loading in progress. Monitor LFTs- slightly elevated. If
   continues to increase, will need to stop amio
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on
   [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
d [**4-20**].
   Most likely due to sepsis, though may also be due to pantoprazole which
   can rarely cause this (<1%).
   -          transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   -          Monitor closely on linezolid.
   # HypotensionNow with known bacteremia, presume that septic shock is
   more likely predominant factor. Now stable
   - Continue Linezolid as above
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Linezolid as above as VRE likely from GI source
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - T. bili elevated, although trending down. Transaminases up today;
   will plan for RUQ US to eval for any infectious source
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
 HD today- monitor BP on HD and monitor amount of fluid
   removal
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with cholangitis following biliary stenting and subsequently developed gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation (a.fib).

The patient has experienced several medical complications during their stay in the ICU. These include:

1. Bacteremia: The most likely source of bacteremia is the GI tract from ERCP manipulation. Other potential sources include the HD catheter, especially since it was accessed emergently for intravenous fluid (IVF) and pressors. The patient is currently being treated with linezolid for VRE bacteremia.

2. Acute blood loss anemia: Despite not having a reported guaiac-positive stool since admission, the patient's hematocrit (Hct) continues to fall. This raises concern for another source of bleeding. No evidence of hemolysis is observed. The plan is to repeat Hct this afternoon, and if it continues to decrease, the patient will receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells (prbc) and undergo CT abdomen to evaluate for bleeding. The patient will also have guaiac all stools, be placed on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) twice daily, have all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants held, and receive epo with HD.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Potential causes include high-grade bacteremia, hypotension, and ischemia, although this is less likely. The patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed. A loading dose of amiodarone is being given, and the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) should be monitored. If LFTs continue to increase, amiodarone may need to be stopped. As infection improves, a.fib may resolve, and amiodarone may be discontinued after a few days of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia despite treatment for cholangitis. Initially, there was concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but repeat DIC labs were negative. HIT antibody is also negative. Possible causes of thrombocytopenia include sepsis, medication (such as pantoprazole), or zosyn (dc'd on 4/13). The patient will be closely monitored on linezolid, and transfused if platelet count drops below 50 and they are actively bleeding.

5. Hypotension: The patient now has known bacteremia and presumed septic shock. Hypotension is likely the predominant factor. The patient"

   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting c/b GI bleed now with VRE bacteremia,
   and new a.fib
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.  Blood cultures growing VRE, consulted ID.
   Daptomycin started, renally dosed; Will change to Linezolid per ID.
   - Have d/c
d vanc and levaquin
   - Cultures off HD line positive before CVL positive, suspect this line
   may be seeded.  D/w renal, plan to leave in for now.  ID recommending
   resiting, though given poor HD access, renal would like to leave it
   in.
   - Will plan to get paired cultures today (one off HD line during
   dialysis and one peripherally to help determine if HD line is source to
   potentially avoid needing to remove line)
   - A-line removed yesterday
   - TTE showing no vegetations, can consider TEE though this will only
   help with determining length of treatment.  Will continue to discuss
   with ID
   -Daily surveillance cultures, continue to follow micro
   # Acute blood loss anemia: GI bleed likely at ERCP site in the setting
   of low platelets and recent restart of ASA. Has required 6 units of
   blood since admission. No blood products yesterday.  Hct this morning
   decreased from prior.  Patient has not had report of guaiac positive
   stools since admission, though has not had a BM for 48 hours.
   Concerning that there is another source of bleeding given that her HCT
   continues to fall.  No e/o hemolysis.
   - Will transfuse one unit pRBCs this morning. Check post-transfusion
   Hct. Transfuse if below 28.
   - If pm Hct does not bump appropriately, will get CT abdomen to
   evaluate for other possible source
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Keep active T&C
   - PPI PO bid
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib as of this morning.
   Became transiently hypotensive with high rates not responsive to fluid
   bolus.  Potential causes include high grade bacteremia, hypotension,
   ischemia though this is less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated
   due to ongoing bleed.
   - Will plan to PO amio load patient this morning, will keep a close eye
   on patient
s blood pressures as she has had MAPs around 55-60
   overnight.
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on
   [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
d [**4-20**].
   Most likely due to sepsis, though may also be due to pantoprazole which
   can rarely cause this (<1%).
   - Follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] today, transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # Hypotension.  Initially more of a hypovolemic shock picture, however
   was confusing initially as was persistently requiring pressors despite
   adequate fluid rescusitation.  Now with known bacteremia, presume that
   septic shock is more likely predominant factor.  Now off pressors >48H
   despite persistent bacteremia. Has required two small fluid boluses
   over the last 24 hours for low BPs.
   - Continue Linezolid as above
   - Continue to monitor SBP, CVP, IVF vs. blood based on CVP/Hct
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Linezolid as above as VRE likely from GI source
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - T. bili elevated, although trending down now over last 2 days
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - D/w GI need for further imaging.
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker gived hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Trended cardiac enzymes, trop elevated but stable in setting of renal
   failure
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
 HD today, removed 2kg UF yesterday.
   -f/u renal recs
   -EKG if K >6
   -check K after transfusions
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD
   -renally dose meds, daptomycin is q48
   #Respiratory failure. Extubated, sating well on RA, resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease status post non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He presented to the hospital with cholangitis following an ERCP procedure, which was complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been stabilized, but continues to face several medical complications. These include bacteremia likely originating from the GI tract or the hemodialysis catheter, acute blood loss anemia due to ongoing bleeding, thrombocytopenia possibly related to sepsis or medication, hypotension initially attributed to hypovolemic shock but now presumed to be septic shock, cholangitis with biliary obstruction, and a history of recent NSTEMI with possible stent placement.

Plan:
The patient's management plan involves addressing each of these complications. For bacteremia, daptomycin has been started and will be changed to linezolid as advised by the infectious disease consultant. Blood cultures will be obtained from both the hemodialysis line and peripheral sites to determine the source of infection and potentially avoid removing the hemodialysis line. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be considered to evaluate for endocarditis, particularly if the bacteremia persists.

Regarding the acute blood loss anemia, the patient has"

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He presented to the hospital with cholangitis following biliary stenting and is now experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has VRE bacteremia, which may be due to the manipulation of the GI tract during ERCP or possibly from the hemodialysis catheter. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and consider changing the hemodialysis catheter if it is identified as the source of infection.
2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss due to GI bleeding, requiring multiple transfusions. There is concern for another source of bleeding given the ongoing decrease in hematocrit levels. Further evaluation, including a CT scan of the abdomen and surveillance of stools for blood, is necessary to identify the source of bleeding.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed carefully due to the risk of thromboembolism. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary, but this must be balanced against the ongoing bleeding risk."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with cholangitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), multiple stents placed with subsequent bleeding, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient also has severe hypoalbuminemia and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with VRE bacteremia, which is likely due to recent gastrointestinal instrumentation or possibly due to the hemodialysis catheter. The patient is currently on linezolid, and pending sensitivities may change back to daptomycin if sensitive. Blood cultures are negative, indicating a potential improvement in the bacteremia. However, the patient requires daily surveillance cultures and a 2-week course of antibiotics once the blood cultures are definitively cleared. If blood cultures remain positive after stopping antibiotics, the hemodialysis line needs to be re-sited.

2. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management, including hemodialysis. The patient will receive hemodialysis today.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been appropriately transfused to maintain an adequate level. However, the patient's stools are"

   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting c/b GI bleed now with VRE bacteremia,
   and new a.fib
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.
   - appreciate ID recs. Will cont on linezolid for now while awaiting
   dapto sensitivities;  monitor plts
   - culture HD/peripheral today.  Will place new CVL over wire today. d/w
   IR re changing HD catheter if possible
   - TTE showing no vegetations, can consider TEE though this will only
   help with determining length of treatment.  Will continue to discuss
   with ID
   -Daily surveillance cultures, continue to follow micro
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Patient has not had report of guaiac
   positive stools since admission, though has not had a BM for 4 days.
   Concerning that there is another source of bleeding given that her HCT
   continues to fall.  No e/o hemolysis.
   - repeat HCT this PM, if continues to decrease, will give 1 unit prbc
   and CT abdomen to evaluate for bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PPI PO bid
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - amio loading in progress. Monitor LFTs- slightly elevated. If
   continues to increase, will need to stop amio
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on
   [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
d [**4-20**].
   Most likely due to sepsis, though may also be due to pantoprazole which
   can rarely cause this (<1%).
   -   transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   -  Monitor closely on linezolid.
   # HypotensionNow with known bacteremia, presume that septic shock is
   more likely predominant factor. Now stable
   - Continue Linezolid as above
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Linezolid as above as VRE likely from GI source
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - T. bili elevated, although trending down. Transaminases up today;
   will plan for RUQ US to eval for any infectious source
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with cholangitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and had a biliary stent placed. Subsequently, the patient experienced a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and developed VRE bacteremia and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 80s and 90s after hemodialysis. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm but with intermittent atrial fibrillation on telemetry.

The patient's physical examination reveals a right neck hematoma, murmurs, and decreased breath sounds at the bases of the lungs. The abdomen is soft and hypoactive, with minimal tenderness to palpation. The patient has pitting edema in the upper extremities but no lower extremity swelling. The skin is warm, dry, scaly, and jaundiced. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented, moving all extremities, and pleasant.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals a heterogeneous mass in the left lobe of the liver, suggestive of a liver abscess, as well as ascites and ech"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented to the hospital with cholangitis after undergoing biliary stenting and subsequently experienced a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is now diagnosed with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

24-hour events:
- Fistulogram done
- Left internal jugular (IJ) replaced over guidewire
- Hemodialysis (HD) in the morning
- Blood pressure in the 80s and 90s for the most part after HD
- Right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound showed possible liver abscess, recommended CT to further evaluate
- Discussed with Radiology, who wanted to hold off one day for another contrast load since the patient won't get dialyzed until Monday
- Recommended doing the CT on Saturday

Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has VRE bacteremia, likely from the GI tract due to recent ERCP manipulation or possibly from the hemodialysis catheter. ID recommendations include continuing linezolid, monitoring platelets, and obtaining cultures from the hemodialysis lines and peripheral blood.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting c/b GI bleed now with VRE bacteremia,
   and new a.fib
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.
   - appreciate ID recs. VRE sensitive to daptomycin.  Will restart today
   at endocarditis doses (6mg/kg) Q48.
   - Cultures negative x 2 days. Continue to monitor and check daily
   surveillance cultures.
   - TTE showing no vegetations, can consider TEE though this will only
   help with determining length of treatment.  Will continue to discuss
   with ID
   -discussed with renal need to change HD line when pt goes down for
   fistulogram on  [**Month/Year (2) 570**], they see no complelling need as pt has cleared
   bacteremia and as line unlikely to be source, but are not against.
   -trend CKs while on daptomycin
   -had CVL changed over wire yesterday, a-line d/c
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt has required total of 8 units of PRBCs, 1
   unit platelets since transfer to ICU on [**4-17**].  She had acute HCT drop
   after ERCP with nadir of 19, associated with EKG changes.  Underwent
   subsequent repeat ERCP with removal of clot from sphincter and cautery
   of bleeding. Tx requirement has trended down over past 6 days, but Hct
   does continue to trend down over time.  Report of guaiac positive
   stools this am.  Possible sources of ongoing bleed include hepatic mass
   seen on RUQ u/s and from ERCP site.
   - tx 1 unit PRBCs and 1 unit platelets today, tx goal Hct >28 and Plt
   >50 if bleeding, continue to check [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PPI PO bid
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   - CT abd with contrast today to further evaluate bleeding source.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - amio loading in progress. Monitor LFTs- trending down.
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.  Has stayed in sinus during day today.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on
   [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
d [**4-20**].
   Most likely due to sepsis, though may also be due to pantoprazole which
   can rarely cause this (<1%).
   -   transfuse >50 if actively bleeding, will receive 1 unit today for
   plt 48 in setting of ongoing Hct drop
   -   repeat DIC labs in am
   # Hypotension.  Ddx is hypovolemia vs sepsis.  Pt fluid positive every
   day, anuric, unlikely volume deplete.  Sepsis probably more predominant
   picture in setting of bacteremia. BP more stable today, no requirement
   for boluses other than transfusion in am.
   - Continue abx as above
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD, may require CVVH if BP remains
   low.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE likely from GI source
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - T. bili elevated, although trending down.   Transaminases trending
   down. Were transiently elevated yesterday, got RUQ u/s which showed
   concerning left lobe liver mass.  Follow up CT abd today with contrast
   to further evaluate
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
 HD planned for [**Last Name (LF) 570**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need CVVH if BP low.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with cholangitis following an emergency room catheterization procedure (ERCP). The patient developed a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and was found to have vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. He also has new-onset atrial fibrillation (afib).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 80s and 90s. He has received 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of platelets since admission. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 29.1% to 26.8% due to ongoing blood loss. The patient's platelet count is low at 51, and he has a history of thrombocytopenia possibly related to sepsis or medication use.

The patient has an indwelling dialysis catheter and underwent a fistulogram with replacement of the internal jugular (IJ) vein. His fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload. He is receiving hemodialysis and has a planned session on [**Last Name (LF) 570**].

Imaging studies reveal a heterogeneous mass in the left lobe of the liver measuring 83 x 74 x 77 mm, which is concerning for a liver abscess. There is also evidence of biliary stenting and ascites. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

The patient's medical team is considering a CT abdomen with contrast to further evaluate the bleeding source and a repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months. The patient is being treated with daptomycin for VRE bacteremia and pantoprazole for GI bleed prophylaxis. He is also receiving other medications such as amiodarone for afib, epo for anemia, and calcium acetate for hyperphosphatemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver abscess: The heterogeneous mass in the left lobe of the liver may lead to complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, sepsis, or rupture.
2. GI bleed: The ongoing blood loss from the GI tract can result in hypotension, acute blood loss anemia, or further deterioration of the patient's condition.
3. VRE bacteremia: The presence of VRE in the bloodstream can lead to sepsis or endocarditis if not promptly treated with appropriate antibiotics.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the context of ongoing GI bleeding.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can be due to hypovolem"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female with amyloidosis, CAD and ESRD presenting with
   cholangisits and now with VRE bacteremia and PAF.  She has had some
   recurrence and persistence of hypotension in past 24 hours without
   clear source to date.   Of note she has had identification of hepatic
   finding concerning for abscess at this time which will require further
   investigation.
   1)Sepsis-Likely VRE source from enteral source
   -Daptomycin to continue
   -Goal is the change HD line as soon as is possible
   -TTE negative
   -Will get CT abd to evaluate hepatic findings better and will pursue
   with relative HD stability this afternoon.
   2)Anemia
secondary to blood loss
   -Tranfusion requirement QOD
   -Goal HCT is 30 (ECG changes at 19)
   -PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -CT Abd today for alternative reasons but will assess RP bleed
   possibility.
   3)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Paroxysmal
   -Does likely contribute to the intermittent hypotension
   -Considering Amiodarone loading but patient is reluctant
will have to
   discuss with patient and agree on management plan.
   4)Thrombocytopenia
   -HIT negative, follow and will transfuse for <50
   -DIC negative
   5)Hypotension-
   -Is related to hypovolemia most likely
   -Could evaluate alternative sources of vasodilatory compromise
   (Cortisol, TSH) as abscess/bacteremia may be complete answer.
   -EF preserved on recent studies
   -Evidence of biliary obstruction is certainly improving
   6)ESRD-
   -HD Monday
   -Hope to move toward catheter replacement is possible after dialysis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of amyloidosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She presented with cholangitis and is now diagnosed with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents (PAF). The patient has experienced some recurrence and persistence of hypotension in the past 24 hours without a clear source. There is also identification of hepatic findings concerning for an abscess, which requires further investigation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Sepsis - The patient's sepsis is likely due to a VRE source from an enteral source. Daptomycin will continue to be administered, and a goal is to change the hemodialysis (HD) line as soon as possible. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) was negative, and a CT abdomen will be performed to evaluate the hepatic findings better.
2) Anemia - The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss. Transfusion requirements will be every other day (QOD), with a goal hematocrit (HCT) of 30. ECG changes at 19% will be monitored, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy will be initiated. A CT abdomen will be done today for alternative reasons but will also assess the possibility of right pleural effusion (RP) bleed.

   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.
   - appreciate ID recs. VRE sensitive to daptomycin.  Will restart today
   at endocarditis doses (6mg/kg) Q48.
   - Cultures negative x 2 days. Continue to monitor and check daily
   surveillance cultures.
   - TTE showing no vegetations, can consider TEE though this will only
   help with determining length of treatment.  Will continue to discuss
   with ID
   -discussed with renal need to change HD line when pt goes down for
   fistulogram on  [**Month/Year (2) 570**], they see no complelling need as pt has cleared
   bacteremia and as line unlikely to be source, but are not against.
   -trend CKs while on daptomycin
   -had CVL changed over wire yesterday, a-line d/c
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt has required total of 8 units of PRBCs, 1
   unit platelets since transfer to ICU on [**4-17**].  She had acute HCT drop
   after ERCP with nadir of 19, associated with EKG changes.  Underwent
   subsequent repeat ERCP with removal of clot from sphincter and cautery
   of bleeding. Tx requirement has trended down over past 6 days, but Hct
   does continue to trend down over time.  Report of guaiac positive
   stools this am.  Possible sources of ongoing bleed include hepatic mass
   seen on RUQ u/s and from ERCP site.
   - tx 1 unit PRBCs and 1 unit platelets today, tx goal Hct >28 and Plt
   >50 if bleeding, continue to check [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PPI PO bid
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   - CT abd with contrast today to further evaluate bleeding source.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - amio loading in progress. Monitor LFTs- trending down.
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.  Has stayed in sinus during day today.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd on
   [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
d [**4-20**].
   Most likely due to sepsis, though may also be due to pantoprazole which
   can rarely cause this (<1%).
   -   transfuse >50 if actively bleeding, will receive 1 unit today for
   plt 48 in setting of ongoing Hct drop
   -   repeat DIC labs in am
   # Hypotension.  Ddx is hypovolemia vs sepsis.  Pt fluid positive every
   day, anuric, unlikely volume deplete.  Sepsis probably more predominant
   picture in setting of bacteremia. BP more stable today, no requirement
   for boluses other than transfusion in am.
   - Continue abx as above
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD, may require CVVH if BP remains
   low.
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE likely from GI source
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - T. bili elevated, although trending down.   Transaminases trending
   down. Were transiently elevated yesterday, got RUQ u/s which showed
   concerning left lobe liver mass.  Follow up CT abd today with contrast
   to further evaluate
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with cholangitis after undergoing biliary stenting. The patient experienced a gastrointestinal bleed and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The patient's blood counts are low, and he has been transfused with red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets. He has been treated with daptomycin for endocarditis coverage. The patient has a large bilobed exophytic mass extending to the diaphragm and compressing the spleen, with evidence of slow venous bleed. His liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, and he has a history of recent NSTEMI and stent placement. The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) and requires ongoing management for his various conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Further bleeding: The patient has experienced significant blood loss due to gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a possibility of recurrent bleeding, especially if the source is not identified and addressed promptly.
2. Infection: The patient has bacteremia with VRE, which can lead to further infections if not effectively managed with appropriate antibiotics. Additionally, the patient's immun"

   VRE bacteremia, and new a.fib
   24 Hour Events:
   -got platelets and 1 unit prbcs, did not bump, on recheck at 9pm had
   improved 26.8 -->27.6 --> 29.1, 48-->42 -->59
   -redosed daptomycin for endocarditis coverage
   -ID recs: close monitoring of right THR warranted in setting of
   bactermia, recommend plain films and possible ortho eval in near
   future.  Monitor CK while on daptomycin.
   -renal concerned with how fluid positive pt is, recommend having a
   lower tolerated MAP and avoiding excess fluids (i.e. d/c KVO)
   -CT abd d/w radiology attending: large bilobed exophytic mass extending
   to diaphragm and compressing spleen, evidence of 'slow venous bleed'
   without evidence for venous extravasation.  Called IR, do not feel
   intervention warranted as pt is hemodynamically stable, recommend
   elective procedure for possible biopsy on [**Month/Year (2) 570**].  Will intervene if pt
   becomes unstable or has precipitous HCT drop.
   -records faxed from OSH ([**Location (un) **]), CT abd from [**2185-3-31**] showed no evidence
   of hepatic mass.

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Bilobed hypervascular exophytic left hepatic lobe mass with
   perihepatic
   blood, possibly represents venous oozing, in the absence of active
   extravasation on contrast enhanced images.
   2. Bilateral atrophic kidneys with perinephric stranding.
   3. Extensive ascites, large bilateral pleural effusion and generalized
   anasarca.
   Assessment and Plan
   75F h/o amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p NSTEMI ([**3-5**]) presented to OSH
   cholangitis s/p biliary stenting c/b GI bleed now with VRE bacteremia,
   and new a.fib
   #Liver mass.  Impressive exophytic mass present in left lobe of liver
   with evidence of slow bleed.  Given that this mass was not noted on OSH
   CT abd report from [**2185-3-31**], more likely this is related to her recent
   cholangitis and instrumentation rather than a neoplastic process.  Ddx
   includes abscess, hematoma with loculations, biloma or a complex
   combination of the former.  Presence of hemorrhagic mass partially
   explains pt
s persistently falling Hct and transfusion requirement.
   -IR aware, willing to pursue dx procedure, code status would need to be
   temporarily reversed.  D/w pt and son.  [**Name (NI) 1204**] need for multiple
   procedures for tomorrow will tentatively plan for Tuesday.  Check coags
   and have NPO after MN on [**Name (NI) 570**] night.
   -If pt or IR feel bx not an option, more conservative measure is repeat
   CT in 1 week to eval if collection is less attenuated, more liquefied
   and amenable to percutaneous drain
   -appreciate ID input, f/u with them re broadening coverage to  include
   gram negatives and anaerobes in setting of likely abdominal abscess.
   -Call IR for embolization should be become unstable or have large HCT
   drop.
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.
   - appreciate ID recs. VRE sensitive to daptomycin.  Will restart today
   at endocarditis doses (6mg/kg) Q48.
   - Cultures negative x 2 days. Continue to monitor and check daily
   surveillance cultures.
   - TTE showing no vegetations, treating endocarditis dose and at this
   point will need very prolonged course of abx in setting of possible
   abscess.   Consider eval for PICC placement
   -discussed with renal need to change HD line when pt goes down for
   fistulogram on  [**Name (NI) 570**], they see no complelling need as pt has cleared
   bacteremia and as line unlikely to be source, but are not against, will
   touch base with IR and plan to change HD line over wire tomorrow
   -NPO after MN tonight for fistulogram
   -trend CKs while on daptomycin, low this am.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt has required total of 8 units of PRBCs, 1
   unit platelets since transfer to ICU on [**4-17**].  She had acute HCT drop
   after ERCP with nadir of 19, associated with EKG changes.  Underwent
   subsequent repeat ERCP with removal of clot from sphincter and cautery
   of bleeding. Tx requirement has trended down over past 6 days, but Hct
   does continue to trend down over time.  Report of guaiac positive
   stools yesterday.  Possible sources of ongoing bleed include hepatic
   mass seen on CT and from ERCP site.
   - Did bump  to transfusion last night, hct and platelets stable today.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PPI PO bid
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   - PM hct/platelet check
   - call IR if pt becomes unstable as above, if pt bleeds at this point
   it is likely from mass.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - Responded well to amio, has been in sinus. Continue amiodarone for
   now.
   - Monitor LFTs- trending down.
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.  Has stayed in sinus during day today.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative x 3.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd
   on [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
   [**4-20**].  Most likely due to sepsis/critical illness and liver mass with
   possible splenic sequestration,  though may also be due to pantoprazole
   which can rarely cause this (<1%).
   -   transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # Hypotension.  Ddx is hypovolemia vs sepsis.  Pt fluid positive every
   day, anuric, unlikely volume deplete.  Sepsis probably more predominant
   picture in setting of bacteremia. BP more stable today, no requirement
   for boluses other than transfusion in am.
   - Continue abx as above
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD, may require CVVH if BP remains
   low.
   - Map goal >55
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE likely from GI source, broaded coverage
   per ID recs as above
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - T. bili elevated, although trending down.   Transaminases trending
   down. Were transiently elevated yesterday, got RUQ u/s which showed
   concerning left lobe liver mass.  Follow up CT abd today with contrast
   to further evaluate
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
 HD planned for [**Last Name (LF) 570**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need CVVH if BP low.
   -f/u renal recs, rec minimizing fluid, are concerned with degree of
   pt
s fluid overload.  Rec d/c KVO.
   -EKG if K >6
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital with cholangitis following biliary stenting. He is now experiencing a gastrointestinal bleed, bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and new-onset atrial fibrillation. The patient's recent blood transfusions have not been successful in improving his hemoglobin levels, and he has developed thrombocytopenia. He is also hypotensive and has a large bilobed exophytic mass in the left lobe of his liver, which may be causing a slow bleed. Other findings include extensive ascites, bilateral pleural effusion, generalized anasarca, and liver dysfunction.

Assessment and Plan:

1. The hepatic mass is likely related to recent cholangitis and instrumentation rather than a neoplastic process. Differential diagnosis includes abscess, hematoma with loculations, biloma, or a complex combination of the former. If the patient or interventional radiology (IR) feel a biopsy is not an option, more conservative measures such as repeat CT scan in one week to evaluate if the collection is less attenuated and more liquefied will be considered.
2. Bacteremia is most likely from the GI tract due to ERCP manipulation. Other potential sources include the hemodialysis catheter. VRE is sensitive"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admit with cholangitis and now with course complicated by
   A-fib and evolution of VRE bactermia in the setting of ESRD.
   1)Sepsis--VRE bacteremia at this time.  Reassuring negative blood
   cultures at this time and stable blood pressure off pressors.
   -IVF bolus as needed
   -F/U cultures
   -Continue antibiotics
   -Follow exam closely for suggestion of  compromise of
hardware
 with
   hip replacement
   2)Hepatic Mass--This is unclear in source.  There is outside hosptial
   CT scan describing absence of significant liver lesions which was a
   recent scan making infectious collection, biloma, acute bleed possible
   but is not typical by CT images.  Is likely accounting for slow venous
   bleeding but again source is not clear.
   -IR consulted and they are aware for possible intervention should acute
   bleeding be seen.
   -Will consult hepatology to consider possible source and further
   evaluation
   -Will need deicision on biopsy vs. repeat imaging.
   3)End Stage Renal Disease-
   -Will minimize fluids as possible
   -Plan for dialysis tomorrow

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and now complicated by atrial fibrillation and VRE bacteremia in the setting of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient has a large hepatic mass with surrounding blood but no evidence of acute bleeding. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.7째C, heart rate ranging from 73-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/39-87/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1583 mL and output of 0 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and morphine sulfate. Blood cultures are negative at this time, and the patient's blood pressure is off pressors. Imaging shows a large mass-like lesion in the left lobe of the liver with evidence of surrounding blood but no evidence of acute bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis - The patient has VRE bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Hepatic Mass - The presence of a large hepatic mass with surrounding blood raises concerns for potential bleeding complications.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease - The patient's ESRD requires careful management of fluids and planning for dialysis.
4. Atrial Fibrillation -"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of cholangitis, atrial fibrillation, and VRE bacteremia. She is currently in the ICU and is hemodynamically stable. The source of VRE bacteremia is presumed to be biliary, but there is a possibility of secondary seeding. The patient has difficult venous access, which complicates line management. The plan is to check a fistulogram, change the CVL with a negative tip, and discuss with renal about discontinuing dialysis catheter if the patient tolerates hemodialysis. If no further positive cultures today, ask IR for help transitioning to a PICC line. The patient also has a hepatic mass of unclear etiology, and outside hospital CT scans will be obtained to compare with previous scans. A biopsy or drainage will be held pending comparison of old scans. The patient has ESRD with access issues and is receiving HD per renal. She also has atrial fibrillation, which is currently stable. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and appropriate prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition will be to the floor if she tolerates the fistulogram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/VRE Bacteremia: The patient's current condition of sepsis and VRE bacteremia poses a high risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admit with cholangitis and now with course complicated by
   A-fib and evolution of VRE bactermia in the setting of ESRD.
   1)Sepsis--VRE bacteremia at this time. Reassuring negative blood
   cultures at this time and stable blood pressure off pressors.
   -IVF bolus as needed
   -F/U cultures
   -Continue antibiotics
   -Follow exam closely for suggestion of compromise of
hardware
 with
   hip replacement
   2)Hepatic Mass--This is unclear in source. There is outside hosptial CT
   scan describing absence of significant liver lesions which was a recent
   scan making infectious collection, biloma, acute bleed possible but is
   not typical by CT images. Is likely accounting for slow venous bleeding
   but again source is not clear.
   -IR consulted and they are aware for possible intervention should acute
   bleeding be seen.
   -Will consult hepatology to consider possible source and further
   evaluation
   -Will need deicision on biopsy vs. repeat imaging.
   3)End Stage Renal Disease-
   -Will minimize fluids as possible
   -Plan for dialysis tomorrow
   4)Atrial Fibrillation-

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with a PMH amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, and CAD who presented to an OSH
   with cholangitis s/p biliary stenting and ERCP x3, c/b bleeding and VRE
   bacteremia.  Now with a new liver mass over the course of one month.
   #Liver mass.  Impressive exophytic mass present in left lobe of liver
   with evidence of slow bleeding.  Given that this mass was not noted on
   OSH CT abd report from [**2185-3-31**], more likely this is related to her
   recent cholangitis and instrumentation rather than a neoplastic
   process.  Ddx includes abscess, hematoma with loculations, biloma or a
   complex combination of the former.  Presence of hemorrhagic mass
   partially explains pt
s persistently falling Hct and transfusion
   requirement.
   -Will obtain OSH records from [**Location (un) 2314**] so that our radiologists can
   better characterize the liver
   -Will consider a liver biopsy if stable for a tissue diagnosis,
   however, we are hesitant to do this as we are not sure what the nature
   of the mass is.  Can consider MRI for further characterization vs.
   imaging later with another CT to assess stability
   -IR willing to embolize the mass if she becomes hemodynamically
   unstable
   -Continue abx, appreciate ID recs
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.   TTE showing no vegetations, blood cultures with
   NGTD from [**4-21**].  HD line has not been changes.
   - Continue daptomycin for a prolonged course, may need a very long
   course given TAH, at the very least will need endocarditis protocol.
   - Continue to monitor surveillance cultures
   - Follow up ID recs
   -discussed with renal need to change HD line when pt goes down for
   fistulogram on  [**Month/Year (2) 570**], they see no complelling need as pt has cleared
   bacteremia and as line unlikely to be source, will re-adress based on
   fisulogram.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt has required total of 8 units of PRBCs, 1
   unit platelets since transfer to ICU on [**4-17**] with transfusion
   requirement decreasing.  Her HCT is stable today.  Possible sources of
   ongoing bleed include hepatic mass seen on CT and from ERCP site.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - continue PPI
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   - closely monitor plt/hct
   - call IR if pt becomes unstable as above, if pt bleeds at this point
   it is likely from mass.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - Responded well to amio, has been in sinus. Continue amiodarone for
   now.
   - Monitor LFTs- trending down.
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.  Has stayed in sinus during day today.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative x 3.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd
   on [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
   [**4-20**].  Most likely due to sepsis/critical illness and liver mass with
   possible splenic sequestration,  though may also be due to pantoprazole
   which can rarely cause this (<1%).
   -   transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # Hypotension.  Patient
s BP has been stable and low-normal
   - Continue abx as above
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD
   - Map goal >55
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE likely from GI source, broaded coverage
   per ID recs as above
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
 HD planned for [**Last Name (LF) 570**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need CVVH if BP low.
   -f/u renal recs, rec minimizing fluid, are concerned with degree of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the hospital with cholangitis following biliary stenting and ERCP procedures, and subsequently developed bacteremia and a new liver mass over the course of one month.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Liver mass: An impressive exophytic mass is present in the left lobe of the liver, with evidence of slow bleeding. It is likely related to recent cholangitis and instrumentation rather than a neoplastic process. Differential diagnoses include abscess, hematoma with loculations, biloma, or a complex combination of the former. The presence of a hemorrhagic mass partially explains the patient's persistently falling hemoglobin (Hct) and transfusion requirement.

2. Bacteremia: The most likely source is the GI tract from ERCP manipulation. Other potential sources are the HD catheter, especially since it was accessed emergently for IVF and pressors. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no vegetations, and blood cultures with next-generation DNA (NGTD) from 4/21 have been obtained. The HD line has not been changed.

3. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has required a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC"

   75F with a PMH amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, and CAD who presented to an OSH
   with cholangitis s/p biliary stenting and ERCP x3, c/b bleeding and VRE
   bacteremia.  Now with a new liver mass over the course of one month.
   #Liver mass.  Impressive exophytic mass present in left lobe of liver
   with evidence of slow bleeding.  Given that this mass was not noted on
   OSH CT abd report from [**2185-3-31**], more likely this is related to her
   recent cholangitis and instrumentation rather than a neoplastic
   process.  Ddx includes abscess, hematoma with loculations, biloma or a
   complex combination of the former.  Presence of hemorrhagic mass
   partially explains pt
s persistently falling Hct and transfusion
   requirement.
   -Will obtain OSH records from [**Location (un) 2314**] so that our radiologists can
   better characterize the liver
   -Will consider a liver biopsy if stable for a tissue diagnosis,
   however, we are hesitant to do this as we are not sure what the nature
   of the mass is.  Can consider MRI for further characterization vs.
   imaging later with another CT to assess stability
   -IR willing to embolize the mass if she becomes hemodynamically
   unstable
   -Continue abx, appreciate ID recs
   # Bacteremia. Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP manipulation.
   Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed emergently for
   IVF and pressors.   TTE showing no vegetations, blood cultures with
   NGTD from [**4-21**].  HD line has not been changes.
   - Continue daptomycin for a prolonged course, may need a very long
   course given TAH, at the very least will need endocarditis protocol.
   - Continue to monitor surveillance cultures
   - Follow up ID recs
   -discussed with renal need to change HD line when pt goes down for
   fistulogram on  [**Month/Year (2) 570**], they see no complelling need as pt has cleared
   bacteremia and as line unlikely to be source, will re-adress based on
   fisulogram.
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Pt has required total of 8 units of PRBCs, 1
   unit platelets since transfer to ICU on [**4-17**] with transfusion
   requirement decreasing.  Her HCT is stable today.  Possible sources of
   ongoing bleed include hepatic mass seen on CT and from ERCP site.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - continue PPI
   - Hold all antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants
   - Epo with HD
   - closely monitor plt/hct
   - call IR if pt becomes unstable as above, if pt bleeds at this point
   it is likely from mass.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - Responded well to amio, has been in sinus. Continue amiodarone for
   now.
   - Monitor LFTs- trending down.
   - As infection improves, afib may resolve, will plan to dc amio in a
   few days after she has been on appropriate antibiotics for her
   bacteremia.  Has stayed in sinus during day today.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia: Concern for DIC initially in setting of
   cholangitis, but has persisted after treatment.  Repeat DIC labs
   negative x 3.  HIT antibody negative. Possibly related to zosyn (d/c'd
   on [**4-13**]) and levoflox which can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, dc
   [**4-20**].  Most likely due to sepsis/critical illness and liver mass with
   possible splenic sequestration,  though may also be due to pantoprazole
   which can rarely cause this (<1%).
   -   transfuse >50 if actively bleeding
   # Hypotension.  Patient
s BP has been stable and low-normal
   - Continue abx as above
   - Caution with fluid removal with HD
   - Map goal >55
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE likely from GI source, broaded coverage
   per ID recs as above
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent: ECG with ischemic changes in
   setting of hypotension due to GI bleeding. Likely demand event due to
   acute blood loss rather than unstable plaque.
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
 HD planned for [**Last Name (LF) 570**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need CVVH if BP low.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented to the hospital with cholangitis after undergoing biliary stenting and ERCP procedures. She developed bleeding and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. A new liver mass was detected over the course of one month.

The patient underwent a fistulogram that showed three areas of focal narrowing but with adequate result, indicating that the fistula can be used. The interventional radiology (IR) team considered elective embolization of the liver mass due to suspicion of bleeding. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring revealed a blood pressure of 99/42 mmHg and a heart rate of 84 bpm. The patient's weight is 71 kg, and height is 64 inches. Fluid balance shows an input of 300 mL and output of 225 mL.

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, platelet count of 48 K/uL, sodium level of 96 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 109 mg/dL, total bilirubin level of 4.1 mg/dL,"

   75F with a PMH amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, and CAD who presented to an OSH
   with cholangitis s/p biliary stenting and ERCP x3, c/b bleeding and VRE
   bacteremia.  Now with a new liver mass.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had fistulogram that showed 3 areas of focal narrowing that were
   dilated suboptimally, but with adequate result, fistula okay to use.
   - IR will consider elective embolization of liver mass given suspicion
   for bleeding in the setting of a new HCT drop.
   - Plan for HD in the AM, unable to complete HD yesterday as the patient
   was at IR all day.
   - ID Recs: 2 week course of linezolid/dapto (until [**2185-5-4**]) if the liver
   mass is not an abscess and no e/o hip involvement, hip films ordered to
   confirm this.  Will need surveillance cultures x2 days after abx
   -Can likely pull dialysis catheter tomorrow AM as fistula okay to use.

   75F with a PMH amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, and CAD who presented to an OSH
   with cholangitis s/p biliary stenting and ERCP x3, c/b bleeding and VRE
   bacteremia.  Now with a new liver mass.
   #Liver mass.  Impressive exophytic mass present in left lobe of liver
   with evidence of slow bleeding.  Given that this mass was not noted on
   OSH CT abd report from [**2185-3-31**], more likely this is related to her
   recent cholangitis and instrumentation rather than a neoplastic
   process.  Ddx includes abscess, hematoma with loculations, biloma or a
   complex combination of the former.  Presence of hemorrhagic mass
   partially explains pt
s persistently falling Hct and transfusion
   requirement.   Now with HCT drom to 24.5 from 27-28 range.
   -Will consider IR embolization given new HCT drop
   -Will obtain OSH records from [**Location (un) 2314**] so that our radiologists can
   better characterize the liver
   -Will consider a liver biopsy if stable for a tissue diagnosis,
   however, we are hesitant to do this as we are not sure what the nature
   of the mass is.  Can consider MRI for further characterization vs.
   imaging later with another CT to assess stability-

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the hospital with cholangitis after undergoing biliary stenting and three ERCP procedures. The patient has developed bleeding and VRE bacteremia. A new liver mass was found, and she has experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT). The patient requires ongoing blood transfusions and has required a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of platelets since admission. She also has atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, cholangitis, and a history of recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has ongoing bleeding, possibly from the hepatic mass seen on CT and from the ERCP site. There is a concern for acute blood loss anemia, and the patient's HCT has dropped. The sources of bleeding need to be identified and controlled.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has VRE bacteremia, likely from the GI tract due to ERCP manipulation. She is being treated with daptomycin and linezolid for a two-week course until [**2185-5-4**] if the liver mass is not an abscess and there is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the 24-hour events include a fistulogram that showed focal narrowing in the fistula, which was adequately dilated. The patient also had an elective embolization of a liver mass due to suspicion of bleeding. The plan for hemodialysis (HD) was delayed as the patient was in the interventional radiology (IR) suite most of the afternoon. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, daptomycin, was given on [**2185-4-24**] at 08:27 PM.

The vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.3째C (97.3째F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm (with a range of 84-102 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 99/42 mmHg (with a range of 92/38-118/54 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 9-19 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

The patient's weight is currently 71 kg, with an admission weight of 65 kg. The height is 64 inches. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 300 mL and output of 225 mL over 24 hours.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of VRE bacteremia. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone several interventions. Notable events include a fistulogram showing focal narrowing, successful balloon dilation of an AVF, a decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) from 28% to 24%, and the presence of small amounts of black stool. The patient is currently receiving a two-week course of daptomycin and linezolid. Allergies are not reported. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/52 mmHg to 120/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has increased from 65 kg to 71 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 300-465 mL and output of 0 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen, and their ABG results are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals icteric sclerae, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, thromboc"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-inch tall male with a current weight of 71 kg, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of VRE bacteremia. The patient underwent a fistulogram, which showed three areas of focal narrowing in the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The AVF was successfully dilated, and it is now okay for use. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 28% to 24%, and there was only one small amount of black stool. The patient received a two-week course of daptomycin and linezolid, depending on the liver mass being an abscess or not, and whether the hip is involved. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.3째C (97.3째F)
- Heart rate: 100 bpm (84-102)
- Blood pressure: 111/52 mmHg (67-80)
- Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (11-25)
- Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 300 mL and output of 465 mL since 12 AM. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, linezolid, calcium acetate, risperdal, and amiodarone.

Physical examination findings include icteric sclerae, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, absence of peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and 2+ edema in the upper extremities. The patient also has jaundice and is not assessed neurologically.

Laboratory results show the following:
- Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 13.6 K/uL
- Platelet count: 48 K/uL
- Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
- Glucose: 109 mg/dL
- Other lab values are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal.

The patient has a history of bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is currently negative since April 21. The assessment and plan include further characterization of the liver mass, monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin concentration, management of atrial fibrillation, investigation of thrombocytopenia, and continuous hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and amyloidosis on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with cholangitis after multiple ERCPs. She experienced bleeding at the sphincterotomy site, resulting in blood loss anemia, hypovolemic shock, and demand ischemia. The patient also had VRE bacteremia, new atrial fibrillation (afib), thrombocytopenia, and a finding of a large liver mass. The liver mass is unclear whether it is an abscess, necrosis, blood, or biloma. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been dropping, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) or bleeding into the liver mass. The patient is currently receiving daptomycin and linezolid for the VRE bacteremia and undergoing hemodialysis for ESRD. She also has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with amiodarone, and thrombocytopenia, which is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's Hct levels have been dropping, suggesting ongoing bleeding. It is important to identify the source of bleeding and control it to prevent further blood loss and anemia.
2. VRE bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed VRE bacteremia, which can lead to severe infections. The appropriate antibiotics, d"

   Assessment and Plan
   75-year-old woman with cholangitis (s/p multiple ERCPs c/b bleeding),
   AFib, VRE bacteremia, and difficult venous access on a background of
   ESRD due to amyloidosis.  Many of her acute issues have improved, but
   we are evaluating a marked CT abnormality of her liver.
   Hepatic mass
   Unclear etiology.  We will try to get outside hospital CT scans; report
   suggests finding was not there previously.
   Consult hepatology for guidance regarding drainage, sampling, further
   eval (e.g. MRI), etc.
   Sepsis / VRE bacteremia
          Hemodynamically stable
          Appreciate ID and renal
s help.
          Source of VRE is presumptively biliary.  However, there is
   always the possibility of secondary seeding.
   o         TTE unremarkable
   o         Check hip films. Low threshold to investigate hip further if
   either local changes or recurrent bacteremia.
   o         Line management is complicated given very difficult access
   issues.
          Try fistula when OK with renal; If OK and tolerates, discuss
   with renal about d/c dialysis catheter (in place throughout episode).
          CVL was changed (by wire) with negative tip.
          consider PICC if cx remain negative
   ESRD
   Access issues as above.  HD per renal.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to amyloidosis, on hemodialysis, and with a recent diagnosis of cholangitis. She has been experiencing several complications, including bleeding at the sphincterotomy site, hypovolemic shock, demand ischemia, VRE bacteremia, new-onset atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, and the presence of a large liver mass.

24-hour events include a successful balloon dilation of three areas of focal narrowing in the fistulogram, with the arteriovenous fistula now reportedly ready for use. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 28 to 24 due to a small amount of black stool. Hemodialysis was performed today.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and her last dose of antibiotics was daptomycin at 08:27 PM on [**2185-4-24**]. She is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the additional finding of a large liver mass. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.3째C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/52 to 120/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

   Blood cultures from [**Date range (1) 2464**] with NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   75F with a PMH amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, and CAD who presented to an OSH
   with cholangitis s/p biliary stenting and ERCP x3, c/b bleeding and VRE
   bacteremia.  Now with a new liver mass.
   # GI bleeding: Has had melanotic stool persistently over the last 24
   hours.  Likely related to low platelets.  HCT dropped from 28 to 24
   yesterday with this.  She is s/p blood transfusion and HCT has
   responded appropriately
   -Q8H HCT monitoring
   -Will transfuse one unit of platelets
   -Will d/c linezolid per ID recs: likely contributing to
   thrombocytopenia
   -Holding anticoagulants
   #Liver mass.  Impressive exophytic mass present in left lobe of liver
   with evidence of slow bleeding.  Given that this mass was not noted on
   OSH CT abd report from [**2185-3-31**], more likely this is related to her
   recent cholangitis and instrumentation rather than a neoplastic
   process.
   -Radiology and GI to review OSH records, in the chart
   -Will consider a liver biopsy if the lesion seems stable for this
   procedure
    -Continue abx, appreciate ID recs
   # Bacteremia. VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP
   manipulation.  Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed
   emergently for IVF and pressors.   TTE showing no vegetations,
   surveillance blood cultures with NGTD from [**4-21**].  HD line has not been
   changed.  Hip films are not optimal for evaluation of TAH
   - Continue daptomycin per ID recs
   - Continue to monitor surveillance cultures until two days post
   completion of abx
   - Follow up ID recs
   -Will pull dialysis catheter  if she tolerates ultrafiltration via AV
   fistula
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - Responded well to amio, has been in sinus. Continue amiodarone for
   now, consider d/cing amio as infection improves
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia:  DIC labs negative, HIT ab negative.  Possibly due
   to a medication effect (patient has been on zosyn, levofloxacin,
   linezolid and pantoprazole- all of which rarely cause thrombocytopenia)
   vs. splenic sequestration in the setting of a liver mass.
   -will transfuse today in the setting of platelets <50 and melena
   -discontinuing linezolid
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].  Now complicated by VRE bacteremia
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE per ID recs
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent:
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
   -ultrafiltration today.
   -EKG if K >6
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD
   -renally dose meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department with cholangitis following biliary stenting and ERCP procedures. The patient is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, VRE bacteremia, a new liver mass, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and cholangitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing persistent melena, indicating ongoing bleeding. This could be due to low platelet count or the liver mass. Monitoring HCT levels and transfusing platelets as needed is recommended.
2. VRE bacteremia: The patient has VRE bacteremia, which is likely from the recent ERCP manipulation or the HD catheter. Daptomycin should be continued, and surveillance blood cultures should be monitored until two days post completion of antibiotics.
3. Liver mass: The patient has an impressive exophytic mass in the left lobe of the liver with evidence of slow bleeding. Further evaluation with a liver biopsy may be considered if the lesion seems stable for the procedure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to medication effects or splenic sequestration in the setting of the liver mass. Transfusion of platelets should be done"

   hours.  Likely related to low platelets.  HCT dropped from 28 to 24
   yesterday with this.  She is s/p blood transfusion and HCT has
   responded appropriately
   -Q8H HCT monitoring
   -Will transfuse one unit of platelets
   -Will d/c linezolid per ID recs: likely contributing to
   thrombocytopenia
   -Holding anticoagulants
   #Liver mass.  Impressive exophytic mass present in left lobe of liver
   with evidence of slow bleeding.  Given that this mass was not noted on
   OSH CT abd report from [**2185-3-31**], more likely this is related to her
   recent cholangitis and instrumentation rather than a neoplastic
   process.
   -Radiology and GI to review OSH records, in the chart
   -Will consider a liver biopsy if the lesion seems stable for this
   procedure
    -Continue abx, appreciate ID recs
   # Bacteremia. VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP
   manipulation.  Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed
   emergently for IVF and pressors.   TTE showing no vegetations,
   surveillance blood cultures with NGTD from [**4-21**].  HD line has not been
   changed.  Hip films are not optimal for evaluation of TAH
   - Continue daptomycin per ID recs
   - Continue to monitor surveillance cultures until two days post
   completion of abx
   - Follow up ID recs
   -Will pull dialysis catheter  if she tolerates ultrafiltration via AV
   fistula
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - Responded well to amio, has been in sinus. Continue amiodarone for
   now, consider d/cing amio as infection improves
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Thrombocytopenia:  DIC labs negative, HIT ab negative.  Possibly due
   to a medication effect (patient has been on zosyn, levofloxacin,
   linezolid and pantoprazole- all of which rarely cause thrombocytopenia)
   vs. splenic sequestration in the setting of a liver mass.
   -will transfuse today in the setting of platelets <50 and melena
   -discontinuing linezolid
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].  Now complicated by VRE bacteremia
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE per ID recs
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent:
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
   -ultrafiltration today.
   -EKG if K >6
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD
   -renally dose meds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented to the emergency room with cholangitis following biliary stenting and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and she is now experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, a new liver mass, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and cholangitis.

Summary of Information:
- The patient has had four episodes of melena overnight, resulting in a decrease in hematocrit from 28 to 24. One unit of packed red blood cells was transfused.
- Renal services recommend removing the patient's hemodialysis line under interventional radiology guidance if she tolerates ultrafiltration through her arteriovenous fistula.
- The patient's MRI is on hold as it will be minimally beneficial, and she is unable to tolerate lying flat for the study.
- The patient has allergies to no known medications.
- The patient received daptomycin and linezolid on [04/26/2185], but these were discontinued per ID recommendations.
- The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix), amiodarone, nephrocaps, calcium acetate, risperidone, and morphine as needed for pain.
- The patient's respiratory system shows improvement in shortness of breath, and there is no abdominal pain reported.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.2째C (97.1째F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/37 mmHg to 122/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's weight is currently 76 kg, with a height of 64 inches.
- The patient has a central venous pressure of 6 mmHg, and fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,085 mL.
- The patient is not on respiratory support, and her ABG results are not provided.
- Physical examination reveals jaundice, edematous skin with transudative fluid leakage, scleral icterus, normal dentition, and bilateral 3+ pitting edema.
- Neurologic examination is not assessed due to patient's unresponsiveness.
- Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 10.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, glucose of 102 mg/dL, creatinine of 3.6 mg/dL, potassium of 28 mEq/L, sodium of 136 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, calcium of 8.5 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL, and phosphate of 3.8 mg/dL.
- Other lab results are also provided, including elevated D-dimer levels and low albumin levels.
- The patient's blood cultures from [04/23/2185] to [04/27/2185] are positive for VRE.
- Assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring and treatment for gastrointestinal bleeding, liver mass, VRE bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and cholangitis.
- The patient's lines, medications, and ICU care are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing persistent melena, likely due to low platelets. Continuous monitoring of hematocrit levels is essential to guide further transfusion requirements.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may contribute to ongoing bleeding. Discontinuation of linezolid and transfusion of platelets are recommended.
3. VRE bacteremia: The patient is infected with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Appropriate antibiotic therapy, such as daptomycin, should be continued.
4. Liver mass: An impressive exophytic mass in the left lobe"

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of liver mass, GI bleed, and VRE bacteremia. She has experienced multiple episodes of melena (black, tarry stools) overnight, resulting in a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 28% to 24%. The patient received a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The renal team recommends removing her hemodialysis (HD) line under interventional radiology (IR) guidance if she tolerates ultrafiltration by her arteriovenous (AV) fistula. The patient's allergies are listed as no known drug allergies. She is currently receiving various medications including daptomycin, linezolid, pantoprazole, amiodarone, morphine, nephrocaps, calcium acetate, and risperidone. The patient's initial pain score was 9 on a 0-10 scale, but it has improved to 5. Her respiratory distress has also improved. The patient has a history of abdominal pain, but it is not currently present. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.2째C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 83/34-91/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. She has a history of cholangitis, atrial fibrillation, VRE bacteremia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to amyloidosis. The patient presented with melena, which is the passage of black, tarry stools. This can be indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been dropping, suggesting ongoing blood loss.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly low blood pressure and an elevated heart rate. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is good. The patient is currently not on respiratory support.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 915 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with 865 mL given orally and 50 mL through intravenous fluids. The patient has also received 375 mL of blood products. Her total output was 2,000 mL, with no urine output recorded.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated, but not significantly. Her platelet count is low, which could be contributing to the bleeding. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal blood clotting parameters.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is cachectic, with mild tenderness in the epigastric"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cholangitis who underwent three ERCP procedures. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with VRE bacteremia, GI bleed, and a new liver mass. The patient has experienced melanotic stool overnight, and her HCT was stable at 28 without requiring transfusion. Renal is recommending pulling her HD line out by IR guidance on [**4-28**] if she tolerates ultrafiltration by her AV fistula. Initial imaging suggests malignancy that may not have changed much from prior images. DIC labs were unremarkable, and schistocytes were not seen on smear.

   75F with a PMH amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, and CAD who presented to an OSH
   with cholangitis s/p biliary stenting and ERCP x3, c/b bleeding and VRE
   bacteremia.  Now with a new liver mass and GI bleed.
   # GI bleeding: Has had melanotic stool persistently over the last 48
   hours, overall decreasing in frequency.  Likely related to low
   platelets.  HCT dropped from 28 to 24 on [**4-27**] with this.  She is s/p
   blood and platelet transfusion on [**4-27**] and HCT is stable at 28,
   although her platelets are no responding.
   -Q12H HCT monitoring, transfusion goal >28
   -Holding anticoagulants
   -[**Month (only) 60**] need endoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate
   #Liver mass.  Impressive exophytic mass present in left lobe of liver
   with evidence of slow bleeding.  It appears that this mass was also on
   [**3-31**] imaging from OSH, which increases our suspicion for malignancy.
   -Radiology and GI to review OSH records in detail
   -Will consider a liver biopsy if the lesion seems stable for this
   procedure
   -Appreciate GI recs
   # Bacteremia. VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP
   manipulation.  Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed
   emergently for IVF and pressors.   TTE showing no vegetations,
   surveillance blood cultures negative on [**4-21**] and NGTD [**Date range (1) 2485**].  HD
   line has not been changed.  Hip films are not optimal for evaluation of
   TAH
   - Continue daptomycin per ID recs
   - Follow up ID recs
   -Will pull dialysis catheter  if she tolerates ultrafiltration via AV
   fistula
   # Thrombocytopenia:  DIC labs negative, HIT ab negative.   She has ESRD
   and was septic, therefore her platelets are dysfunctional, and she may
   not respond in a predictable way to transfusion as her platelet count
   is not a complete reflection of her hemostatic capability.   Her melena
   has decreased in frequency which is reassuring.
   -Will transfuse for active bleeding,
   -consider DDAVP
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - Responded well to amio, has been in sinus. Continue amiodarone for
   now, consider d/cing amio as infection improves
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].  Now complicated by VRE bacteremia
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE per ID recs
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent:
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
   -ultrafiltration today.
   -EKG if K >6
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD
   -renally dose meds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency room with cholangitis following a biliary stenting and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. She developed bleeding and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient also has a new liver mass and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, characterized by melanotic stool. Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped from 28 to 24 on 04/27 but stabilized at 28 after blood and platelet transfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleeding: The patient has persistent GI bleeding, likely related to low platelets. She has received blood and platelet transfusions, but her platelets are not responding. Monitoring of HCT is important, and transfusion goal should be maintained above 28. Holding anticoagulants is recommended, and an endoscopy and colonoscopy are needed to evaluate the liver mass.

2. Liver Mass: The patient has an impressive exophytic mass in the left lobe of the liver with evidence of slow bleeding. This mass was also present on previous imaging from the outside hospital. It increases suspicion for malignancy. Radiology and gastroenterology (GI) teams should review the"

   TAH
   - Continue daptomycin per ID recs
   - Follow up ID recs
   -Will pull dialysis catheter  if she tolerates ultrafiltration via AV
   fistula
   # Thrombocytopenia:  DIC labs negative, HIT ab negative.   She has ESRD
   and was septic, therefore her platelets are dysfunctional, and she may
   not respond in a predictable way to transfusion as her platelet count
   is not a complete reflection of her hemostatic capability.   Her melena
   has decreased in frequency which is reassuring.
   -Will transfuse for active bleeding,
   -consider DDAVP
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - Responded well to amio, has been in sinus. Continue amiodarone for
   now, consider d/cing amio as infection improves
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].  Now complicated by VRE bacteremia
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE per ID recs
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI and ?stent:
   - Hold ASA and plavix given bleeding
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   - No anticoagulants given bleeding
   - Treat anemia per above, hct >28
   - Repeat ECG shows resolution of changes
   # ESRD on HD
   -ultrafiltration today.
   -EKG if K >6
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD
   -renally dose meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the hospital with cholangitis following biliary stenting and ERCP, which was complicated by bleeding and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient has now developed a new liver mass and is experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

24-hour events:
- The patient had melanotic stool overnight, indicating GI bleeding. Her hematocrit (HCT) dropped from 28 to 24 on [**4-27**], but stabilized at 28 after blood and platelet transfusion.
- The renal team recommends removing her HD line via interventional radiology guidance on [**4-28**], if she tolerates ultrafiltration through her arteriovenous (AV) fistula.
- Initial preliminary imaging suggests malignancy that may not change much from prior imaging.
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs were unremarkable, and the smear did not show schistocytes.
- The patient received an extra dose of daptomycin since she had received the dose prior to HD.
- She continues to be refractory to platelets.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

Potential medical complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has had melanotic stool persistently over the last 48 hours, likely related to low platelets. Her HCT dropped from 28 to 24 on [**4-27**], but stabilized at 28 after blood and platelet transfusion. She is still unresponsive to platelet transfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of cholangitis, atrial fibrillation, VRE bacteremia, and end-stage renal disease due to amyloidosis. She is currently in the ICU and has had multiple episodes of melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Her thrombocytopenia is being evaluated for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but both tests came back negative. The patient also has a hepatic mass of unclear etiology, and further evaluation is needed. She has sepsis and VRE bacteremia, with the source presumptively being biliary. There are issues with line management due to difficult venous access. The patient has chronic kidney disease and is on dialysis, with access problems. She also has a history of coronary artery disease and is a candidate for stent placement. Her atrial fibrillation is stable on amiodarone. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI), and she is being considered for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding
2. Development of DIC or other coagulopathy
3. Infection or sepsis due to VRE bacteremia
4. Complications related to the hepatic mass, such as bleeding or liver failure

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including cholangitis, atrial fibrillation, VRE bacteremia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to amyloidosis. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient has experienced two episodes of melena today, which indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. Her hemodynamic status is stable, and her hematocrit levels have not significantly changed. A hepatology consultation has been requested to evaluate the role of endoscopy in managing her hepatic mass.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is being evaluated, and DIC and HIT labs are negative. There is a question of platelet consumption due to the GI bleed yesterday and possible splenic sequestration in the setting of the liver mass. However, the patient's platelet count has been stable since yesterday.

The patient's sepsis and VRE bacteremia are presumed to be related to a biliary source. However, secondary seeding cannot be ruled out. The source control for the infection is complicated by difficult venous access issues.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, for which she underwent stenting on [**2185-3-15**]. The type of stent used is unclear, and the possibility of restarting Plavix needs to be considered.

Regarding the patient's ESRD, access issues have caused complications in managing her dialysis catheter. A change"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with a PMH amyloidosis, ESRD on HD, and CAD who presented to an OSH
   with cholangitis s/p biliary stenting and ERCP x3, c/b bleeding and VRE
   bacteremia.  Now with a new liver mass and GI bleed.
   # GI bleeding: Has had melanotic stool persistently over the last 48
   hours, overall decreasing in frequency.  Likely related to low
   platelets.  HCT dropped from 28 to 24 on [**4-27**] with this.  She is s/p
   blood and platelet transfusion on [**4-27**] and HCT is stable at 28.
   -Q12H HCT monitoring, transfusion goal >[**5-25**] need endoscopy and colonoscopy to evaluate
   #Liver mass.  Impressive exophytic mass present in left lobe of liver
   with evidence of slow bleeding.  It appears that this mass was also on
   [**3-31**] imaging from OSH, which increases our suspicion for malignancy.
   -Hepatology to perform liver biopsy when GI bleed is stopped
   -Appreciate GI recs
   # Bacteremia. VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is GI tract from ERCP
   manipulation.  Other potential sources are HD catheter, esp as accessed
   emergently for IVF and pressors.   TTE showing no vegetations,
   surveillance blood cultures negative on [**5-7**] and NGTD [**Date range (1) 2498**].
   HD line has not been changed.  Hip films are not optimal for evaluation
   of TAH
   - Continue daptomycin per ID recs
   - Follow up ID recs
   -Will pull dialysis catheter today
   # Thrombocytopenia:  DIC labs negative, HIT ab negative.   She has ESRD
   and was septic, therefore her platelets are dysfunctional, and she may
   not respond in a predictable way to transfusion as her platelet count
   is not a complete reflection of her hemostatic capability.   Her melena
   has decreased in frequency which is reassuring.
   -Will transfuse for active bleeding,
   -consider DDAVP if it becomes recalcitrant
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient in paroxysmal afib.  Potential causes
   include high grade bacteremia, hypotension, ischemia though this is
   less likely.  Patient cannot be anticoagulated due to ongoing bleed.
   - Responded well to amio, has been in sinus. Continue amiodarone for
   now, consider d/cing amio as infection improves
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Cholangitis, biliary obstruction: s/p ERCP x3 with placement of CBD
   stent x2. Stones removed on prior study. Completed 7 day course zosyn
   on [**4-13**].  Now complicated by VRE bacteremia
   - Daptomycin as above as VRE per ID recs
   - Repeat ERCP with stent removal in 2 months
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p recent NSTEMI in [**9-/2184**], and has presumably completed 3
   months of ASA/plavix:
   -restarted ASA/ plavix as her bleed has improved
   - Hold beta-blocker given hypotension
   - Hold statin given LFT abnormalities
   # ESRD on HD
   -continue HD per protocol
   -continue nephrocaps, calcium acetate, getting epo and zemplar with HD
   -renally dose meds
   -appreciate renal recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of amyloidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the emergency department with cholangitis following biliary stenting and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) x3, which resulted in bleeding and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient is currently experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and has a new liver mass.

24-Hour Events:
- The decision was made to perform a liver biopsy when the patient is more stable, as the GI bleeding has not yet stopped.
- The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is stable at 28 after receiving a blood and platelet transfusion.
- Additional tests, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), have been ordered.
- An internal jugular (IR) line will be pulled on Friday.
- The family was updated on the patient's plan, and the physician was called out.

   75-year-old woman with cholangitis (s/p multiple ERCPs c/b bleeding),
   AFib, VRE bacteremia, and difficult venous access on a background of
   ESRD due to amyloidosis.  Many of her acute issues have improved, but
   we are evaluating a marked CT abnormality of her liver.
   Thrombocytopenia: DIC and HIT labs negative, question of consumption
   with GI bleed yesterday and possible splenic sequestration in setting
   of liver mass), plts stable since yesterday
   Melena:  2 episodes today with stable HCT, [**Hospital1 **] HCT, Hepatology to see
   this AM re role of scope
   Hepatic mass: Unclear etiology.  Obtained OSH outside hospital CT
   scans; report suggests finding was there previously but need to be
   reviewed.Consulted hepatology for guidance regarding drainage,
   sampling, further eval (e.g. MRI), etc.
   Sepsis / VRE bacteremia: Source of VRE is presumptively biliary.
   However, there is always the possibility of secondary seeding.
   o         TTE unremarkable
   o         Line management is complicated given very difficult access
   issues but if  fistula functioning, discuss with renal about d/c
   dialysis catheter today
              CVL was changed (by wire) with negative tip.
          consider PICC if cx remain negative
   CAD: s/p stent on [**2185-3-15**] - clarify id bare mental versus drug eleuting

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of cholangitis, atrial fibrillation, VRE bacteremia, and end-stage renal disease due to amyloidosis. She is currently in the ICU for multiple reasons, including a gastrointestinal bleed, thrombocytopenia, and a hepatic mass of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/41 mmHg to 134/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic Mass: The presence of a hepatic mass raises concerns about the underlying cause and potential for further complications such as bleeding or metastasis. Further evaluation, such as an MRI, may be needed to determine the etiology and guide appropriate management.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has experienced episodes of melena, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to hypotension, anemia, and potentially require blood transfusions or endoscopic intervention.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of the ongoing GI bleed and the presence of a hepatic mass. Monitoring platelet counts and considering interventions like platelet transfusion may be necessary.
