   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo F with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia,
   left subfrontal and corpus callosum with some associated edema and mass
   effect s/p 3 cycles of methotrexate initially admitted for scheduled
   Methotrexate/Rituximab dosing transferred to the ICU with acute mental
   status decline.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Likely secondary to progression of
   intracranial mass/edema and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate
   and rituximab therapy. No signs of primary metabolic disorder. Unable
   to exclude infectious explanation - afebrile with normal WBC but
   currently on chemotherapy. MRI shows no signs of acute ischemic or
   hemorrhagic complication.
   - Continue pulse dose steroids and mannitol
 will d/w neuro- onc for
   goals of mannitol treatment and duration.
   - Discuss further external beam cranial irradiation and chemotherapy
   with radiation oncology and primary neuro-oncologist.
   - F/U blood, urine cultures: chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia.
   - Q4h neuro checks.
   - F/U EEG official read to rule out status epilepticus.
   - Continue seizure prophylaxis with Keppra.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] require intubation if persistent altered mental status, inability
   to protect airway. If this occurs can hyperventilate to decrease
   intracranial pressure.

   # CNS lymphoma. As above, appears to be unchanged on MR imaging.
   Currently s/p 4th cycle of methotrexate and rituximab.
   - Neuro-oncology and radiation-oncology following.
   - Continue leucovorin and bicarb according to protocol
 Neuro oncology
   recs continuous Bicarb infusion to keep urine pH<7.5.
   - Discuss further brain irradiation therapy with radiation oncology.
   Next treatment today.
   - Continue seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam.
   - Discuss goals of care further with patient's husband and primary
   neuro-oncologist.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum with associated edema and mass effect.
- She was admitted for scheduled Methotrexate/Rituximab dosing and later transferred to the ICU due to acute mental status decline.
- The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, likely secondary to progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy.
- No signs of primary metabolic disorder were observed, but an infectious explanation cannot be completely excluded given the patient's chemotherapy treatment.
- An MRI showed no signs of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic complications.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows:
  - Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
  - Heart rate: 91 bpm (within normal range)
  - Blood pressure: 174/101 mmHg (elevated, but considered okay for perfusion in the setting of increased intracranial pressure)
  - Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute (within normal range)
  - Oxygen saturation: 96% (within normal range)
- The patient has limited mobility on the right side with R facial droop, R foot drop, and weakness. PERRL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal, and corpus callosum with associated edema and mass effect. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled methotrexate/rituximab dosing and experienced an acute mental status decline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's elevated blood pressure and altered mental status suggest the possibility of increased ICP. It is important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.
2. Infection: Despite being on chemotherapy, the patient's normal white blood cell count makes it difficult to exclude an infectious cause for the altered mental status. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered to rule out any infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of PICC-associated right upper extremity DVT. Enoxaparin therapy should be continued to prevent clotting complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is unchanged from baseline. Monitoring and treating it is necessary to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed carefully, especially in the setting of increased ICP. Holding antihypertensive medications may be appropriate to allow for brain perfusion.
6. Hyperlipidemia: Although not currently on therapy, managing the patient's lipid levels may be important for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled methotrexate/rituximab dosing and experienced an acute mental status decline. She is currently somnolent and has altered mental status likely due to progression of intracranial mass/edema or complications from ongoing chemotherapy. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hypertension, hypercalcemia, and hyperlipidemia. She also has a PICC-associated right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's altered mental status and the presence of intracranial mass/edema increase the risk of increased ICP. This can lead to symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and neurological deficits.
2. Seizures: Due to the presence of intracranial mass and ongoing chemotherapy, the patient is at an increased risk of seizures. Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam is being continued.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a PICC-associated right upper extremity DVT. There is a risk of the clot extending or new clots forming in other locations, leading to potential pulmonary embolism.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum with associated edema and mass effect. She has been admitted to the ICU for scheduled Methotrexate/Rituximab dosing and experienced an acute mental status decline.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Altered mental status: This is likely secondary to the progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or complications from ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy. No signs of primary metabolic disorder are present, but an infectious explanation cannot be entirely excluded due to the patient's current chemotherapy treatment. An MRI shows no signs of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic complications.

The proposed management includes continuing pulse dose steroids and mannitol for 7 days per Neuro-oncology, external beam cranial irradiation per radiation oncology and primary neuro-oncologist, follow-up blood and urine cultures, chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia, and monitoring neuro checks every 4 hours. If there is an acute change, the patient's mannitol and dexamethasone dosage should be increased. An EEG without epileptiform waves is also mentioned.

2. CNS lymphoma: The lymphoma appears to be unchanged on MR imaging and the patient has completed the 4th cycle of methotrexate and rituximab. Neuro-oncology and radiation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal, and corpus callosum. She has been admitted to the ICU for scheduled methotrexate/rituximab dosing and is currently experiencing an acute mental status decline. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, anemia, hypertension, hypercalcemia, and chronic lymphoma. She is being treated with pulse dose steroids, mannitol, and seizure prophylaxis with Keppra. Further discussions are planned with neuro-oncology and radiation oncology regarding external beam cranial irradiation and chemotherapy. The patient also has a PICC-associated right upper extremity DVT, for which she is receiving enoxaparin therapy. Other ongoing treatments include prophylaxis for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema from the lymphoma and ongoing chemotherapy.
2. Infection due to immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Pulmonary embolism from the DVT in the upper extremity.
4. Renal dysfunction due to hypercalcemia and dehydration.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulcers.

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum with associated edema and mass effect. She has been admitted to the ICU for scheduled methotrexate/rituximab dosing. The patient is currently experiencing altered mental status, which is likely secondary to the progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The presence of intracranial mass and edema can lead to increased ICP, which can cause further decline in mental status and potentially lead to herniation if not managed appropriately.

2. Infection: The patient is currently on chemotherapy, which makes her more susceptible to infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and changes in white blood cell count, is important.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of PICC-associated right upper extremity DVT. Enoxaparin therapy should be continued to prevent further clot formation.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may require further evaluation and management.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient's chief complaint is altered mental status. The patient is currently undergoing radiation therapy for a left hemispheric CNS mass, which is likely causing the altered mental status. The patient's mental status is improving with treatment, including XRT (radiation therapy), Decadron (dexamethasone), and mannitol.

The patient has a history of lymphoma (cancer) in the CNS, for which they have received Methotrexate and XRT. The prognosis for this condition is poor.

The patient also has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity and has had an IVC filter placed. They are receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for treatment.

Additionally, the patient has chronic anemia, which is stable and being monitored. They also have benign hypertension, which is acceptable and being monitored.

The patient's labs show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. Their potassium and magnesium levels are low, and their calcium and phosphorus levels are within normal ranges.

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) pending radiation therapy and has poor nutritional status. They are receiving ICU care, including glycemic control and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   Medical history and hospital course reviewed in detail.  Patient has
   extensive CNS malignancy, which is non-curable, and highly resistent to
   all therapy (including chemotherapy) to date, now receiving palliative
   XRT in hopes of reducing size of CNS tumor.  In this context, with
   incurable progressive intracranial malignancy, and in the absence of
   significant medical co-morbidities, in the event of cardio-pulmonary
   arrest, likely reflects progression of intracranial process, without
   likelyhood of meaningful  clinical recovery, and medical resussitation
   would represent medical futility.  Thus, in the event of
   cardio-pulmonary arrest, will not perform CPR or intubation (i.e.
   DNR/DNI).  All plans will be continued as outlined in current notes,
   including medications, additional immuneomodulators, and XRT, with hope
   to allow pt. to return home.  Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**], who is in
   agreement.  This information was also discussed with the patient
   husband.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status, attributed to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and midline shift from a left hemispheric CNS mass. The patient has been diagnosed with lymphoma (cancer) in the CNS and has undergone Methotrexate and radiation therapy (XRT). Additional Rituximab dose is planned upon completion of XRT. The patient is at risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), hemorrhage into the CNS lesion, and has chronic anemia. The patient's hypertension is acceptable and will be monitored. No evidence of hypercalcemia was found. The patient is currently NPO pending XRT and would benefit from tube feeding (TF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's altered mental status is attributed to increased ICP due to a CNS mass. This can lead to further neurological deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Hemorrhage into CNS lesion: The patient is at risk for hemorrhage into the CNS lesion, which can worsen the patient's condition and lead to significant neurological deficits.
3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in the right upper extremity and is currently receiving Lovenox. The patient remains at risk for developing another DVT or pulmonary embolism.
4. Chronic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may require"

   Assessment and Plan
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS  -- attributed to increased ICP and midline shift
   from left hemispheric CNS mass.  Hope to see improvement with
   treatment, including XRT, decadron, mannitol.  Monitor closely.
   LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID) -- CNS.  s/p
   Methotrexate and XRT. Plan for additional Rituxamab dose upon
   completion of XRT.  Palliative interventions.  Poor prognosis.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 809**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 810**], MD, Neurological Oncology continues care as co-attending
   providing critical contribution to daily patient care.
   DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY -- s/p IVC filter.
   Continues to receive Lovenox full does.  At risk for hemorrhage into
   CNS lesion, may consider d/c anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA, CHRONIC -- stable.  Monitor Hct, esp while receiving
   anticoagulation.
   HYPERTENSION -- acceptable, allow higher BP per Neurooncology.  Monitor
   BP.  No evidence for
   HYPERCALCEMIA  -- improved.  Monitor Ca++.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending XRT.  Poor status.  Would benefit

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum. She underwent three cycles of methotrexate therapy and was admitted to the ICU for scheduled methotrexate/rituximab dosing. The patient presented with an acute mental status decline. Her current condition is as follows: 
- Altered mental status, likely secondary to progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy.
- Mildly improved today but remains non-orientated.
- External beam cranial irradiation is planned per radiation oncology and primary neuro-oncologist.
- Blood cultures: Urine Cx Negative.
- Q4h neuro checks, if acute change then increase mannitol and dexamethasone.
- Intubation required if persistent altered mental status, inability to protect airway.
- CNS lymphoma appears unchanged on MR imaging, currently s/p 4th cycle of methotrexate and rituximab.
- Neuro-oncology and radiation-oncology follow-up.
- Methotrexate level this PM.
- Continue leucovorin and bicarb according to protocol.
- Seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam.
- Anemia responded well to transfusion of 1 U RBCs.
- Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives to allow brain perfusion in setting of increased ICP.
- PICC-associated RUE DVT diagnosed [**2197-6-18**] s/p PICC removal.
- Hyperlipidemia: Not currently on therapy.

Potential medical complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cerebral edema from the CNS lymphoma and methotrexate/rituximab therapy.
2. Risk of seizures due to increased ICP and brain damage.
3. Potential bleeding complications from the use of anticoagulants (heparin) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 174 K/uL).
4. Hypotension and/or arrhythmias due to beta-blocker hold and increased ICP.
5. Risk of deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum with some associated edema and mass effect. She was admitted to the ICU for scheduled Methotrexate/Rituximab dosing and subsequently developed acute mental status decline.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 167/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include general more wakefulness today, not oriented, difficulty following commands, and improving mental status. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. Pulmonary examination shows breathing comfortably with no wheezes or crackles. Abdominal examination is soft with no tenderness or guarding. Extremities show trace edema at ankles, pulse 2+ symmetric, and a large hematoma on the left shoulder. Neurological examination is limited by the patient's inability to follow commands, with baseline right facial droop, right foot drop, and weakness. The patient moves toes on both sides spontaneously.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1, hemoglobin of 26.7 g/dL, platelet count of 163,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 35 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 97 mEq/L, calcium of 7.8 mg/dL, and magnesium of 1.5 mg/dL. Methotrexate levels have been monitored, ranging from 0.2 to 3.2 mcg/mL.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered mental status. Likely secondary to progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy. Mildly improved today but remains Oriented x 0.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum with associated edema and mass effect. She was admitted for scheduled Methotrexate/Rituximab dosing and transferred to the ICU due to acute mental status decline. The patient has altered mental status, likely secondary to progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy. There are no signs of primary metabolic disorder, but an infectious explanation cannot be excluded. MRI shows no signs of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status decline may be due to the progression of intracranial mass/edema or complications from methotrexate and rituximab therapy. This condition requires close monitoring, and interventions such as pulse dose steroids, mannitol, and dexamethasone should be continued. If there are acute changes, neuro checks should be increased, and mannitol and dexamethasone doses may be increased accordingly.
2. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a PICC-associated right upper extremity DVT. Enoxaparin therapy should be held due to decreasing Hct, and the patient's Hct should be monitored. If it drops below 21, transfusion should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status, likely due to increased intracranial pressure secondary to CNS mass. They have a history of lymphoma, with progressive and non-curative CNS involvement. The patient is receiving radiation therapy (XRT), mannitol, and high-dose steroids. There is suspicion of pneumonia, particularly aspiration-induced, given the presence of left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient remains at risk for pneumonia and should be monitored closely, with a low threshold for empirical antimicrobials. Additionally, the patient has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity and is on Lovenox. Close monitoring is necessary due to the risk of bleeding. The patient also has chronic anemia, hypertension, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia, which have been addressed accordingly. Nutritional support is recommended, including placement of a feeding tube and initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TF). The patient is currently in the ICU, with a code status of full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- overall improved, as pt. more awake.  Likely

   key care.
   PNEUMONIA -- LLL infiltrate, suspect aspiration.  Remains at risk for
   pneumonia, as fevers may be masked by high dose steroids.  Low
   threshold for empirical antimicrobials.
   DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), UPPER EXTREMITY -- on Lovenox.  Monitor
   closely.  At risk for bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with an altered mental status. They have been receiving radiation therapy for lymphoma in the central nervous system. The patient's condition has shown improvement in terms of increased wakefulness and responsiveness. However, they are at risk for pneumonia due to high-dose steroids and aspiration. The patient also has a deep venous thrombosis in the upper extremity, for which they are on Lovenox. Other medical conditions include chronic anemia, hypertension, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia. The patient is being monitored closely, and their nutritional support is being initiated through a feeding tube. They are also receiving medication for stress ulcers and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is set to full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma, currently admitted to the ICU for scheduled methotrexate/rituximab dosing. She presented with acute mental status decline and was found to have a PICC-associated right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient also has chronic anemia, hypertension, hypercalcemia, and altered mental status. Her current medications include pulse dose steroids, mannitol, leucovorin, bicarb, levetiracetam, and prophylactic PPI, insulin sliding scale, heparin SQ, and bowel regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has a history of PICC line placement, which can increase the risk of developing DVT. It is important to monitor for signs of DVT and consider anticoagulation therapy if necessary.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - DVT can potentially lead to PE if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs. Monitoring for symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and hypoxia is essential.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding - The patient's chronic anemia could be due to decreased nutrition and radiation therapy. It is important to monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as black or tarry stools and abdominal pain.
4. Hypercalcemia - The patient has hypercalcemia, which can"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo F with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia,
   left subfrontal and corpus callosum with some associated edema and mass
   effect s/p 3 cycles of methotrexate initially admitted for scheduled
   Methotrexate/Rituximab dosing transferred to the ICU with acute mental
   status decline.
   # Altered mental status.  Improved since admission, unchanged since
   yesterday. Likely secondary to progression of intracranial mass/edema
   and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy.
   - Continue pulse dose steroids and mannitol x 7 days per Neuro-onc.
   - External beam cranial irradiation per radiation oncology and primary
   neuro-oncologist.
   - F/U blood cultures: Urine Cx Negative.
   - Q4h neuro checks, if acute change then Increase mannitol and
   dexamethasone
   #Pain. Overnight was agitated and in pain.  Concern for giving
   narcotics giving altered mental status, but tried 0.5 morphine this am
   with good effect
   --0.5IV Morphine PRN, held for sedation or MS change.
   # CNS lymphoma. Appears to be unchanged on MR imaging. Currently s/p
   4th cycle of methotrexate and rituximab.
   - Neuro-oncology and radiation-oncology following.
   - MTX levels appears to be rising despite no MTX since last Friday.
   Unclear etiology, will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**].  Until MTX level <0.01, will
   continue bicarb infusion.
   - Continue leucovorin and bicarb according to protocol
 d/w neuro-onc
   for methotrexate level at which we can d/c continuous Bicarb infusion
   to keep urine pH<7.5.
   - Continue seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam.
   - Cerebral edema should peak today, will monitor neuro status closely.
   -Will call pharmacy to find out if Keppra comes in liquid form for
   Dobhoff.
   # Anemia. HCT decreased to 18 yesterday, responded appropriately to 1 U
   RBCs.  No signs of overt bleeding, likely secondary to chronic dz,
   decreased nutrition, XRT.
   - Guiac stools
   -f/u PM Hct and transfuse if <21.
   .
   # Hypertension.
   - Hold antihypertensives to allow brain perfusion in setting of
   increased ICP
   - Hold home beta-blocker. Increased intracranial pressure places her at
   risk for bradycardia.
   .
   # PICC-associated RUE DVT. Diagnosed [**2197-6-18**] s/p PICC removal.
   - No enoxaparin therapy due to decreasing Hct.  If HCT stable for 24
   hours, will consider restarting.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia. Not currently on therapy.
   .
   # FEN: Dobhoff inserted yesterday, started on TF.  Repleat lytes as
   needed.  Do not crush pills down dobhoff, should be liquid only.
   # Prophylaxis: PPI , insulin sliding scale, Heparin SQ , bowel regimen.
   # Access: Left PICC line in place.
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 651**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3596**] (c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], (w) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4431**].
   # Code: DNR, Rescusitation would be medically futile.
   # Dispo: ICU as cerebral edema should peak on today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum with associated edema and mass effect. She was admitted for scheduled methotrexate/rituximab dosing and transferred to the ICU due to acute mental status decline. The patient has been experiencing increased agitation and pain, which improved since admission but remained unchanged since yesterday. The likely cause of her altered mental status is the progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or complications of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the progression of intracranial mass/edema.
2. Complications of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy.
3. Pain management, as the patient is experiencing pain and agitation.
4. Anemia with a decreased hematocrit (HCT) level, likely secondary to chronic disease, decreased nutrition, and radiation therapy.
5. Hypertension, which needs to be monitored and managed carefully.
6. PICC-associated right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
7. Hyperlipidemia, which requires monitoring but is not currently on therapy.
8. FEN (likely referring to feeding tube), repletion of electrolytes as needed, and avoiding crushing pills down the Dobhoff tube.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently receiving treatment in the ICU. The patient's chief complaints are weakness and somnolence. The patient underwent radiation therapy on [**2197-7-12**] at 10:28 AM and was found to be more awake but indicating discomfort. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed for tube feeding (TF). Mannitol was decreased, and there were no seizures reported.

The patient's medical history, allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications are documented. The patient has a history of lymphoma (cancer, malignant neoplasm, lymphoid) with CNS mass leading to edema and herniation. The patient is receiving palliative therapy, including continued XRT (radiation therapy), mannitol, and decadron.

The patient also has deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, for which lovenox (low molecular weight heparin) is being administered. The patient is also anemic and hypertensive, with plans to monitor these conditions closely. Nutritional support is being provided through tube feeding (TF). Pain management is being achieved with low-dose narcotics.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/89 mmHg to 180/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of radiation therapy, and their chief complaint is weakness and somnolence. The patient's condition has been improving gradually, with reduced intracranial pressure and improved neurologic examination. They have been diagnosed with lymphoma with CNS involvement, resulting in increased intracranial pressure and herniation. The patient is receiving palliative therapy, including continued radiation therapy, mannitol, and decadron. They also have a deep venous thrombosis in the upper extremity, chronic anemia, hypertension, and require nutritional support through tube feeding. Pain management is being provided with low-dose narcotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's lymphoma with CNS involvement can lead to increased ICP, which can cause herniation and be life-threatening. Monitoring the patient's neurologic exam and continuing palliative therapy is essential.
2. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT in the upper extremity, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately. Anticoagulation therapy with lovenox should be continued, and the patient's limb should be monitored for any signs of progression.
3. Chronic anemia: The patient's chronic anemia needs to be monitored to maintain a hemoglobin level above 21. Further evaluation and management of the"

   53 yo F with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia,
   left subfrontal and corpus callosum with some associated edema and mass
   effect s/p 3 cycles of methotrexate initially admitted for scheduled
   Methotrexate/Rituximab dosing transferred to the ICU with acute mental
   status decline.
   # Altered mental status.  Improved since admission, unchanged since
   yesterday. Likely secondary to progression of intracranial mass/edema
   and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy.
   - Continue pulse dose steroids and mannitol x 7 days per Neuro-onc.
   - External beam cranial irradiation per radiation oncology and primary
   neuro-oncologist.
   - F/U blood cultures: Urine Cx Negative.
   - Q4h neuro checks, if acute change then Increase mannitol and
   dexamethasone
   #Pain. Overnight was agitated and in pain.  Concern for giving
   narcotics giving altered mental status, but tried 0.5 morphine this am
   with good effect
   --0.5IV Morphine PRN, held for sedation or MS change.
   # CNS lymphoma. Appears to be unchanged on MR imaging. Currently s/p
   4th cycle of methotrexate and rituximab.
   - Neuro-oncology and radiation-oncology following.
   - MTX levels appears to be rising despite no MTX since last Friday.
   Unclear etiology, will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**].  Until MTX level <0.01, will
   continue bicarb infusion.
   - Continue leucovorin and bicarb according to protocol
 d/w neuro-onc
   for methotrexate level at which we can d/c continuous Bicarb infusion
   to keep urine pH<7.5.
   - Continue seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam.
   - Cerebral edema should peak today, will monitor neuro status closely.
   -will obtain head CT to establish baseline, per neuro-onc
   # Anemia. HCT decreased to 18 yesterday, responded appropriately to 1 U
   RBCs.  No signs of overt bleeding, likely secondary to chronic dz,
   decreased nutrition, XRT.
   - Guiac stools
   -f/u PM Hct and transfuse if <21.
   # Hypertension.
   - Hold antihypertensives to allow brain perfusion in setting of
   increased ICP
    - Hold home beta-blocker. Increased intracranial pressure places her
   at risk for bradycardia.
   # PICC-associated RUE DVT. Diagnosed [**2197-6-18**] s/p PICC removal.
   - No enoxaparin therapy due to decreasing Hct.  If HCT stable for 24
   hours, will consider restarting.
   # Hyperlipidemia. Not currently on therapy.
   # FEN: Dobhoff inserted yesterday, started on TF.  Repleat lytes as
   needed.  Do not crush pills down dobhoff, should be liquid only.
   # Prophylaxis: PPI , insulin sliding scale, Heparin SQ , bowel regimen.
   # Access: Left PICC line in place.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum with some associated edema and mass effect. She has been admitted for scheduled Methotrexate/Rituximab dosing and transferred to the ICU due to acute mental status decline.

The patient's current condition shows improvement since admission, but her mental status remains unchanged since yesterday. The likely cause of her altered mental status is believed to be the progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or a complication of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy.

The plan of care includes continuing pulse dose steroids and mannitol for 7 days per Neuro-onc, external beam cranial irradiation per radiation oncology and primary neuro-oncologist, and following up blood cultures. The patient is also scheduled for a head CT to establish a baseline, per neuro-onc.

Other ongoing concerns include pain management, CNS lymphoma, anemia, hypertension, PICC-associated right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hyperlipidemia, and fenestrated endotracheal nutrition (FEN).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure leading to potential brain herniation, further decline in mental status, infection due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines, bleeding complications from thrombocytopenia, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS lymphoma involving the basal ganglia, left subfrontal and corpus callosum. She has been treated with methotrexate and rituximab therapy and was admitted to the ICU for scheduled dosing. The patient presented with acute mental status decline, likely secondary to progression of intracranial mass/edema and/or complications of ongoing methotrexate and rituximab therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has declined acutely, which may be due to the progression of intracranial mass/edema or complications from methotrexate and rituximab therapy. Close monitoring of neurological status is necessary.
2. Pain management: The patient was agitated and in pain overnight, and there is concern about administering narcotics due to altered mental status. Morphine has been given with good effect, but further pain management should be carefully assessed and managed.
3. Methotrexate toxicity: Despite not receiving methotrexate since last Friday, methotrexate levels appear to be rising. This could indicate methotrexate toxicity, and bicarbonate infusion will continue until methotrexate levels are below 0.01.
4. Anemia: The patient's HCT decreased to 18 yesterday, indicating anemia. She responded appropriately to 1 unit of RBCs, and further transfusion may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with increased intracranial pressure attributed to CNS lymphoma. The patient is receiving palliative care and a head CT is planned to document radiographic improvement. Additionally, the patient has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, which is associated with the PICC line. The patient is also diagnosed with chronic anemia and benign hypertension. The patient's pain is managed with morphine.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113-166/67-101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, and normal pupils without scleral edema. The cardiovascular examination is normal with a sinus rhythm. The respiratory system is clear bilaterally, and the abdominal examination shows soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, purposeful movement, and decreased muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 23.7%, platelet count of 188 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from "

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with increased intracranial pressure attributed to CNS lymphoma. They have shown improvement with the current course of therapy, including radiation treatment (XRT), dexamethasone (decadron), and mannitol. The patient also has a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, which is associated with a PICC line. Other conditions include chronic anemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia likely due to high-dose steroids, and diffuse pain that responds to morphine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased Intracranial Pressure: The patient's condition of increased intracranial pressure can lead to further neurological deterioration if not properly managed. This may result in decreased level of consciousness, seizures, or even brain herniation.

2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of a DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if a clot were to dislodge and travel to the lungs. This could potentially lead to acute respiratory distress and hypoxia.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia, likely caused by high-dose steroids, needs to be closely monitored. If uncontrolled, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, both of which are life-threatening conditions.

4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be closely monitored, as poorly"
