","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have undergone an ERCP procedure, had a right femoral line placed, and started continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient is on multiple infusions including fentanyl, midazolam, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and norepinephrine. They also receive other ICU medications and have no known drug allergies. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

Vital signs and flow sheet data are provided, showing stable temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation within normal ranges. The patient is hemodynamically stable with adequate fluid balance, and their blood gases are within acceptable limits.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is sedated but has regular heart rhythm, clear lung sounds on ventilation, and no murmurs or gallop. The abdomen is described as obese with bilateral lower extremity edema. The femoral line site is noted to be oozing blood.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low glucose, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and plan include ongoing ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and management of various lines and catheters. The patient is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have undergone several procedures, including ERCP and CVVH, and are currently receiving multiple medications for pain and sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with normal temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. However, there are concerns regarding their fluid balance and kidney function. The patient's total fluid input exceeds their output, indicating possible fluid overload. Additionally, the patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting impaired kidney function. The patient's white blood cell count is also significantly elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an INR of 3.3, indicating a bleeding tendency. The patient has a history of sepsis, and their blood culture results show growth of gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload: The excessive fluid input compared to output may lead to fluid overload, which can result in pulmonary edema, increased body weight, and compromised cardiac function.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. This can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the body, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid retention.
3. Infection: The patient's high white blood cell count and positive blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male with Down Syndrome and history of ESRD on HD, SVC on
   coumadin and recent history of choledocholithiasis who presents with
   sepsis secondary to cholangitis.
   #Sepsis: etiology bacterial cholangitis.  Pt blood pressure stable on
   low dose levophed pressor (0.2) will continue to wean.
   -Will d/c femoral line when bp stable off of pressors.
   -Limit fluid boluses due to ESRD.
   # Respiratory failure: elective intubation prior to procedure.  Pt
   doing will on volume control.  Pt currently too sedated to be weaned to
   pressure support.   Will lighten sedation and repeat trial of PSV.
   - Obtain CXR to verify placement of ET tube.
   -Current sedation fentanyl/versed gtt
   #Bacteremia: likely secondary to cholangitis;
   -GNR and GPR on culture;
   -continue zosyn and vanco; will consider extending spectrum for double
   coverage of pseudomonas while awaiting sensitivities.  - -Cultures
   likely drawn from HD catheter.  Will notify renal and determine if
   catheter needs immediate replacement.
   -Order Echo today to look for vegetations.
   #Cholangitis: Definitive treatment with ERCP yesterday. Pus drained and
   stent removed.  New stent put in place.  Stone was not removed.
   -          Continue to monitor LFTs and serial abdominal exam.  If LFT
   elevation persists will notify ERCP team for repeat intervention.
   Otherwise repeat ERCP scheduled for 1 month.
   -          Continue PPI IV BID
   # ESRD: will continue on CVVH until pt is off pressors and pt is
   extubated; will likely resume regularly scheduled HD; continue to
   renally dose medications, discuss need for new catheter.
   #SVC syndrome: hold on restarting anticoagulation until INR in
   therapeutic range and until it is less likely that he will need a
   repeat procedure.
   # Access: HD port, R femoral line (to be removed when no longer need
   pressors), R forearm IV
   #Code: reverse to DNR/DNI after extubation
   #Dispo: will go to floor after extubation and termination of CVVH

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male with Down Syndrome and history of ESRD on HD, SVC on
   coumadin and recent history of choledocholithiasis who presents with
   sepsis secondary to cholangitis.
   #Sepsis: etiology bacterial cholangitis.  Pt blood pressure stable on
   low dose levophed pressor (0.2) will continue to wean.
   -Will d/c femoral line when bp stable off of pressors.
   -Limit fluid boluses due to ESRD.
   # Respiratory failure: elective intubation prior to procedure.  Pt
   doing will on volume control.  Pt currently too sedated to be weaned to
   pressure support.   Will lighten sedation and repeat trial of PSV.
   - Obtain CXR to verify placement of ET tube.
   -Current sedation fentanyl/versed gtt
   #Bacteremia: likely secondary to cholangitis;
   -GNR and GPR on culture;
   -continue zosyn and vanco; will consider extending spectrum for double
   coverage of pseudomonas while awaiting sensitivities.  - -Cultures
   likely drawn from HD catheter.  Will notify renal and determine if
   catheter needs immediate replacement.
   -Order Echo today to look for vegetations.
   #Cholangitis: Definitive treatment with ERCP yesterday. Pus drained and
   stent removed.  New stent put in place.  Stone was not removed.
   -          Continue to monitor LFTs and serial abdominal exam.  If LFT
   elevation persists will notify ERCP team for repeat intervention.
   Otherwise repeat ERCP scheduled for 1 month.
   -          Continue PPI IV BID
   # ESRD: will continue on CVVH until pt is off pressors and pt is
   extubated; will likely resume regularly scheduled HD; continue to
   renally dose medications, discuss need for new catheter.
   #SVC syndrome: hold on restarting anticoagulation until INR in
   therapeutic range and until it is less likely that he will need a
   repeat procedure.
   # Access: HD port, R femoral line (to be removed when no longer need
   pressors), R forearm IV
   #Code: reverse to DNR/DNI after extubation
   #Dispo: will go to floor after extubation and termination of CVVH

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with Down Syndrome and a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), as well as superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome on coumadin. He presented with sepsis secondary to cholangitis, which was likely caused by bacterial infection in the biliary tract. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), and ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). His current condition is stable, but there are potential complications that can arise, such as respiratory failure, bacteremia, cholangitis, ESRD, and SVC syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma if the pressure in the lungs becomes too high.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, which means bacteria are present in the bloodstream. This can lead to septicemia, a more severe form of infection that can affect multiple organs.

3. Cholangitis: The patient underwent ERCP for definitive treatment of cholangitis. However, there is a risk of recurrence if the stone was not completely removed or if the infection persists.

4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease, which requires ongoing"

   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations
   are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally
   normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality; no obvious vegetations seen but
   cannot be excluded on the basis of this study; If clinically indicated,
   a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male with Down Syndrome and history of ESRD on HD, SVC on
   coumadin and recent history of choledocholithiasis who presents with
   sepsis secondary to cholangitis.
   #Sepsis: etiology most likely bacterial cholangitis.  Organisms c/w gut
   flora.  Sepsis worsening on current abx coverage (see below)
   -Titrate levofed and vasopressin to keep MAP >65  (only marker to
   follow at this point as no CVP and no UOP)
   -Limit fluid boluses due to ESRD
 continue CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: elective intubation prior to ERCP procedure.
   Patient with poor RSBI this morning.  Likely evolving ARDS picture.
   - Change vent settings compy with ARDs protocol (based on height)
   decrease VT to 450cc, and increase RR to 18.
   - Obtain repeat CXR to eval PTX
   -Current sedation fentanyl/versed gtt
   #Bacteremia: likely secondary to cholangitis.  Concern for coexisting
   line infection vs. gut ischemia/perforation as common source for mixed
   bacteremia
   -GNR and GPC (enterococcus) on Cx.
   - Patient on Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Zosyn.  Will broaden coverage
   to include VRE (linezolid PO)
   -Obtain RUQ ultrasound and then CT scan of abdomen.
   -Follow up with ERCP re: increasing LFTs and worsening infection in
   face of ERCP 2 days ago with stone left in place and need for further
   intervention.
   -continue zosyn and vanco; will consider extending spectrum for double
   coverage of pseudomonas while awaiting sensitivities.  - -Need to
   replace HD catheter
 placed at OSH will consult IR vs surgery for
   replacement.
   -Consider follow up TEE for endocarditis.
   # SVT
 Patient with several episodes of AVNRT vs. Aflutter requiring
   adenosine and dilt drip overnight for rhythm and HR control.  Patient
   has been in sinus since late last night.  Concern that element of
   volume overload is increasing Right atrial and leading to arrhythmia.
   Also high dose of levophed may be contributing as well.
   -          will turn off dilt now (weaned down to lowest dose
   overnight)
   -           will wean down on levophed as tolerated.
   -          Once off levophed, renal team can adjust CVVH to take off
   50cc/hr.
   #Cholangitis: s/p ERCP 2 days ago --pus drained and stent removed.  New
   stent put in place.  Stone was not removed.
    - notify ERCP team of worsening LFTs and need for repeat
   intervention.
   -   Continue PPI IV BID
   -  d/c atorvastatin
   # ESRD: will continue on CVVH until pt is off pressors and pt is
   extubated; will likely resume regularly scheduled HD; continue to
   renally dose medications.
   - need new  HD catheter today.
   #SVC syndrome: INR is 5.0 today.  hold on restarting anticoagulation
   until INR in therapeutic range and until it is less likely that he will
   need a repeat procedure.
   # Access: HD port
 need to change, R femoral line, R forearm IV
   # Prophylaxis: ISS, holding anticoagulation.
   #Code: reverse to DNR/DNI after extubation
   #Dispo: ICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with Down Syndrome and a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), superior vena cava (SVC) on coumadin, and recent history of choledocholithiasis who presents with septic shock secondary to cholangitis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. He has been receiving vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including ESRD, SVC syndrome, and a recent ERCP procedure. Laboratory findings indicate sepsis with a mixed bacterial infection involving Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC), including Enterococcus species. Imaging studies suggest the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and potential pulmonary thromboembolism. An echocardiogram reveals signs of diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased left ventricular filling pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's worsening septic physiology with hypotension and fever suggests ongoing infection. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage targeting the identified organisms and consider extending the spectrum to cover pseudomonas while awaiting sensitivities.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure, increased interstitial fluid on chest X-ray, and poor respiratory system compliance"

   ECG: ECHO--Suggestion of increaed LVEDP and has preserved EF but
   signficiant [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement which may pre-dispose to atrial
   arrhythmia
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male admitted with biliary sepsis.  He now has evidence of
   continued hypotension which is likely a manifestation of ongoing sepsis
   but now with recurrent atrial arrhythmias has had worsening
   hypotension.  Despite optimal ABX and pressor titration he has had
   worsening hypoxemia despite ongoing CVVH for control of volume status.
   This picture may well be one of significant biliary sepsis with
   polymicrobial infection seen in blood culture results and no clear new
   source has been identified.  The increase in FIO2 requirement likely
   represents some significant evidence of lung injury in this setting.
   This represents clinical worsening despite ERCP intervention and has
   increasing LFT's suggestive of continued obstruction proximal to
   pancreatic duct.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Levohed/Vasopressin
   -Levoflox/Zosyn/Vanco
   -We have concern for persistent biliary source given the findings
   although abdominal source alternatively is possible and perhaps quite
   likely.  For evaluation of alternative sources would consider
Dialysis
   catheter as persistent nidus of infection.
   -Would change dialysis catheter today
   -Would evaluate abdomen for focal collection with CT with contrast and
   pursue RUQ U/S
   -Wean Levophed further if possible with MAP maintained at >60mmHg
   -Add Linezolid now given worsening
   2)Acute Respiratory Failure-
   -He likely has a component of increased LVEDP given atrial enlargement,
   but, in the setting of minimal volume changes has evolved significant
   pulmonary edema and hypoxemia which is strongly suggestive of
   significant acute lung injury.
   -Given further decline and persistent sepsis will have prolonged course
   for treatment.
   -Move to low tidal volume strategy
   --Titrate PEEP up with goal to wean FIO2
   -Keep Ve-10 lpm
   -F/U ABG
   2.5)AVNRT-
   -Dilt gtt needed for rate control
   -Pt with clear predisposition to atrial arrhthmia with stress will
   likely be recurrent
   -Continue dilt gtt.
   3)Chronic Renal Failure-
   -Nephrocaps
   -Continue CVVH in the setting of hemodynamic instability.
   -Catheter change needed
   4)SVC Syndrome
   -Will need continued anticoagulation
   -F/U INR and return to heparin if INR normalizes.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will need to move to po (NGT) feeds towards goal

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male admitted with biliary sepsis. The patient's condition has been worsening despite optimal antibiotic therapy and pressor titration. The patient now shows evidence of continued hypotension, recurrent atrial arrhythmias, worsening hypoxemia, and lung injury. The patient also has chronic renal failure and SVC syndrome.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, and there is a concern for persistent biliary source given the findings. Alternative sources of infection should be evaluated, and the patient may require a change in dialysis catheter.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed significant pulmonary edema and hypoxemia, which suggests acute lung injury. Treatment will involve a low tidal volume strategy, titration of PEEP, and weaning of FiO2.

3. AVNRT (Atrial Fibrillation): The patient has a predisposition to atrial arrhythmias, and recurrent episodes of AVNRT have been observed. Diltiazem will be continued for rate control.

4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and CVVH will be continued in the setting of hemodynamic instability. A catheter change is needed.

5. SVC Syndrome: The patient requires continued anticoagulation and close monitoring of INR levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently in the ICU due to septic shock, respiratory failure, and cholangitis resulting from biliary obstruction. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [**6-15**] which revealed a clotted biliary stent and ampullary pus. Four stones were removed, and two stents were placed. The patient's antibiotics were changed to meropenem for pan-resistant Klebsiella and linezolid for enterococcal bacteremia. He received 1 mg of vit K and 8 U FFP for an INR of 5.0 prior to ERCP, and his intravenous catheter was changed. The patient has been sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently improving from ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) in the setting of septic shock. However, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing fluid overload and the need for further sedation reduction.
2. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock secondary to cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction. There is a risk of deterioration and potential endocarditis, especially considering the polymicrobial bacteremia"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male with Down Syndrome and history of ESRD on HD, SVC on
   coumadin and recent history of choledocholithiasis who presents with
   sepsis secondary to cholangitis.
   #Sepsis: etiology most likely bacterial cholangitis.  Organisms c/w gut
   flora.  Sepsis worsening on current abx coverage (see below)
   -Titrate levofed and vasopressin to keep MAP >65  (only marker to
   follow at this point as no CVP and no UOP)
   -Limit fluid boluses due to ESRD
 continue CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: elective intubation prior to ERCP procedure.
   Patient with poor RSBI this morning.  Likely evolving ARDS picture.
   - Change vent settings compy with ARDs protocol (based on height)
   decrease VT to 450cc, and increase RR to 18.
   - Obtain repeat CXR to eval PTX
   -Current sedation fentanyl/versed gtt
   #Bacteremia: likely secondary to cholangitis.  Concern for coexisting
   line infection vs. gut ischemia/perforation as common source for mixed
   bacteremia
   -GNR and GPC (enterococcus) on Cx.
   - Patient on Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Zosyn.  Will broaden coverage
   to include VRE (linezolid PO)
   -Obtain RUQ ultrasound and then CT scan of abdomen.
   -Follow up with ERCP re: increasing LFTs and worsening infection in
   face of ERCP 2 days ago with stone left in place and need for further
   intervention.
   -continue zosyn and vanco; will consider extending spectrum for double
   coverage of pseudomonas while awaiting sensitivities.  - -Need to
   replace HD catheter
 placed at OSH will consult IR vs surgery for
   replacement.
   -Consider follow up TEE for endocarditis.
   # SVT
 Patient with several episodes of AVNRT vs. Aflutter requiring
   adenosine and dilt drip overnight for rhythm and HR control.  Patient
   has been in sinus since late last night.  Concern that element of
   volume overload is increasing Right atrial and leading to arrhythmia.
   Also high dose of levophed may be contributing as well.
   -          will turn off dilt now (weaned down to lowest dose
   overnight)
   -           will wean down on levophed as tolerated.
   -          Once off levophed, renal team can adjust CVVH to take off
   50cc/hr.
   #Cholangitis: s/p ERCP 2 days ago --pus drained and stent removed.  New
   stent put in place.  Stone was not removed.
    - notify ERCP team of worsening LFTs and need for repeat
   intervention.
   -   Continue PPI IV BID
   -  d/c atorvastatin
   # ESRD: will continue on CVVH until pt is off pressors and pt is
   extubated; will likely resume regularly scheduled HD; continue to
   renally dose medications.
   - need new  HD catheter today.
   #SVC syndrome: INR is 5.0 today.  hold on restarting anticoagulation
   until INR in therapeutic range and until it is less likely that he will
   need a repeat procedure.
   # Access: HD port
 need to change, R femoral line, R forearm IV
   # Prophylaxis: ISS, holding anticoagulation.
   #Code: reverse to DNR/DNI after extubation
   #Dispo: ICU for now.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Sepsis: The etiology is most likely bacterial cholangitis. Organisms corresponding to gut flora. Sepsis is worsening despite current antibiotic coverage.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has poor respiratory system function, which may indicate evolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ventilator settings need to be adjusted according to ARDS protocol.
3. Bacteremia: Likely secondary to cholangitis. There is concern for coexisting line infection versus gut ischemia/perforation as common sources for mixed bacteremia.
4. SVT (supraventricular tachycardia): The patient has had several episodes of AVNRT (atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia) or atrial flutter, requiring adenosine and diltiazem drip overnight for rhythm and heart rate control.

   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis +/- hypovolemia.  Improved with
   current therapy.  Now off vasopressors.
   RENAL FAILURE -- tolerating CVVH.  Hope to transition back to

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. The patient has severe sepsis, cholangitis, bacteremia, hypotension, and renal failure. 

The patient's respiratory failure is due to being intubated in the context of sepsis, possibly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ERCP. There is an ongoing effort to work towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and extubation trials.

The source of sepsis is believed to be from the gastrointestinal tract, polymicrobial in nature, and has responded well to current therapy. Antimicrobials will be continued, and supportive care will be provided.

Cholangitis is caused by cholelithiasis and has improved following ERCP and removal of stones and decompression of purulence. Antimicrobials will also be continued for cholangitis.

Bacteremia is caused by Klebsiella (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing) and Enterococcus. Appropriate antibiotics (meropenem and linezolid) will be continued, likely originating from the gastrointestinal tract, and treatment will continue after removal of stones.

Hypotension is attributed to sepsis, possibly in combination with hypovolemia, but has improved with current therapy and the patient is now off vasopressors.

Renal failure is being tolerated with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). As the patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is septic shock with bacteremia secondary to cholangitis. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure on [6-15] for biliary obstruction, which resulted in improvement of clinical symptoms but was complicated by bacteremia with pan-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecium.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, septic shock, and cholangitis. The respiratory failure is improving ARDS, and the patient is adequately oxygenated and ventilated on current ventilator settings. The septic shock is being managed with appropriate antibiotics, restart of levophed if necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65, volume status management with continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) or hemodialysis (HD), and continuation of antibiotics.

The patient also has a polymicrobial bacteremia likely from a biliary source, and if the patient's condition worsens, consideration should be given to transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis. Linezolid should be continued for Enterococcus coverage, and meropenem should be continued for Klebsiella coverage until susceptibility results are available.

The patient's coagulopathy has improved with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but chronic coumad"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with septic shock secondary to cholangitis and bacteremia. The patient's current condition is improving, but he still requires low-dose levophed for blood pressure support. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was restarted last night.

The patient has been experiencing continuous oozing from the catheter site for over 9 hours, despite constant pressure and correction of coagulopathy. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Allergies are not reported.

The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, piperacillin, meropenem, linezolid) and sedatives (fentanyl, midazolam). Other ICU medications include calcium gluconate for CRRT and norepinephrine for blood pressure support.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/43 to 175/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a volume control mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expir"

    .
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP 10); Will attempt to decrease PEEP today in attempt to increase
   afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.
   -lighten sedation, consider attempting PSV trial (15/10) today with
   increased fluid removal and decreased PEEP.
   -improve fluid overload with negative balance by CVVH (goal is
   -100cc/hr); will consider returning to intermittent HD tomorrow if no

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for septic shock, respiratory failure, cholangitis, and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient's condition is stable but requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on volume control ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 cc and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 10. There are plans to decrease PEEP today and attempt to lighten sedation and consider pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial.
2. Sepsis: The patient has resolved septic shock but remains at risk for recurrent sepsis. He will continue to be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, white blood cell count, and liver function tests.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia, likely from a biliary source. If his condition worsens, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be performed to rule out endocarditis.
4. Bleeding: The patient had increased bleeding but has currently resolved. However, mild oozing persists from the femoral line site. He received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to improve clot"

   Assessment and Plan
   Severe sepsis, cholangitis (choledocolithiasis) --> s/p ERCP extraction
   of stones.
   Respiratory Failure -- persistent.  main obstacle to extubation is
   volume status --> would desire net negative if tollerated.  Will also
   require reduction of sedatives.  Hope to work towards SBT and
   extubation trial.  (Originally DNR/DNI, but intubated to allow ERCP).
   Cholangitis -- improved clinically, s/p ERCP extraction of stones.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   Bacteremia -- polymicrobial (Klebsiella, Enterococcus).  Highly
   resistent Klebsiella.  Await repeat culture sensitivities.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   Renal Failure -- continue CVVH.  Hopefully transition to HD.
   Hypotension -- resumed Levophed, likely due to increased sedation and
   increased PEEP.
   SVC syndrome -- hold anticoagulation.  Will need to resume.  Consult
   with IR ERCP to determine timing for resuming anticoagulation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient has severe sepsis and cholangitis, which led to emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) extraction of stones.
- The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.
- There is ongoing bleeding/oozing from the hemodialysis catheter site, but it has stopped after administering blood products and dDAVP.
- The patient is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with a net volume loss.
- Sedation requirements have increased.
- Levophed was resumed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
- The patient has a history of bacteremia with polymicrobial infection, including highly resistant Klebsiella.
- Renal failure continues, and CVVH is being continued, hopefully transitioning to hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient has hypotension, which is likely due to increased sedation and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is present, and anticoagulation needs to be held temporarily. Consultation with interventional radiology (IR) ERCP is required for determining the timing to resume anticoagulation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Severe sepsis, cholangitis (choledocolithiasis) --> s/p ERCP extraction
   of stones.
   Respiratory Failure -- persistent.  main obstacle to extubation is
   volume status --> would desire net negative if tollerated.  Will also
   require reduction of sedatives.  Hope to work towards SBT and
   extubation trial.  (Originally DNR/DNI, but intubated to allow ERCP).
   Cholangitis -- improved clinically, s/p ERCP extraction of stones.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   Bacteremia -- polymicrobial (Klebsiella, Enterococcus).  Highly
   resistent Klebsiella.  Await repeat culture sensitivities.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   Renal Failure -- continue CVVH.  Hopefully transition to HD.
   Hypotension -- resumed Levophed, likely due to increased sedation and
   increased PEEP.
   SVC syndrome -- hold anticoagulation.  Will need to resume.  Consult
   with IR ERCP to determine timing for resuming anticoagulation.
   Bleeding
 now controlled.  Suspect heparin in line contributed to
   persistent oozing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient experienced persistent bleeding/oozing from the HD catheter site throughout the day yesterday but stopped after receiving blood products and dDAVP. The patient is tolerating CVVH with a net volume loss. Increased sedation was required, and Levophed was resumed to maintain MAP > 60 mmHg. The patient has a history of severe sepsis, cholangitis (choledocolithiasis) treated with ERCP extraction of stones, respiratory failure, renal failure, hypotension, SVC syndrome, bacteremia, and bleeding. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/45 to 175/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, overweight/obese, and Down's syndrome facies. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's plan includes continued antimicrobial therapy, CVVH, reduction of sedatives, and an attempt at spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He presented with septic shock and respiratory failure due to biliary obstruction and cholangitis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm on PEEP 10). He is also receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and intermittent HD. The patient has been diagnosed with polymicrobial bacteremia, likely of biliary origin, and is being treated with linezolid for enterococcus and meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia. He also has increased bleeding tendencies but has improved with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's SVC syndrome complicates venous access, and he is currently on a femoral line. He requires ongoing monitoring and management of his condition. Potential complications that can arise include recurrent sepsis, endocarditis, DIC, hemolysis, and re-clotting of biliary stents."

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  8 today ); Will attempt to decrease PEEP today in attempt to
   increase afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.
   Will increase RR from 12 to 16 to help blow off additional CO2 given
   ABG this a.m. with academia (pH 7.26) .
   -lighten sedation, consider attempting PSV trial tomorrow if RSBI
   improves and after more fluid removed from lungs, will evaluate [**6-19**]
   a.m. CXR and continue with negative balance goals via CVVH (goal is
   -100cc/hr); and advance to HD today .  consider returning to
   intermittent HD tomorrow if no longer dependent on pressors.
   Overnight RISD 168 and worsening edema on CXR today  indicative of
   unfavorable extubation now.  Will con
t adjust wean phentanyl and
   versed and focus on fluid overload reduction today with goal extubation
   deferred for a day or two.
   #Septic shock
 cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction s/p
   ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved; intermittent
   hypotension is most likely secondary to bleeding, withdrawal of fluid,
   and increased sedation;  decreased temp most likely due to infusions
   from CVVH. Will continue to monitor temp, WBC, and LFT
s for signs of
   recurrent sepsis.
   -try to wean off of Levophed today as BPs improving. Goal to maintain
   MAP > 65
   #Polymicrobial bacteremia /ID
 likely biliary source; if
   deteriorates, consider TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl)
   -cont. linezolid for enterococcus (c/f VRE given worsening clinical
   status on vanco)
   -cont. meropenem and tygacycline for klebsiella
 suspected carbapenem
   resistant  organism , but final labs to CDC pending. Will still
   continue meropenem w/ double coverage for now.  Will continue to follow
   daily ID recs.
   - follow up on additional sensitivities that were added in setting of
   wide spread resistance.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
 not a candidate for other line
   site given h/o SVC syndrome
   - will continue femoral line for now; continue to monitor for si/sx of
   infection; clean on exam today, continue serial repeat blood cx
   monitoring for now
   - will evaluate for possible PICC in future (may be required for long
   term IV abx for bacteremia)
   -appreciate ID recs; consulting/following
   #Increased bleeding
 has currently resolved; no longer bleeding from
   catheter site or femoral line site.  Improved since given  vitamin K
   and FFP, c/f DIC or hemolysis but fibrinogen WNL, no schistocytes on
   smear; per GI will need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10
   days s/p  ERCP
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily
   # ESRD
 volume status has been kept even with citrate-bath CVVH
   -will advance from CVVH to HD, and wean patient off of pressors
   -tunneled HD cath changed [**2108-6-16**] by IR
   -renally dose meds, started phosphorus supplementation and Epogen dose
   to start [**6-18**]
   .
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   #FEN  --will start OG tube feeds today for nutrition, repleting lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient presented with septic shock, respiratory failure, and cholangitis due to biliary obstruction after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient is currently intubated and on volume-controlled ventilation. There are concerns about fluid overload, as indicated by worsening edema on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has improved since starting continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and hemodialysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, as indicated by decreased lung sounds at the bases and decreased tidal volume. The patient is currently on volume-controlled ventilation with a set rate of 12 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 450 mL. There is a plan to increase the respiratory rate to 16 breaths per minute to help eliminate excess carbon dioxide. The patient's ABG results show academia (pH 7.26), which suggests the need for increased ventilation.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,592 mL since midnight, indicating ongoing fluid overload. This is further supported by the worsening edema on chest X-ray. Efforts are being made to remove excess fluid through CVVH and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of decreased mentation and respiratory distress. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone multiple interventions, including ERCP, dialysis, and invasive ventilation.

Overnight, the patient's condition remained stable with no acute events or fever. The patient's RIS (likely referring to their medical record information system) shows that their versed dosage has been decreased, but the Phentanyl dosage has not been adjusted, making extubation unlikely at this time.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is reported as okay, allowing for the initiation of tube feeds via NG (nasogastric) tube placement. However, anticoagulation is still being held for 10 days post-ERCP.

A new note indicates the presence of carbapenemase resistance, and the patient is now on Tigacycline. Renal supplementation with Phos and Epogen was started yesterday.

Blood cultures were taken at 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM on June 17th, 2108. The invasive ventilation was stopped at 11:00 PM on June 17th, 2108.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on June 15th, Levofloxacin on June 15th, Piperacillin on June 15th, Meropenem on June 17th, and Linezolid"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of being on invasive ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics due to an infection. The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.5 degrees Celsius. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes show low potassium and calcium levels. The patient's blood cultures were taken multiple times, indicating a possible ongoing infection. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl for pain management, calcium gluconate through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), midazolam for sedation, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. 

The patient's physical examination shows that peripheral vascular pulses and skin assessment were not done. Neurologic assessment was also not performed. 

The patient's disposition is mentioned as DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He presented with septic shock and respiratory failure secondary to biliary obstruction and cholangitis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). 

The patient has been stabilized on volume control ventilation and is currently receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with CVVH. He is also on multiple antibiotics due to polymicrobial bacteremia, likely from a biliary source. Tigecycline and meropenem have been added due to suspected carbapenem-resistant bacteria. 

The patient's bleeding has resolved, but he remains off anticoagulation due to SVC syndrome and the risk of re-clotting biliary stents. His renal function is being managed with intermittent hemodialysis, and he has started phosphorus supplementation and erythropoietin. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently stable on volume control ventilation, but there may be a need to decrease PEEP to increase afterload and reduce dependence on pressors. Sedation will be lightened, and a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) may be attempted.

2. Sepsis: The patient had resolved sepsis but may require continued monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory failure
   2) Hypotension
   3) Bacteremia
   4) Acute renal failure
   5) Anemia
   6) Coagulopathy
   7) Metabolic acidosis
   8) SVC syndrome
   Patient has good oxygenation. Respiratory system compliance is normal,
   suggesting that inability to wean may be related to respiratory muscle
   function or sedation. Will continue to wean sedation. Increase
   respiratory frequency to 16 to get PaCO2 to about 35 and pH to above
   7.30. Continue to achieve negative fluid balance with dialysis.
   Metabolic acidosis likely related to ongoing renal failure.
   Antibiotics altered to address resistant organisms.
   Coagulopathy has been corrected.
   Patient requiring small doses of norepi. Would consider restarting
   vasopressin.
   Access remains a problem.
   Hct stable. No need for transfusion now.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  5  today ); Decreased PEEP yesturday  in attempt to increase
   afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.  Increased
   RR from 12 to 16 to help blow off additional CO2 given ABG this [**6-18**]
   with academia (pH 7.26)  and CO2 44, improved today with ABG showing pH
   7.37 and CO2 32 today .
   -lighten sedation, consider attempting PSV trial tomorrow if RSBI
   improves and after more fluid removed from lungs, will re-evaluate  CXR
   to r/o RUL collapse as initial film poor quality, rotated.
   -Continue with negative balance goals via CVVH (goal is -30cc/hr); and
   advance to HD as hemodynamics and hypotension stabilize and once he is
   fully weaned off of pressors. Still showing some dependence on pressors
   and failed overnight wean, maintain on Vasopressin drip and Levophed
   now and will continue to wean slowly .
   RISD  [**6-18**] was 168 and worsening edema on CXR,  indicative of
   unfavorable extubation, will plan to calculate new RSBI later today
   once sedation weaned, currently down to 25mcg/hr  Fentanyl and mg/hr
   Versed. Extubation goal : likely re-attempt  tomorrow once off of
   sedation and BP stabilized off of pressors
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, wean failed last night. Likely evidence that there is
   lingering hypotensive effect of shock and bacteremia which must be
   further cleared with correct Abx. . Additional obstacles include the
   sedative drugs and fluid overload secondary to ESRD which are further
   complicating effort to maintain a healthy SBP and keep MAP >65.
   -try to wean off of Levophed today again  w/goal to maintain MAP > 65,
   SBP above 100
   #Septic shock
 etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved;
   intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to bleeding,
   withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation;  decreased temp most
   likely due to infusions from CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp, WBC, and LFT
s for signs of recurrent
   sepsis , serial daily blood cultures
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia
 likely biliary source given
   identification Klebsiella and enterococcus ; if deteriorates, consider
   TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl)
   -will cont. linezolid for enterococcus
   -cont. meropenem and cholistin  for klebsiella coverage,  Tigecycline
   discontinued [**6-18**]
 suspected carbapenem resistant  organism , but
   final labs to CDC pending
should be available [**Date range (1) 3823**]. Will continue
   to follow daily ID recs.
   - follow up on additional sensitivities/CDC reports that were added in
   setting of wide spread resistance.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
exploring if  a candidate for
   other line site given h/o SVC syndrome, IR contact[**Name (NI) **] today , will await
   recs /procedure plans
   - will continue femoral line for now until IR places new PICC access
   later today,  continue to monitor for si/sx of infection; clean on exam
   today, continue serial repeat blood cx monitoring for now as above
   - will arrange IR procedure under fluoroscopy for PICC placement and
   alternate access, with plan to  d/c curent femoral line.  PICC needed
   for presumed long term IV abx for bacteremia
   -appreciate ID recs; consulting/following
   #Increased bleeding
 has currently resolved; no longer bleeding from
   catheter site or femoral line site.  Improved since given  vitamin K
   and FFP, c/f DIC or hemolysis but fibrinogen WNL, no schistocytes on
   smear; per GI will need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10
   days s/p  ERCP
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily, type and screen renewed [**6-19**]
   #Endocrine
 continue daily levothyroxine for hypotyroidism, PO to IV
   dose switched from 100 to 50mcg daily
   # ESRD
 volume status has been kept even with citrate-bath CVVH
   -will advance from CVVH to HD as soon as patient off of pressors  (CVVH
   goal -30cc/hr fluid off for now)
   -tunneled HD cath changed [**2108-6-16**] by IR, lines being re-evaluted today
   by IR
   -renally dose meds, started phosphorus supplementation and Epogen dose
   to start [**6-18**], Colistin has been adjusted for renal dosing
   .
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   #Access  - Right femoral and Left Subclavian lines in place, attempting
   to start new IJ with IR today and d/c femoral if possible
   #FEN  --started OG tube feeds with Nutren at 30cc/hr rate last night
   for nutrition, tolerating well,  repleting lytes PRN
   #Social
 will plan family meeting to establish care goals and

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. On admission, the patient was unresponsive with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8. Vital signs at admission included a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 117/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.1°C. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

During the course of ICU stay, the patient received multiple doses of antibiotics (Meropenem, Colistin, and Linezolid) due to suspected sepsis. The patient also received midazolam, fentanyl, calcium gluconate, vasopressin, and norepinephrine infusions for sedation, analgesia, blood pressure management, and vasoconstriction.

The patient's laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 21 mg/dL. The patient's renal function was impaired with a creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL. Other laboratory abnormalities included hyponatremia, hyperkalemia,"

   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  5  today ); Decreased PEEP yesturday  in attempt to increase
   afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.  Increased
   RR from 12 to 16 to help blow off additional CO2 given ABG this [**6-18**]
   with academia (pH 7.26)  and CO2 44, improved today with ABG showing pH
   7.37 and CO2 32 today .
   -lighten sedation, consider attempting PSV trial tomorrow if RSBI
   improves and after more fluid removed from lungs, will evaluate [**6-19**]
   a.m. CXR and continue with negative balance goals via CVVH (goal is
   -100cc/hr); and advance to HD as hemodynamics and hypotension
   stabilize. Still showing some dependence on pressors and failed
   overnight wean, still on Vasopressin drip and levophed now, will
   continue to wean.
   RISD  [**6-18**] was 168 and worsening edema on CXR,  indicative of
   unfavorable extubation, will plan to calculate new RSBI later today.
   Will con
t  wean phentanyl and versed and focus on fluid overload
   reduction today with goal extubation deferred for a day or two.
   #Septic shock
 cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction s/p
   ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved; intermittent
   hypotension is most likely secondary to bleeding, withdrawal of fluid,
   and increased sedation;  decreased temp most likely due to infusions
   from CVVH. Will continue to monitor temp, WBC, and LFT
s for signs of
   recurrent sepsis.
   -try to wean off of Levophed today again  w/goal to maintain MAP > 65

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure secondary to biliary obstruction and cholangitis. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, colistin, linezolid, and tigecycline. He is still dependent on vasopressor support and has not been able to wean off Levophed. The patient is also experiencing fluid overload, as indicated by his positive fluid balance and worsening edema on chest X-ray. He has received CVVH and is scheduled to advance to HD once his hemodynamics stabilize.

1. Continued dependence on vasopressor support: The patient's refractory hypotension and failure to wean off Levophed indicate a potential complication of persistent hypotension and organ perfusion issues.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance and worsening edema suggest the risk of pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise.
3. Infection: Despite receiving various antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for recurrent sepsis, especially with a likely biliary source of infection.
4. Bleeding: Although the patient's bleeding has resolved for now, there is still a risk of hemorrhage due to anticoagulation therapy and"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  5  today ); Decreased PEEP yesturday  in attempt to increase
   afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.  Increased
   RR from 12 to 16 to help blow off additional CO2 given ABG this [**6-18**]
   with academia (pH 7.26)  and CO2 44, improved today with ABG showing pH
   7.37 and CO2 32 today .
   -lighten sedation, consider attempting PSV trial tomorrow if RSBI
   improves and after more fluid removed from lungs, will re-evaluate  CXR
   to r/o RUL collapse as initial film poor quality, rotated.
   -Continue with negative balance goals via CVVH (goal is -30cc/hr); and
   advance to HD as hemodynamics and hypotension stabilize and once he is
   fully weaned off of pressors. Still showing some dependence on pressors
   and failed overnight wean, maintain on Vasopressin drip and Levophed
   now and will continue to wean slowly .
   RISD  [**6-18**] was 168 and worsening edema on CXR,  indicative of
   unfavorable extubation, will plan to calculate new RSBI later today
   once sedation weaned, currently down to 25mcg/hr  Fentanyl and mg/hr
   Versed. Extubation goal : likely re-attempt  tomorrow once off of
   sedation and BP stabilized off of pressors
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, wean failed last night. Likely evidence that there is
   lingering hypotensive effect of shock and bacteremia which must be
   further cleared with correct Abx. . Additional obstacles include the
   sedative drugs and fluid overload secondary to ESRD which are further
   complicating effort to maintain a healthy SBP and keep MAP >65.
   -try to wean off of Levophed today again  w/goal to maintain MAP > 65,
   SBP above 100
   #Septic shock
 etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved;
   intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to bleeding,
   withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation;  decreased temp most
   likely due to infusions from CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp, WBC, and LFT
s for signs of recurrent
   sepsis , serial daily blood cultures
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia
 likely biliary source given
   identification Klebsiella and enterococcus ; if deteriorates, consider
   TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl)
   -will cont. linezolid for enterococcus
   -cont. meropenem and cholistin  for klebsiella coverage,  Tigecycline
   discontinued [**6-18**]
 suspected carbapenem resistant  organism , but
   final labs to CDC pending
should be available [**Date range (1) 3823**]. Will continue
   to follow daily ID recs.
   - follow up on additional sensitivities/CDC reports that were added in
   setting of wide spread resistance.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
exploring if  a candidate for
   other line site given h/o SVC syndrome, IR contact[**Name (NI) **] today , will await
   recs /procedure plans
   - will continue femoral line for now until IR places new PICC access
   later today,  continue to monitor for si/sx of infection; clean on exam
   today, continue serial repeat blood cx monitoring for now as above
   - will arrange IR procedure under fluoroscopy for PICC placement and
   alternate access, with plan to  d/c curent femoral line.  PICC needed
   for presumed long term IV abx for bacteremia
   -appreciate ID recs; consulting/following
   #Increased bleeding
 has currently resolved; no longer bleeding from
   catheter site or femoral line site.  Improved since given  vitamin K
   and FFP, c/f DIC or hemolysis but fibrinogen WNL, no schistocytes on
   smear; per GI will need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10
   days s/p  ERCP
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily
   # ESRD
 volume status has been kept even with citrate-bath CVVH
   -will advance from CVVH to HD as soon as patient off of pressors  (CVVH
   goal -30cc/hr fluid off for now)
   -tunneled HD cath changed [**2108-6-16**] by IR
   -renally dose meds, started phosphorus supplementation and Epogen dose
   to start [**6-18**]
   .
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   #FEN  --started OG tube feeds with Nutren at 30cc/hr rate last night
   for nutrition, tolerating well,  repleting lytes PRN
   #Social
 will plan family meeting to establish care goals and

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with septic shock secondary to cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The patient's current condition includes refractory hypotension requiring vasopressor support, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and multi-organ dysfunction. He has undergone multiple interventions, including CVVH, HD, ERCP, and placement of various lines and catheters.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued hypotension and dependence on vasopressors: The patient's refractory hypotension may indicate ongoing issues with blood pressure regulation, which could lead to complications such as organ ischemia or failure.

2. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection commonly seen in ICU patients.

3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure readings suggest ongoing hemodynamic instability. This instability may increase the risk of organ damage or failure.

4. Renal complications: As the patient has ESRD, there is a risk of further"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  5  today ); Decreased PEEP yesturday  in attempt to increase
   afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.  Increased
   RR from 12 to 16 to help blow off additional CO2 given ABG this [**6-18**]
   with academia (pH 7.26)  and CO2 44, improved today with ABG showing pH
   7.37 and CO2 32 today .
   -lighten sedation, consider attempting PSV trial tomorrow if RSBI
   improves and after more fluid removed from lungs, will evaluate [**6-19**]
   a.m. CXR and continue with negative balance goals via CVVH (goal is
   -100cc/hr); and advance to HD as hemodynamics and hypotension
   stabilize. Still showing some dependence on pressors and failed
   overnight wean, still on Vasopressin drip and levophed now, will
   continue to wean.
   RISD  [**6-18**] was 168 and worsening edema on CXR,  indicative of
   unfavorable extubation, will plan to calculate new RSBI later today.
   Will con
t  wean phentanyl and versed and focus on fluid overload
   reduction today with goal extubation deferred for a day or two.
   #Septic shock
 cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction s/p
   ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved; intermittent
   hypotension is most likely secondary to bleeding, withdrawal of fluid,
   and increased sedation;  decreased temp most likely due to infusions
   from CVVH. Will continue to monitor temp, WBC, and LFT
s for signs of
   recurrent sepsis.
   -try to wean off of Levophed today again  w/goal to maintain MAP > 65
   #Polymicrobial bacteremia /ID
 likely biliary source; if
   deteriorates, consider TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl)
   -cont. linezolid for enterococcus (c/f VRE given worsening clinical
   status on vanco)
   -cont. meropenem and cholistin  for klebsiella coverage and Tigecycline
   discontinued for now
 suspected carbapenem resistant  organism , but
   final labs to CDC pending. Will continue to follow daily ID recs.
   - follow up on additional sensitivities that were added in setting of
   wide spread resistance.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
 not a candidate for other line
   site given h/o SVC syndrome
   - will continue femoral line for now; continue to monitor for si/sx of
   infection; clean on exam today, continue serial repeat blood cx
   monitoring for now
   - will evaluate for possible PICC in future (may be required for long
   term IV abx for bacteremia)
   -appreciate ID recs; consulting/following
   #Increased bleeding
 has currently resolved; no longer bleeding from
   catheter site or femoral line site.  Improved since given  vitamin K
   and FFP, c/f DIC or hemolysis but fibrinogen WNL, no schistocytes on
   smear; per GI will need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10
   days s/p  ERCP
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily
   # ESRD
 volume status has been kept even with citrate-bath CVVH
   -will advance from CVVH to HD, and wean patient off of pressors as he
   tolerates
   -tunneled HD cath changed [**2108-6-16**] by IR
   -renally dose meds, started phosphorus supplementation and Epogen dose
   to start [**6-18**]
   .
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   #FEN  --started OG tube feeds with Nutren at 30cc/hr rate last night

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary obstruction and cholangitis.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including vasopressin, norepinephrine, levophed, and multiple antibiotics. He has also undergone an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and is currently on tube feeds via an orogastric tube (OGT).

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 117/59 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute (on mechanical ventilation), oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.1°C.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.6 K/uL, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 55 K/uL, increased creatinine (Cr) of 3.0 mg/dL, low albumin level of 2.9 g/dL, and elevated lactate acid level of 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient's medical complications include septic shock, respiratory failure, increased bleeding, and possible polymicrobial bacteremia with a likely biliary source. The patient's SVC syndrome complicates venous access.

The patient's current goals include weaning off pressors, reducing fluid overload, and eventual extubation. The plan is to advance from continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) to intermittent hemodialysis (HD), continue with nutritional support, and establish care goals and longer-term disposition through a family meeting.

Potential medical complications that can arise include recurrent sepsis, endocarditis, worsening renal function, bleeding, and complications related to long-term IV antibiotic therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  5  today ); Decreased PEEP yesturday  in attempt to increase
   afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.  Increased
   RR from 12 to 16 to help blow off additional CO2 given ABG this [**6-18**]
   with academia (pH 7.26)  and CO2 44, improved today with ABG showing pH
   7.37 and CO2 32 today .
   -lighten sedation, consider attempting PSV trial tomorrow if RSBI
   improves and after more fluid removed from lungs, will re-evaluate  CXR
   to r/o RUL collapse as initial film poor quality, rotated.
   -Continue with negative balance goals via CVVH (goal is -30cc/hr); and
   advance to HD as hemodynamics and hypotension stabilize and once he is
   fully weaned off of pressors. Still showing some dependence on pressors
   and failed overnight wean, maintain on Vasopressin drip and Levophed
   now and will continue to wean slowly .
   RISD  [**6-18**] was 168 and worsening edema on CXR,  indicative of
   unfavorable extubation, will plan to calculate new RSBI later today
   once sedation weaned, currently down to 25mcg/hr  Fentanyl and mg/hr
   Versed. Extubation goal : likely re-attempt  tomorrow once off of
   sedation and BP stabilized off of pressors
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, wean failed last night. Likely evidence that there is
   lingering hypotensive effect of shock and bacteremia which must be
   further cleared with correct Abx. . Additional obstacles include the
   sedative drugs and fluid overload secondary to ESRD which are further
   complicating effort to maintain a healthy SBP and keep MAP >65.
   -try to wean off of Levophed today again  w/goal to maintain MAP > 65,
   SBP above 100
   #Septic shock
 etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved;
   intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to bleeding,
   withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation;  decreased temp most
   likely due to infusions from CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp, WBC, and LFT
s for signs of recurrent
   sepsis , serial daily blood cultures
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia
 likely biliary source given
   identification Klebsiella and enterococcus ; if deteriorates, consider
   TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl)
   -will cont. linezolid for enterococcus
   -cont. meropenem and cholistin  for klebsiella coverage,  Tigecycline
   discontinued [**6-18**]
 suspected carbapenem resistant  organism , but
   final labs to CDC pending
should be available [**Date range (1) 3823**]. Will continue
   to follow daily ID recs.
   - follow up on additional sensitivities/CDC reports that were added in
   setting of wide spread resistance.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
exploring if  a candidate for
   other line site given h/o SVC syndrome, IR contact[**Name (NI) **] today , will await
   recs /procedure plans
   - will continue femoral line for now; continue to monitor for si/sx of
   infection; clean on exam today, continue serial repeat blood cx
   monitoring for now as above
   - will also evaluate for possible PICC in future (may be required for
   long term IV abx for bacteremia)
   -appreciate ID recs; consulting/following
   #Increased bleeding
 has currently resolved; no longer bleeding from
   catheter site or femoral line site.  Improved since given  vitamin K
   and FFP, c/f DIC or hemolysis but fibrinogen WNL, no schistocytes on
   smear; per GI will need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10
   days s/p  ERCP
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily
   # ESRD
 volume status has been kept even with citrate-bath CVVH
   -will advance from CVVH to HD as soon as patient off of pressors
   -tunneled HD cath changed [**2108-6-16**] by IR
   -renally dose meds, started phosphorus supplementation and Epogen dose
   to start [**6-18**]
   .
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   #FEN  --started OG tube feeds with Nutren at 30cc/hr rate last night
   for nutrition, tolerating well,  repleting lytes PRN
   #Social
 will plan family meeting to establish care goals and
   longer-term dispo (rehab , etc..)

   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and recent biliary obstruction and cholangitis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock, respiratory failure, and multiorgan dysfunction.

Summary of Progress:

- The patient has been stable on volume-controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.
- Sedation has been lightened, and a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) is planned if the respiratory system compliance and efficiency (RSBI) improves.
- Efforts to wean the patient off pressors have been unsuccessful so far, and the patient remains dependent on vasopressin and norepinephrine.
- The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of Klebsiella and enterococcus, which are likely biliary pathogens. Meropenem and colistin have been continued for Klebsiella coverage, while linezolid has been started for enterococcus.
- The patient's SVC syndrome complicates venous access, and anticoagulation has been withheld to avoid re-clotting of biliary stents.
- The patient has been tolerating tube feeds well and is receiving nutrition through an orogastric tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He presented with septic shock and respiratory failure due to biliary obstruction and cholangitis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and sedated.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, likely due to cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction. This led to refractory hypotension and required vasopressor support.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to septic shock and mechanical ventilation. His ABG results show academia (pH 7.26) and hypercapnia (CO2 44), which have improved with appropriate ventilation settings.
3. ESRD: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis. This complicates fluid management and medication dosing.
4. SVC Syndrome: The patient's SVC syndrome complicates venous access and requires careful monitoring for thrombosis.
5. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient has a suspected polymicrobial bacteremia, likely of biliary origin, involving Klebsiella and enterococcus species. Antibiotic therapy needs to cover these organisms, including carbapenem-resistant strains.
6. Bleeding: The patient had increased bleeding, which has"

   atelectasis. Repeat CXR.
   Continues on CVVH. Metabolic acidosis persists. Electrolytes
   acceptable. Still volume overloaded from admission.
   Blood pressure improvd and intermittently off norepi. Periodically
   drops BP for unclear reasons. Concern about intermittent bacteremia.
   Sedation may be playing a role as well. Continue to wean sedations.
   Maintain vasopressin.
   Now on colistin and meropenem for gram negative bacteremia. Concern
   about femoral line. Will explore alternative access; patient has SVC
   syndrome and hx of thrombosed veins in upper body in past. Attempt to
   obtain vascuilar imaging records from [**Hospital3 961**].
   Hct stable, but now has evidence of upper GI bleed vs blood from upper

   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1426**], MD
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include hypotension, respiratory failure, renal failure, cholangitis, and metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's condition is summarized as follows: 

- The patient is still requiring vasopressin and intermittent norepinephrine, indicating persistent hypotension.
- The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and increased ventilation to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
- There is a negative fluid balance of approximately 1L for the day, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) continues.
- Sedation is being gradually reduced to assess the possibility of switching from SIMV (synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation) to PSV (pressure support ventilation).
- The patient has ongoing bacteremia despite being on meropenem, colistin, and linezolid.
- There is evidence of anemia, and the patient has upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient has SVC syndrome (superior vena cava syndrome) and a history of thrombosed veins in the upper body.
- The femoral line is a concern, and alternative access is being explored.
- The patient's Hct (hematocrit) is stable, but there is ongoing monitoring due to the upper GI bleed.
- Anti-coagulation is being held post ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's persistent bacteremia and hypotension indicate a risk for septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and mortality if not promptly addressed.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal failure, CVVH, and ongoing use of nephrotoxic medications put them at risk for AKI, which may further compromise their renal function.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and potential right upper lobe atelectasis increase the risk of developing pneumonia.

4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The evidence of upper GI bleed requires close monitoring for signs of worsening hemorrhage and potential transfusion requirements.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's SVC syndrome and history of thrombosed veins in the upper body increase their risk for DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued.

6. Multi-drug resistant infection: The patient's resistant Klebsiella infection and ongoing use of multiple antibiotics suggest a risk for developing multi-drug resistant organisms.

These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly to optimize the patient's chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan:
   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  7  today ); Increased  PEEP from 5 yesturday  in attempt to
   increase alveolar recruitment w/new RUL collapse.  Increased RR from 12
   to 16 to help blow off additional CO2  given recent  acidemic trend
   which has resolved.
   -lightened sedation, currently down to 25mcg/hr  Fentanyl and 2mg/hr
   Versed. Will consider attempting PSV trial tonight or tomorrow if can
   stabilize BP and RSBI more favorable. Will get f/up  CXR to this a.m.
   to review status RUL collapse s/p PEEP recruitment last night.
   -Given responses to boluses and improved hypotension with fluid the
   patient
s preload may be low and will adjust I/O goal to be  even today
   . Will discuss I/O goals with renal team and CVVH plan holding for now
   until left subclavian line cleared.  Will continue to try to  wean off
   of pressors as still on Vasopressin drip and continue to lower sedation
   with ultimate goal of attempt at extubation pending hypotension
   stabilizes.
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, weaned off Levophed last night but still on Vasopressin.
   Likely evidence that there is lingering hypotensive effect of shock and
   bacteremia which must be further cleared. Last 2 blood cultures
   pending, will continue current Abx regimen.  Additional obstacles
   include the sedative drugs and some evidence of pre-load dependence
   last night as BPs responded well to boluses IVF, indicating
   intravascular fluid demand despite some fluid overload, third spacing
   secondary to ESRD which are further complicating effort to maintain a
   healthy SBP > 100 and keep MAP >65.
   #Septic shock
 etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved;
   intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to bleeding,
   withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation. His initial decreased temp
   most likely due to infusions from CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp (although not fully dependable parameter
   as patient on CVVH and bear-hugger) , WBC, and LFT
s for signs of
   recurrent sepsis , serial daily blood cultures
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for septic shock and respiratory failure due to biliary obstruction and cholangitis. The patient has a polymicrobial bacteremia, likely from a biliary source, with identified organisms including Klebsiella and enterococcus. He is being treated with antibiotics, specifically meropenem and colistin for Klebsiella coverage, as well as linezolid for enterococcus.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has refractory hypotension that has not improved despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. This may be due to lingering effects of shock, bacteremia, and third spacing secondary to ESRD.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on volume-controlled ventilation with increased PEEP to improve alveolar recruitment. There is a concern for increased CO2 retention, which has been addressed by increasing the respiratory rate.
3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction. Despite initial improvement, there is a concern for recurrent sepsis, and daily blood cultures are being monitored.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has a polymicrobial bacteremia"

   Assessment and Plan:
   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  7  today ); Increased  PEEP from 5 yesturday  in attempt to
   increase alveolar recruitment w/new RUL collapse.  Increased RR from 12
   to 16 to help blow off additional CO2  given recent  acidemic trend
   which has resolved.
   -lightened sedation, currently down to 25mcg/hr  Fentanyl and 2mg/hr
   Versed. Will consider attempting PSV trial tonight or tomorrow if can
   stabilize BP and RSBI more favorable. Will get f/up  CXR to this a.m.
   to review status RUL collapse s/p PEEP recruitment last night.
   -Given responses to boluses and improved hypotension with fluid the
   patient
s preload may be low and will adjust I/O goal to be  even today
   . Will discuss I/O goals with renal team and CVVH plan holding for now
   until left subclavian line cleared.  Will continue to try to  wean off
   of pressors as still on Vasopressin drip and continue to lower sedation
   with ultimate goal of attempt at extubation pending hypotension
   stabilizes.
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, weaned off Levophed last night but still on Vasopressin.
   Likely evidence that there is lingering hypotensive effect of shock and
   bacteremia which must be further cleared. Last 2 blood cultures
   pending, will continue current Abx regimen.  Additional obstacles
   include the sedative drugs and some evidence of pre-load dependence
   last night as BPs responded well to boluses IVF, indicating
   intravascular fluid demand despite some fluid overload, third spacing
   secondary to ESRD which are further complicating effort to maintain a
   healthy SBP > 100 and keep MAP >65.
   #Septic shock
 etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved;
   intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to bleeding,
   withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation. His initial decreased temp
   most likely due to infusions from CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp (although not fully dependable parameter
   as patient on CVVH and bear-hugger) , WBC, and LFT
s for signs of
   recurrent sepsis , serial daily blood cultures
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia

The patient has been experiencing refractory hypotension and requires vasopressor support. 

The patient's respiratory status has been stable on volume control ventilation with increased PEEP from 5 to 7 in an attempt to increase alveolar recruitment. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 200, indicating moderate hypoxemia. 

The patient has a polymicrobial bacteremia likely from a biliary source, with identified Klebsiella and enterococcus species. The patient is currently receiving meropenem and colistin for Klebsiella coverage, as well as linezolid for enterococcus. 

The patient's bleeding has resolved, but there is a concern for increased bleeding due to DIC or hemolysis, which may require vitamin K and FFP. The patient's coagulation parameters are being monitored daily, and a type and screen have been renewed.

The patient has hypothyroidism and is receiving daily levothyroxine. The patient's volume status is being closely monitored, and CVVH is currently clogged at the left subclavian site. 

The patient's SVC syndrome complicates venous access, and anticoagulation is being withheld due to coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting biliary stents. 

The patient requires new arterial and venous access due to complications with existing lines. 

The patient is currently on comfort care measures with a DNR/DNI status and will have a family meeting to discuss long-term disposition and possible comfort care options."

   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  7  today ); Decreased PEEP yesturday  in attempt to increase
   afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.  Increased
   RR from 12 to 16 to help blow off additional CO2  given recent
   acidemic trend which has resolved.
   -lightened sedation, currently down to 25mcg/hr  Fentanyl and 2mg/hr
   Versed. Will consider attempting PSV trial tonight or tomorrow if can
   stabilize BP and RSBI more favorable. Will get f/up  CXR to this a.m.
   to review status RUL collapse s/p PEEP recruitment last night.
   -Given responses to boluses and improved hypotension with fluid the
   patient
s preload may be low and will adjust I/O goal to be closer to
   even today, slightly negative even to -200-300cc . Will continue with
   CVVH (goal is -30cc/hr); and advance to HD as hemodynamics and
   hypotension stabilize and once he is fully weaned off of pressors as
   still on Vasopressin drip. Will discuss I/O goals with renal team.
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, weaned off Levophed last night but still on Vasopressin.
   Likely evidence that there is lingering hypotensive effect of shock and
   bacteremia which must be further cleared with correct Abx. . Additional
   obstacles include the sedative drugs and fluid overload secondary to
   ESRD which are further complicating effort to maintain a healthy SBP >
   100 and keep MAP >65.
   #Septic shock
 etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved;
   intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to bleeding,
   withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation;  decreased temp most
   likely due to infusions from CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp (although not fully dependable parameter
   as patient on CVVH and bear-hugger) , WBC, and LFT
s for signs of
   recurrent sepsis , serial daily blood cultures
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia
 likely biliary source given
   identification Klebsiella and enterococcus ; if deteriorates, consider
   TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl) -will cont. linezolid for enterococcus
   -cont. meropenem and cholistin  for klebsiella coverage,  Tigecycline
   discontinued [**6-18**]
 suspected carbapenem resistant  organism , but
   final labs to CDC pending
should be available [**Date range (1) 3823**]. Will continue
   to follow daily ID recs.
   - follow up on additional sensitivities/CDC reports that were added in
   setting of wide spread resistance.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
exploring if  a candidate for
   other line site given h/o SVC syndrome, IR contact[**Name (NI) **] today , will await
   recs /procedure plans
   - will continue femoral line for now and switch in new line today,  IR
   placed new PICC access to mid-line in left arm yesturday,  continue to
   monitor for si/sx of infection; clean on exam today, continue serial
   repeat blood cx monitoring for now as above. Needs new a-line placed in
   left arm today as well.
   -  PICC will be needed for presumed long term IV abx for bacteremia
   -appreciate ID recs; consulting/following
   #Increased bleeding
 has currently resolved; no longer bleeding from
   catheter site or femoral line site.  Improved since given  vitamin K
   and FFP, c/f DIC or hemolysis but fibrinogen WNL, no schistocytes on
   smear; per GI will need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10
   days s/p  ERCP
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily, type and screen renewed [**6-19**]
   #Endocrine
 continue daily levothyroxine for hypotyroidism, PO to IV
   dose switched from 100 to 50mcg daily
   # ESRD
 volume status has been kept even with citrate-bath CVVH
   -will advance from CVVH to HD as soon as patient off of pressors  (CVVH
   goal -30cc/hr fluid off for now)
   -tunneled HD cath changed [**2108-6-16**] by IR, lines being re-evaluted today
   by IR
   -renally dose meds, continue phosphorus supplementation and Epogen
   .
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   -plan to re-start Coumadin on [**6-25**]
   #Access  - Right femoral needs replacement , Left Subclavian line in
   place, IR placed new Left arm PICC that goes mid-line, left a-line
   pulled last night, needs replacement today

- The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome associated with septic shock and respiratory failure.
- The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [**6-15**] due to biliary obstruction and cholangitis.
- The patient's current condition includes refractory hypotension, likely due to lingering effects of shock and bacteremia.
- The patient is dependent on vasopressor support, including Vasopressin, and has required multiple fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved with volume control ventilation and decreased PEEP.
- The patient has a polymicrobial bacteremia, likely originating from the biliary tract, with identification of Klebsiella and enterococcus species.
- The patient's increased bleeding has resolved, but there are ongoing concerns about coagulopathy and the need for anticoagulation.
- The patient's endocrine status includes hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine.
- The patient's ESRD is being managed with CVVH and HD, with plans to advance from CVVH to HD once the patient is off pressors.

   patient
s preload may be low and will adjust I/O goal to be closer to
   even today, slightly negative even to -200-300cc . Will continue with
   CVVH (goal is -30cc/hr); and advance to HD as hemodynamics and
   hypotension stabilize and once he is fully weaned off of pressors as
   still on Vasopressin drip. Will discuss I/O goals with renal team.
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, weaned off Levophed last night but still on Vasopressin.
   Likely evidence that there is lingering hypotensive effect of shock and
   bacteremia which must be further cleared with correct Abx. . Additional
   obstacles include the sedative drugs and fluid overload secondary to
   ESRD which are further complicating effort to maintain a healthy SBP >
   100 and keep MAP >65.
   #Septic shock
 etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved;
   intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to bleeding,
   withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation;  decreased temp most
   likely due to infusions from CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp (although not fully dependable parameter
   as patient on CVVH and bear-hugger) , WBC, and LFT
s for signs of
   recurrent sepsis , serial daily blood cultures
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia
 likely biliary source given
   identification Klebsiella and enterococcus ; if deteriorates, consider
   TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl) -will cont. linezolid for enterococcus
   -cont. meropenem and cholistin  for klebsiella coverage,  Tigecycline
   discontinued [**6-18**]
 suspected carbapenem resistant  organism , but
   final labs to CDC pending
should be available [**Date range (1) 3823**]. Will continue
   to follow daily ID recs.
   - follow up on additional sensitivities/CDC reports that were added in
   setting of wide spread resistance.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
exploring if  a candidate for
   other line site given h/o SVC syndrome, IR contact[**Name (NI) **] today , will await
   recs /procedure plans
   - will continue femoral line for now and switch in new line today,  IR
   placed new PICC access to mid-line in left arm yesturday,  continue to
   monitor for si/sx of infection; clean on exam today, continue serial
   repeat blood cx monitoring for now as above. Needs new a-line placed in
   left arm today as well.
   -  PICC will be needed for presumed long term IV abx for bacteremia
   -appreciate ID recs; consulting/following
   #Increased bleeding
 has currently resolved; no longer bleeding from
   catheter site or femoral line site.  Improved since given  vitamin K
   and FFP, c/f DIC or hemolysis but fibrinogen WNL, no schistocytes on
   smear; per GI will need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10
   days s/p  ERCP
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily, type and screen renewed [**6-19**]
   #Endocrine
 continue daily levothyroxine for hypotyroidism, PO to IV
   dose switched from 100 to 50mcg daily
   # ESRD
 volume status has been kept even with citrate-bath CVVH
   -will advance from CVVH to HD as soon as patient off of pressors  (CVVH
   goal -30cc/hr fluid off for now)
   -tunneled HD cath changed [**2108-6-16**] by IR, lines being re-evaluted today
   by IR
   -renally dose meds, continue phosphorus supplementation and Epogen
   .
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   -plan to re-start Coumadin on [**6-25**]
   #Access  - Right femoral needs replacement , Left Subclavian line in
   place, IR placed new Left arm PICC that goes mid-line, left a-line
   pulled last night, needs replacement today

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-inch tall individual with a current weight of 88.8 kg and an admission weight of 89.8 kg. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
- Heart rate: 69 bpm (with a range of 57-90 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 100/49 mmHg (with a range of 67-164/43-74 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 0-16 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 7 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 21 cmH2O, and plateau pressure at 20 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, HCO3- of 80 mEq/L, SaO2 of 99%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,049 mL (including 729 mL through enteral feeding and 3,658 mL through intravenous fluids) and a total output of 3,106 mL (including 392 mL through enteral output and 2,714 mL through urinary output). The patient's weight has remained relatively stable since admission.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), blood glucose, and most other electrolytes. However, there is an elevated level of lactate (1.0 mmol/L), D-dimer (2642 ng/mL), and lactic acid (1.0 mmol/L).

The patient's care plan includes ICU care, nutrition support with Nutren 2.0 at 30 mL/hour, glycemic control, and various lines such as a multi-lumen line, arterial line, dialysis catheter, and midline. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient appears to be stable with controlled vital signs and respiratory support. However, the elevated lactate level and D-dimer suggest possible complications such as sepsis or thrombo"

   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  5  today ); Decreased PEEP yesturday  in attempt to increase
   afterload and reduce dependence on pressors to maintain bp.  Increased
   RR from 12 to 16 to help blow off additional CO2 given ABG this [**6-18**]
   with academia (pH 7.26)  and CO2 44, improved today with ABG showing pH
   7.37 and CO2 32 today .
   -lighten sedation, consider attempting PSV trial tomorrow if RSBI
   improves and after more fluid removed from lungs, will re-evaluate  CXR
   to r/o RUL collapse as initial film poor quality, rotated.
   -Continue with negative balance goals via CVVH (goal is -30cc/hr); and
   advance to HD as hemodynamics and hypotension stabilize and once he is
   fully weaned off of pressors. Still showing some dependence on pressors
   and failed overnight wean, maintain on Vasopressin drip and Levophed
   now and will continue to wean slowly .
   RISD  [**6-18**] was 168 and worsening edema on CXR,  indicative of
   unfavorable extubation, will plan to calculate new RSBI later today
   once sedation weaned, currently down to 25mcg/hr  Fentanyl and mg/hr
   Versed. Extubation goal : likely re-attempt  tomorrow once off of
   sedation and BP stabilized off of pressors
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, wean failed last night. Likely evidence that there is
   lingering hypotensive effect of shock and bacteremia which must be
   further cleared with correct Abx. . Additional obstacles include the
   sedative drugs and fluid overload secondary to ESRD which are further
   complicating effort to maintain a healthy SBP and keep MAP >65.
   -try to wean off of Levophed today again  w/goal to maintain MAP > 65,
   SBP above 100
   #Septic shock
 etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); appears to have resolved;
   intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to bleeding,
   withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation;  decreased temp most
   likely due to infusions from CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with septic shock and respiratory failure secondary to cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction following an ERCP. The patient has been critically ill with refractory hypotension, requiring vasopressors, and dependent on mechanical ventilation. He also has SVC syndrome and is experiencing complications related to multiple lines and access issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for continued respiratory failure due to underlying lung collapse and fluid overload.
2. Hypotension: The patient has refractory hypotension, which may be due to lingering effects of shock and ongoing bacteremia. This poses a risk for inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Sepsis: The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia, likely originating from the biliary tract. There is a risk of recurrent sepsis, and daily blood cultures are being monitored.
4. Endotracheal Tuberculosis: Due to prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. SVC Syndrome: The patient's SVC syndrome complicates venous access, making it difficult to place new lines. This increases the risk of complications related to central venous catheterization.
6. Kidney Injury: As the patient has ESR"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome secondary to Coumadin use. The patient presented with septic shock due to cholangitis in the setting of biliary obstruction post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). He also has polymicrobial bacteremia likely from a biliary source, with Klebsiella and enterococcus identified. The patient is currently intubated and on volume-controlled ventilation with decreased PEEP to increase afterload and reduce dependence on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 100/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's general appearance is sedated, obese, intubated, with a large tongue noted, and an orogastric tube in place.

Physical examination reveals decreased lung sounds bilaterally at bases (right greater than left), no wheeze, and posterior exam deferred. Cardiac examination shows S1/S2 appreciated, jugular venous pressure (JVP) unable to assess due to squat neck/body habitus, no murmurs or rubs identified. Abdominal examination is obese,"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Respiratory failure
   2) Chronic renal failure
   3) Gram negative bacteremia
   4) Cholangitis
   5) Anemia
   6) Thrombocytopenia
   RUL atelectasis improved with chest PT and increased PEEP. Oxygenation
   adequate on FIO2=0.4. Maintain PEEP at 7 for today.
   Hypotension improved with fluids overnight. Continues on vasopressin.
   It remains difficult to assess central filling pressures; patient is
   still total body volume overloaded but acting in a pre-load dependent
   manner, perhaps due to low SVR from ongoing sepsis. Will keep fluids
   even to slightly negative today.
   Increasing difficulty removing fluid via CVVH due to access pressure;
   concern about thrombosis of dialysis catheter. Patient had bleeding
   issues earlier in the admission when he was coagulopathic. Risk of
   using thrombolytic in the presence of thrombocytopenia. Given severe
   general access issues, I would favor trying a thrombolytic in the line.
   Dose of colistin increased. Most recent blood cultures negative to
   date. WBC down. Will need
   Hct at 25. No obvious bleeding now. No need for transfusion now.
   Platelet count down slightly.
   Patient's likelihood of surviving this is low (sepsis for one week and
   significant co-morbidities). Will have family meeting today.

   Total time spent: 50 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old overweight male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, hypotension, gram-negative bacteremia, and cholangitis. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has been receiving multiple infusions including vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, and calcium gluconate (CRRT). The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 118/57 mmHg and a heart rate of 69 bpm. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 7 cmH2O. The patient's blood cultures have been negative, and the white blood cell count is decreasing. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia. Imaging shows improved aeration in the right upper lobe with probable atelectasis or effusions at the bases bilaterally.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the patient's condition worsens or if there are complications with the ventilator, respiratory failure could lead to further respiratory distress or even respiratory arrest.

2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which increases the risk of fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances. Complications such as hypertension, edema, and anemia may occur"

   patient comfortable on A/C vent as BP stabilizes. Will get f/up CXR to
   this a.m. to review status RUL collapse earlier in wk.
   -Given responses to boluses and improved hypotension with fluid the
   patient
s preload may be low and will continue to keep an even I/O goal
   today . Will discuss family
s wishes for comfort care with renal team
   and convey that they wish to withdraw CVVH/HD efforts
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, weaned off Levophed but still remains on  Vasopressin drip
   and requiring IVF boluses daily to maintain BPs . There is likely some
   lingering hypotensive effect of sepsis given highly resistant
   bacteremia which must be further cleared. Last 2 blood cultures
   pending, will continue current Abx regimen.  Patient also has some
   extravascular fluid overload, third spacing secondary to ESRD which are
   further complicating effort to maintain a healthy SBP. Goal SBP > 100
   and keep MAP >65 for now.
   #Septic shock
 Etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); acute phase appears to have
   resolved; intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to
   bleeding, withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation. His initial
   decreased temp most likely due to infusions from CVVH. Tmax 98.4 now
   off of CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp , WBC, and LFT
s for signs of recurrent
   sepsis  pending decision for CMO
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia
 likely biliary source given
   identification Klebsiella and enterococcus ; if deteriorates, consider
   TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl) -will cont. linezolid for enterococcus
   -cont. meropenem and colistin  for klebsiella coverage,  suspected
   carbapenem resistant  organism , but final lab results w/ CDC pending.
   Will continue to follow daily ID recs, and communicate new shift toward
   comfort care goals.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
exploring if  a candidate for
   other line site given h/o SVC syndrome, IR contact[**Name (NI) **] today , will await
   recs /procedure plans
   - will continue femoral line for now and hold off  switching new lines
   until discuss with family later.   IR placed new midline access  in
   left arm yesturday,  continue to monitor for si/sx of infection; clean
   on exam today, continue serial repeat blood cx monitoring for now as
   above.
   -  Mid-line at left arm may be needed for presumed long term IV abx for
   bacteremia
   #Increased bleeding
 small amount of ETT blood last night (20cc) ; no
   longer bleeding, no bleeding from catheter sites or femoral line site.
   Will consider  vitamin K and FFP if rebleeds. Per GI, patient  will
   need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10 days s/p  ERCP
   which was [**6-15**]
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily, type and screen renewed [**6-19**]
   (pending comfort care decision, otherwise will stop transfusions)
   #Endocrine
 continue daily levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, PO to IV
   dose switched from 100 to 50mcg daily
   # ESRD
 discontinuing  CVVH /HD ,  renally dose meds, continue
   phosphorus supplementation and Epogen
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   -plan to re-start Coumadin on [**6-25**]. Given new question of left
   subclavian line clot will discuss additional tPA , likely not needed
   anymore given care goal shift to d/c dialysis
   #Access  - Right femoral , Left Subclavian line in place, IR placed new
   Left arm mid-line
   #FEN  --started OG tube feeds with Nutren at 30cc/hr rate on [**6-18**]  for

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome on coumadin, septic shock, respiratory failure, and biliary obstruction with cholangitis. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient has a suspected polymicrobial bacteremia, likely of biliary origin. There is a risk of recurrent sepsis and potential progression to septic shock.
3. Biliary Obstruction/Cholangitis: The patient has biliary obstruction with ongoing cholangitis, which can lead to further complications such as worsening liver function and systemic infection.
4. SVC Syndrome: The patient has SVC syndrome, which complicates venous access. There is a risk of re-clotting of biliary stents and potential complications related to central venous catheters.
5. Hypotension: The patient has refractory hypotension requiring vasopressor support. There is a concern for persistent hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.
6. Increased Bleeding: The patient had a small amount of blood from the endotrache"

","Summary:
The patient is a sedated, intubated, and obese individual in the ICU with a complex medical history. They have been experiencing low blood pressure, requiring IV fluids and vasopressin infusions. There are concerns about a possible blood clot, with attempts to flush both lines but neither able to be aspirated. The patient had a small amount of red blood at the endotracheal tube last night. The sister of the patient has requested to stop CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) attempts and does not want any further dialysis. A family meeting was held yesterday to discuss ultimate comfort care, and the decision will be followed up on today. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 80s, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially result in organ damage.
2. Possible Blood Clot: The suspicion of a clot, with both lines unable to be aspirated, raises concerns for a potential pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. This can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
3. Bleeding: The small amount of red blood at the endotracheal tube suggests possible bleeding, which could be due to coagulopathy or trauma during intubation.
4. Withdrawal from sedation: The patient's sedation level is mentioned as mild withdrawal to painful"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 80s, requiring IV fluids to sustain it. The patient also has a suspected clot, for which tPA flushes were given through the HD catheter. However, both lines could not be aspirated.

The patient's family meeting yesterday resulted in a decision to stop CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) attempts and focus on ultimate comfort care. As a result, replacement femoral and a-lines were not placed.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received antibiotics including meropenem, colistin, and linezolid.

The patient is currently on several infusions such as midazolam (Versed), vasopressin, and fentanyl. They are also receiving pantoprazole (Protonix).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 95/53 to 87/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's weight is currently 95.2 kg, with a total fluid intake of 3,898 mL, including 670 mL through the NG tube, 722 mL through TF, and 3,116 mL through IVF. The total output includes 1,138 mL of blood products and 0 mL of urine output.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set Vt of 450 mL, RR set at 16, PEEP at 7 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and SpO2 of 99%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.6, PCO2 of 19 mmHg, PO2 of 118 mg/dL, and HCO3- of 28 mg/dL.

The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 51 K/uL, creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, total CO2 of 22 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 118 mg/dL to 173 mg/dL, and other lab results indicating potential kidney dysfunction and metabolic disturbances.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is mentioned as unknown."

   Assessment and Plan:
   48 y/o M h/o Down syndrome, ESRD on HD, SVC syndrome on coumadin a/w
   septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary
   obstruction and cholangitis.
   # Resp failure -  Stable on volume control ventilation (450cc x 12 bpm
   on PEEP  7  today ); Increased  PEEP from 5 earlier in the week  in an
   attempt to increase alveolar recruitment given new RUL collapse.
   -lightened sedation, but patient appeared uncomfortable so increased to
   75mcg/hr  Fentanyl and 3mg/hr Versed. At this juncture will keep
   patient comfortable on A/C vent as BP stabilizes. Will get f/up CXR to
   this a.m. to review status RUL collapse earlier in wk.
   -Given responses to boluses and improved hypotension with fluid the
   patient
s preload may be low and will continue to keep an even I/O goal
   today . Will discuss family
s wishes for comfort care with renal team
   and convey that they wish to withdraw CVVH/HD efforts
   #Hypotension- has been refractory issue as patient been dependent on
   pressors, weaned off Levophed but still remains on  Vasopressin drip
   and requiring IVF boluses daily to maintain BPs . There is likely some
   lingering hypotensive effect of sepsis given highly resistant
   bacteremia which must be further cleared. Last 2 blood cultures
   pending, will continue current Abx regimen.  Patient also has some
   extravascular fluid overload, third spacing secondary to ESRD which are
   further complicating effort to maintain a healthy SBP. Goal SBP > 100
   and keep MAP >65 for now.
   #Septic shock
 Etiology is cholangitis in the setting of biliary
   obstruction s/p ERCP [**6-15**] (and [**6-13**]); acute phase appears to have
   resolved; intermittent hypotension was initially attributed to
   bleeding, withdrawal of fluid, and increased sedation. His initial
   decreased temp most likely due to infusions from CVVH. Tmax 98.4 now
   off of CVVH.
   -Will continue to monitor temp , WBC, and LFT
s for signs of recurrent
   sepsis , serial daily blood cultures
   #ID/ Polymicrobial bacteremia
 likely biliary source given
   identification Klebsiella and enterococcus ; if deteriorates, consider
   TEE to r/o endocarditis (TTE nl) -will cont. linezolid for enterococcus
   -cont. meropenem and colistin  for klebsiella coverage,  suspected
   carbapenem resistant  organism , but final lab results w/ CDC pending.
   Will continue to follow daily ID recs, and communicate new shift toward
   comfort care goals.
   -tunnel HD line changed [**2108-6-16**] @ IR
exploring if  a candidate for
   other line site given h/o SVC syndrome, IR contact[**Name (NI) **] today , will await
   recs /procedure plans
   - will continue femoral line for now and hold off  switching new lines
   until discuss with family later.   IR placed new midline access  in
   left arm yesturday,  continue to monitor for si/sx of infection; clean
   on exam today, continue serial repeat blood cx monitoring for now as
   above.
   -  Mid-line at left arm may be needed for presumed long term IV abx for
   bacteremia
   #Increased bleeding
 small amount of ETT blood last night (20cc) ; no
   longer bleeding, no bleeding from catheter sites or femoral line site.
   Will consider  vitamin K and FFP if rebleeds. Per GI, patient  will
   need to be off anticoagulation with Coumadin for 10 days s/p  ERCP
   which was [**6-15**]
   -Will continue to use parameters to transfuse if  Hct < 24%,  plts <
   10K,  following  CBC, coags daily, type and screen renewed [**6-19**]
   (pending comfort care decision, otherwise will stop transfusions)
   #Endocrine
 continue daily levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, PO to IV
   dose switched from 100 to 50mcg daily
   # ESRD
 discontinuing  CVVH /HD ,  renally dose meds, continue
   phosphorus supplementation and Epogen
   #SVC syndrome
 complicates venous access
   -withholding anticoagulation given coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting
   biliary stents (x10 days s/p ERCP on [**6-15**])
   -plan to re-start Coumadin on [**6-25**]. Given new question of left
   subclavian line clot will discuss additional tPA , likely not needed
   anymore given care goal shift to d/c dialysis
   #Access  - Right femoral , Left Subclavian line in place, IR placed new
   Left arm mid-line
   #FEN  --started OG tube feeds with Nutren at 30cc/hr rate on [**6-18**]  for
   nutrition, tolerating well, will continue, and plan to  replete lytes
   PRN
   #Social
 will plan family meeting today to establish care goals, code
   status DNR now , will discuss long term disposition given multiple
   failing organs, will review possible comfort care decisions with
   family.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome on coumadin associated with septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of biliary obstruction and cholangitis. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, requiring vasopressor support, and has had intermittent hypotension attributed to bleeding, fluid withdrawal, and increased sedation. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, and there are concerns about recurrent sepsis. There is also a possibility of endocarditis. The patient has a polymicrobial bacteremia, likely from a biliary source, with identification of Klebsiella and enterococcus. There is suspected carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella organism. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and colistin. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and serial daily blood cultures will be continued. The patient has a history of SVC syndrome, which complicates venous access, and anticoagulation has been withheld due to coagulopathy and risk of re-clotting biliary stents. The patient's ESRD requires discontinuation of CVVH/HD and renally dosed medications. The patient's nutritional status is being addressed through enteral feeding. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is pending a family meeting to establish care goals. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent sepsis: The patient's temperature fluctuations and previous episodes of hypotension may indicate ongoing or recurrent sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's polymicrobial bacteremia and presence of enterococcus, there is a concern for endocarditis, especially in the setting of intravascular catheters.
3. Bleeding: The patient had a small amount of blood in the endotracheal tube last night, indicating a potential bleeding risk. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be considered if rebleeding occurs.
4. Thrombosis: The patient has a new question of left subclavian line clot, which may require additional tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).
5. SVC syndrome exacerbation: The patient's SVC syndrome complicates venous access, and there is a risk of worsening symptoms if anticoagulation is resumed.
6. Kidney injury: Discontinuation of CVVH/HD may lead to worsening renal function or kidney injury.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's ability to tolerate enteral feeding should be monitored, and nutrition support may need to be adjusted if there are issues with tolerance or absorption.
8. Cardiovascular collapse: The patient's hypotension and dependence on vasopressors indicate a high risk of cardiovascular collapse if adequate blood pressure and perfusion are not maintained.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is an inability to maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation.

Please note that the potential medical complications listed above are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and Down syndrome. He presented with cholangitis and bacteremia, likely due to a line infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and likely carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella. The patient has been experiencing persistent sepsis and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing persistent sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and potentially be life-threatening.
2. Multi-drug resistant infections: The presence of VRE and likely carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella increases the risk of treatment challenges and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, indicating a compromised renal function. This increases the risk of further deterioration in kidney function and may require dialysis support.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure or severe respiratory compromise.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential cardiovascular instability, which may require vasopressor support.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, suggesting a risk of malnutrition due to prolonged enteral support.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
8. Stress ulcers: The patient is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), Down syndrome, and recurrent line infections. He presented with cholangitis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and likely carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella, leading to sepsis. The patient's prognosis for recovery is very poor, especially considering his baseline condition and lack of long-term access for hemodialysis.

The patient's family has decided to move towards comfort measures only, discontinuing additional invasive procedures or toxic medications. The patient is currently receiving ventilator support, antibiotics, vasopressin, and intermittent fluid boluses. The endotracheal tube (ETT) was removed, and the patient is now on comfort measures.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of the endotracheal tube and potential aspiration.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins, which could lead to potentially life-threatening complications if they travel to the lungs.

3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and the use of vasopressor medications can increase gastric acid secretion, leading to the development of stress ulcers in"
