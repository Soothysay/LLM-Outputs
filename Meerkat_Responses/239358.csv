","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with schizophrenia and pneumonia, currently admitted to the ICU. She has been experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and intermittent fevers. Her respiratory status is stable with the use of a nasal cannula, but she has wheezing in the left lower lobe and rhonchi diffusely. The patient has a history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in her urine, but recent cultures have shown pan-sensitivity. She is currently receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for her pneumonia. The patient also has a history of schizophrenia and is being treated with antipsychotics. She is unable to stand or walk, and her neurologic examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 134 bpm, blood pressure of 85/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,315 mL and output of 2,303 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,995 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's condition is critical."

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and is currently receiving various medications including cefepime, metoprolol, digoxin, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are unstable with a heart rate ranging from 118 to 130 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 92/42 to 111/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, and troponin T, along with low levels of hemoglobin and albumin. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, altered nutrition, urinary tract infection, psychiatric disease, atrial fibrillation, and risk for aspiration. The patient's airway is at risk due to altered gag reflex and airway clearance, and the patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is transfer to the floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, was admitted with healthcare-associated lower left lobe pneumonia. On admission, she showed signs of respiratory distress and required supplemental oxygen. She also presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggestive of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin, due to her history of resistant gram-negative organisms. Intravenous fluid boluses were given as needed.

The patient had episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which responded to IV metoprolol but continued intermittently. Digoxin was started, and attempts were made to restart low-dose metoprolol.

A urine culture revealed a significant growth of gram-negative rods, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotic coverage was continued as per previous orders.

The patient experienced difficulty swallowing both pills and food, leading to the decision to keep her NPO pending a swallow evaluation.

Other medical conditions mentioned include hypertension, lower extremity edema, and schizophrenia. The patient is being managed with appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, line care, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and elevation of the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted with healthcare-associated left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's respiratory function was stable on admission but has been experiencing occasional desaturation requiring face tent. She has borderline hypotension, fever, and tachycardia consistent with SIRS/sepsis. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, cefepime, levo), IV fluid boluses as needed, oxygen via nasal cannula, and close monitoring of blood pressure.

The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which responded to IV metoprolol but has been in and out of AFib since arrival to the floor. She dropped her blood pressure after receiving low-dose metoprolol. It is likely that the acute infection on admission exacerbated her AFib. She has been started on digoxin and will continue taking ASA 325. The attempt to restart low-dose metoprolol this morning will be made.

The patient has a urinary tract infection, as indicated by the presence of >100k GNR in her urine culture. Antibiotics have been continued as per above.

The patient also has dysphagia, as she had difficulty swallowing pills and food yesterday. She is currently NPO and awaiting a swallow evaluation.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 5683] is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted with healthcare-associated left lower lobe pneumonia. She has shown borderline hypotension, fever, and tachycardia consistent with SIRS/sepsis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) - The patient has a large left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and worsening oxygenation.
2. Sepsis - The patient's symptoms of hypotension, fever, and tachycardia are suggestive of sepsis. If not promptly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock, which is life-threatening.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI) - The presence of >100k GNR in the urine culture indicates a UTI. If left untreated, it can lead to the progression of infection and potentially cause systemic symptoms.
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - The patient's episodes of atrial fibrillation may worsen due to acute infection or underlying cardiac issues. This can result in an irregular heart rhythm, potentially leading to complications like blood clots or stroke.
5. Hypotension - The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring, as it may indicate inadequate organ perfusion and can lead to organ dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted with healthcare-associated left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension consistent with sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). She has been experiencing difficulty swallowing, leading to a decision to keep her nil per os (NPO) and change her antibiotics to intravenous (IV) administration. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure in the 80s systolic, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has a history of resistant gram-negative organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP): The patient initially presented with large left lower lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating a bacterial infection. This condition requires aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care to prevent further complications such as respiratory failure or septic shock.
2. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Immediate management includes prompt administration of broad-spectrum"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. She has been admitted to the ICU and is critically ill. The patient appears to have difficulty swallowing and coughing with oral intake. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation, and her vital signs include a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/55 to 111/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient has received various medications, including heparin, ASA, perphenazine, divalproate, and cefepime. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and glucose of 83 mg/dL. The patient's urine output has been low, with only 595 mL in the past 24 hours. She is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula, and her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.6. The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, muscle wasting, and cool skin. She is alert and attentive but unable to move or assess her tone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's difficulty swallowing and coughing with oral intake, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia"

   LLL pneumonia initially w/ septic picture, now improved.   Paroxysmal
   Afib w/ RVR remains intermittent issue.  Stable overnight. Concern over
   aspiration food/meds.  Has UTI which is covered by her broad spectrum
   abx for pneumonia.  Concern over aspiration food/meds so NPO pending

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with healthcare-associated lower lobe pneumonia. Upon admission, she had borderline hypotension, fever, and tachycardia, which were consistent with sepsis. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Her respiratory function was initially stable but required oxygen supplementation occasionally. She has been experiencing occasional desaturation events and requires face tent support.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Her laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.5 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 93 thousand/mm3. She also has elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) at 112 mg/L and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 223 IU/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions such as alteration in nutrition, hypotension, urinary tract infection, psychiatric disease, atrial fibrillation, and risk for aspiration. She is currently being treated with various medications including depakote"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 5683], an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, was admitted to the ICU with healthcare-associated lower lobe pneumonia. On admission, she exhibited signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. She was initially placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin, due to her history of resistant gram-negative organisms. The patient's respiratory function has been stable, but she has experienced occasional desaturation requiring supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Her blood pressure has been borderline hypotensive, and she has had a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. She is currently receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) as needed and continuing with oxygen therapy. A sputum culture has been sent for analysis, and the results of the Legionella test are negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alteration in nutrition: The patient is at risk for malnutrition due to her inability to protect her airway and potential aspiration.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, indicating hypotension. She is being closely monitored, and IVF boluses are given as needed.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture revealed a significant growth of gram-negative rods, indicating a UTI. Antibiotic treatment has been continued based on previous"

","The patient's medical history includes hypotension, urinary tract infection (UTI), psychiatric disease (including schizophrenia and personality disorders), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and risk for aspiration. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been started on various medications, including cefipime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The vital signs show a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and potassium (K+), as well as low levels of hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), and albumin. The white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range, but there is an increase in troponin-T level.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment in several areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and respiratory systems.

The patient's plan includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and monitoring of lines and prophylaxis measures. The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypotension, progression of UTI, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, development of further cardiac arrhythm"
