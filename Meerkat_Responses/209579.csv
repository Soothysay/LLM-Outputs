","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV, and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented with acute onset abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum. The patient is currently undergoing chemoembolization in the interventional radiology (IR) department. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal pain: The patient's CT abdomen showed hemoperitoneum, which is concerning for hemorrhage from a HCC metastasis, likely the source of abdominal pain. The patient is currently receiving chemoembolization in the IR department. There is also a possibility of a bowel source of abdominal pain, most concerning would be an embolic or ischemic event. The patient denies blood in stool, melena, or bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR). The final read of the CT abdomen is pending.

- 2 large bore IVs
- Pain control
- Follow-up final CT abdomen/pelvis read

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with HIV and Hep C, who has been admitted to the ICU for a ruptured HCC lesion leading to hemoperitoneum. He underwent chemoembolization in the interventional radiology (IR) department. The patient is currently experiencing severe pain, and the source of abdominal pain is suspected to be either the HCC metastasis or a possible bowel issue. The patient denies having any signs of bleeding, such as blood in the urine or stool. His vital signs are stable, but he is showing signs of leukocytosis, which could be a stress reaction or an infection. The patient's blood work shows low platelet count and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's HIV treatment has been held due to his acute illness and the risk of pancytopenia/anemia. The patient's HCV treatment is ongoing, and his liver synthetic function appears preserved. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, but it does not seem to be causing significant problems at this time. The patient has chosen to be on do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status. The patient will remain in the ICU until his hematocrit stabilizes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage: The patient already has hemoperitoneum, indicating a significant bleed. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially if the source is not controlled or"

The patient is a 69-year-old man with HIV, Hepatitis C, and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presents with a ruptured HCC lesion and hemoperitoneum. He has undergone embolization of the left hepatic artery, which was tolerated hemodynamically but caused severe pain. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, except for a slightly low blood pressure. He has received fluids and blood products, with a total input of 520 mL and output of 320 mL. His urine output is also 320 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented, with dry mucous membranes. His cardiovascular examination shows regular heart rhythm, and his chest is clear. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no evidence of edema in the right groin. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 259 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has a diagnosis of malignant neoplasm of the liver. The acute onset abdominal pain is concerning for hemorrhage from HCC metastases post intra-arterial chemoembolization. Pain management and close follow-up are recommended. Serial hematocrits"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male with HIV, HCV, and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presenting with acute onset abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum.
- He is currently in interventional radiology (IR) receiving chemoembolization for suspected hemorrhage from an HCC metastasis.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 127/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion with bibasilar crackles, distended abdomen with tender periumbilical area, and normal neurologic examination.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- The patient has a history of HIV, HCV, and HCC, and is currently being treated for acute illness/bleed with a hold on antiretroviral therapy (ARTs).
- The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring in the ICU, serial hemoglobin levels, pain control, follow-up of liver function tests after embolization, and discussion about restarting ARTs with the oncology and interventional radiology team."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old individual with HIV, HCV, and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient presented with acute onset abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum. The abdominal pain is likely related to hemorrhage from HCC and chemoembolization. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped by 4 points after being stable for 24 hours, indicating continued hemorrhage. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, possibly due to a stress reaction, and blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient also has transaminitis, which is likely secondary to chemoembolization. The patient's liver synthetic function appears preserved, and they have a documented do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The patient is currently on maintenance fluids and has two large bore IVs."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of HIV, Hep C, and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He presented with a ruptured HCC, which resulted in acute blood loss. The patient underwent an embolization procedure to control the bleeding. His current condition shows no evidence of worsening hemodynamic insult, but he has mild tachycardia. He has a modest decrease in hematocrit (HCT) from 30% to 26%, indicating anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient has discussed goals of care with his primary physician and has chosen a DNR/DNI status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient experienced significant blood loss due to the ruptured HCC. Although the bleeding was controlled with an embolization procedure, there is still a risk of hypovolemic shock if further bleeding occurs or if the patient's blood volume continues to decrease.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state with HIV and Hep C, he is at an increased risk of developing infections, especially in the ICU setting where he may be exposed to various pathogens.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As a patient with liver disease and ongoing liver damage from HCC, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as confusion, altered mental status, or other neurological symptoms.
4. Coagulopathy:"

   hemoperitoneum, and chemoembolization.  Abdominal pain is improved from
   yesterday.  No fevers or bandemia to suggest SBP.  Patient does not
   have a history of ascities or prior episodes of SBP.  Pain to be

   #3 Leukocytosis: likely stress reaction, afebrile.  Urine culture
   negative.  Abdominal pain improving.
   - Blood cultures pending.
   - consider diagnostic para if fevers or increasing leukocytosis with
   bandemia.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV, and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented with acute onset abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum. He underwent liver artery embolization three days prior to admission. The patient's abdominal pain has improved from yesterday, and there are no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) such as fever or bandemia. The pain is expected after the procedure, but further diagnostic paracentesis may be considered if there are fevers or increasing leukocytosis with bandemia.

The patient's hematocrit level remains stable over the past 24 hours. Active type and screen have been ordered, and the patient should maintain 2 large bore IVs. Serial HCTs will be done every six hours, and transfusion of HCT < 21 will be considered. If the HCT drops further, the interventional radiology (IR) team will be consulted to determine if additional imaging or procedures are necessary.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which is likely a stress reaction since he is afebrile and the urine culture is negative. Blood cultures are pending, and further diagnostic paracentesis may be required if there are fevers or increasing leukocytosis with bandemia.

The patient is experiencing constipation, which is likely due to narcotic medication use and low oral intake. Lactulose will be given today, and efforts will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of HIV, HCV, and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented with acute onset abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum. The patient underwent chemoembolization, which was likely related to the abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum. The abdominal pain is stable, and there are no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's hematocrit dropped by 4 points after being stable for 24 hours, suggesting continued hemorrhage. Further imaging or procedures may be necessary to address this. The patient also has leukocytosis, which is likely a stress reaction, and transaminitis, likely secondary to chemoembolization. The patient's HIV treatment has been restarted, and there are no acute issues with HCV. The patient has cirrhosis, but liver synthetic function appears preserved. The patient has a documented do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI) code status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued hemorrhage: The patient's hematocrit dropped significantly, indicating ongoing bleeding. This could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure if not addressed promptly.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be a sign of infection. If not properly managed, it may lead to sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with HIV, HCV, and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented with acute onset abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum. The patient has undergone chemoembolization, which has resulted in transaminitis. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped by 4 points after being stable for 24 hours, indicating continued hemorrhage. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued hemorrhage: The patient's Hct drop of 4 points suggests ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and further imaging or procedures may be necessary to identify the source of bleeding and control it.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient does not have a history of ascites or prior episodes of SBP, it is important to monitor for signs of infection, such as fever or leukocytosis with bandemia. Diagnostic paracentesis may be considered if these symptoms develop.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function may be compromised due to cirrhosis and HCC. Monitoring for changes in mental status or neurologic symptoms is important, as these can indicate hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Hepatitis C reactivation: Although the patient is currently not experiencing acute issues related to HCV, reactivation of hepatitis C infection can occur, especially in the setting of immunosuppression or liver dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo male admit with acute onset bleeding with likely ruptured hepatic
   lesion with loss of blood into peritoneum with resulting anemia and
   abdominal pain.  Patient has had reasonable stability of HCT in the
   setting of post embolization.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)=-
   -HCT check decrease to q 12 hours given stability and improvement in
   exam
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   -Still with significant discomfort which may be related to peritoneal
   irritation as well as post embolization pain from infarction
   -Continue with dilaudid
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER)
   -Improved LFT's following supportive care following embolization
   -Leukocytosis-
   -Diff needed on WBC count
   -Follow up cultures
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be post procedure
   -Consider Antibiotics for fevers in the setting of immuno-compromised
   state
   -Consider Paracentesis for possible ascites and infection and repeat
   abdominal imaging should WBC count continue to rise

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted with acute onset bleeding due to a ruptured hepatic lesion, resulting in anemia and abdominal pain. The patient underwent embolization and has shown stability in hemoglobin levels. The patient is still experiencing discomfort, which may be related to peritoneal irritation and post-embolization pain. Pain management with dilaudid is ongoing. The patient has a history of hepatic cancer and has shown improvement in liver function tests following supportive care. Leukocytosis is present, and a differential white blood cell count is needed. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's pain management plan includes continuing with dilaudid, and further evaluation may involve antibiotics for fevers, paracentesis for possible ascites and infection, and repeat abdominal imaging if the white blood cell count continues to rise. The patient is receiving ICU care, including a PO diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be transferred to the floor."
