   Assessment and Plan
   1. Biliary sepsis, Klebsiella bacteremia: Mentating clearly, does not
   look toxic.
   --Plan for ERCP this AM
   --Will continue zosyn and vancomycin, zosyn will cover Klebsiella
   isolated at OSH and vancomycin should cover GPC (though most likely
   contaminant).  Increased vancomycin to 1500mg daily given low trough
   this AM. Follow trough with changing renal function. Repeat blood and
   urine cultures, reculture if febrile and f/u OSH culture data.
   --Target CVP higher secondary to pulmonary hypertension - goal 15 to
   20. Start levophed for additional BP support if needed.
   --INR 1.7 yesterday but fibrinogen normal. Repeat DIC labs today.
   2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure with pulmonary infiltrates. Unclear
   what caused respiratory and hemodynamic decompensation yesterday at
   ERCP -- aspiration vs sepsis with ARDS. P/F ratio 180 c/w ARDS. Patient
   looks remarkably comfortable. Wedge may help assess cardiogenic vs.
   noncardiogenic etiology of edema on chest film. proBNP elevated
   --Continue intubation pre-procedure, attempt to wean vent tomorrow
   following ERCP
   --GPCs grown from [**3-12**] sputum sample, likely S. aureus.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   colonization rather than pna, but will be covered with vancomycin.
   3. Pulmonary hypertension: Probably secondary to patient's COPD
   --Consider adding sildenafil
   4. COPD
   --Continue tiotropium and prn atrovent/albuterol
   5. CAD
   EKG with diffuse T inversions not anatomic in distribution similar to
   EKG from [**3-11**] - CK's WNL, ?sepsis or post MI related, active ischemia
   is less likely.
   --Repeat EKG today. Continue ASA, hold beta blocker until off pressors
   6. Acute renal failure
   FeNa yesterday ~5%, may have had ATN secondary to hypotensive episodes.
   Cr improved today, follow. Urine output adequate.
   7. h/o heme positive stools
   Guiac stools, follow Hct transfuse Hb>7 (no active ischemia).
   8. hypernatremia
   Improved today following

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary infiltrates. The patient has a history of COPD, CAD, and recent heme-positive stools. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV mode, receiving ventilatory support. He has multiple comorbidities including biliary sepsis, Klebsiella bacteremia, pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia. The patient is being treated with various medications including vancomycin, Zosyn, lansoprazole, atorvastatin, tiotropium, and heparin. The patient's condition appears stable, with no major events overnight. Pressors have been weaned off.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biliary sepsis, Klebsiella bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, which can lead to biliary sepsis. This condition can cause systemic inflammation and potentially lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure with pulmonary infiltrates: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if not adequately supported by mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary infiltrates could indicate pneumonia or other lung complications, increasing the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's elevated pulmonary artery pressures suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension. This condition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cholangitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 88/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on 50% FiO2, and sinus rhythm. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 395 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 102.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when an infection triggers an overwhelming immune response throughout the body.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidney function has deteriorated rapidly, leading to acute renal failure. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the accumulation of waste products in the blood.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has developed pulmonary hypertension, which is characterized by increased blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. This can lead to strain on the right side of the heart"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Biliary sepsis, Klebsiella bacteremia: Mentating clearly, does not
   look toxic.
   --Plan for ERCP this AM
   --Will continue zosyn and vancomycin, zosyn will cover Klebsiella
   isolated at OSH and vancomycin should cover GPC (though most likely
   contaminant).  Increased vancomycin to 1500mg daily given low trough
   this AM. Follow trough with changing renal function.
   --Repeat blood and urine cultures, reculture if febrile and f/u OSH
   culture data.
   --Target CVP higher secondary to pulmonary hypertension - goal 15 to
   20. Start levophed for additional BP support if needed.
   --INR 1.7 yesterday but fibrinogen normal. Repeat DIC labs today.
   2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure with pulmonary infiltrates. Unclear
   what caused respiratory and hemodynamic decompensation [**3-11**] at OSH ERCP
   -- aspiration vs sepsis with ARDS. P/F ratio 180 c/w ARDS. Patient
   looks remarkably comfortable. Wedge may help assess cardiogenic vs.
   noncardiogenic etiology of edema on chest film. proBNP elevated
   --Continue intubation pre-procedure, attempt to wean vent following
   ERCP
   --GPCs grown from [**3-12**] sputum sample, likely S. aureus.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   colonization rather than pna, but will be covered with vancomycin.
   3. Pulmonary hypertension: Probably secondary to patient's COPD, follow
   hold of on vasodilatory agents (e.g. sildenafil) while on pressors
   4. COPD
   --Continue tiotropium and prn atrovent/albuterol
   5. CAD
   EKG with diffuse T inversions not anatomic in distribution similar to
   EKG from [**3-11**] - CK's WNL, ? post MI related, active ischemia seems less
   likely.
   --Repeat EKG today. Continue ASA, hold beta blocker until off pressors
   6. Acute renal failure
   FeNa yesterday ~5%, may have had ATN secondary to hypotensive episodes.
   Cr improved today, follow. Urine output adequate.
   7. h/o heme positive stools
   Guiac stools, follow Hct transfuse Hb>7 (no active ischemia).
   8. hypernatremia
   Improved today following

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with Klebsiella pneumonia. He underwent an ERCP procedure, during which he became hypoxemic and required intubation. He was transferred to another hospital and placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn antibiotics, as well as a dopamine drip. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring the restart of levophed and the placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter. His current vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of COPD, temporal arteritis, Waldenstrom's disease, and is a former heavy smoker. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the development of septic shock and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition indicates septic shock, which is a life-threatening complication of an infection. The presence of multiple positive cultures suggests an ongoing infection that needs to be addressed promptly.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by his low oxygen saturation levels and the need for mechanical ventilation. This could be due to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or non-cardiogenic causes.

3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's kidneys are showing signs of acute renal failure, indicated by the low urine output and elevated creatinine levels. This may be a result of the sepsis and inadequate perfusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the hospital with Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient's condition worsened during an ERCP procedure, leading to septic shock and respiratory failure. He was intubated and transferred to another hospital for further management. The patient has a history of COPD, temporal arteritis, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and is a former heavy smoker. He also has pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/53 mmHg to 112/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 317 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.28, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 89%.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 4.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished elderly individual admitted to the ICU with biliary sepsis. They underwent an ERCP procedure, which initially tolerated without significant changes in hemodynamic status. However, the patient worsened afterwards, requiring a ventilator change from pressure support to assist-control mode and eventually reaching maximum doses of levophed and vasopressin. Bilateral infiltrates were noted on a chest X-ray, a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio (<200), and no cardiac etiology. These findings suggested acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the patient was placed on ARDSnet ventilator protocol. The patient continued to deteriorate, requiring increasing FiO2 and persistent acidemia. An Apache score greater than 30 indicated severe illness, and the patient was started on Xigris. Viagra was given to reduce pulmonary artery hypertension, but the patient became hypotensive and received 500cc of lactated Ringer's solution.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 likely biliary in etiology
   -          continue vancomycin and pip/taz (for GPC and Klebsiella from
   OSH)
   -          bolus to CVP >15
   -          continue stress dose steroids and tight glycemic control
   -          continue levophed and vasopressin keeping MAP >65
   -          Sodium Bicarb for Art pH <7.20 for maximal efficacy of
   pressors
   -          continue Xigris x 96 hours total
   -          continue vent settings as close to ARDSnet as possible
   -          check [**Hospital1 **] PT/PTT, platelets while on Xigris
 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
   -          will have to adjust CVP goals accordingly
   -          does NOT tolerate sildenafil
 hypotension
   -          echo ordered to better assess
 CHOLANGITIS
 afebrile with no leukocytosis
   -          s/p ERCP with stenting
   -          vanc and zosyn as above for OSH isolates
 Acidosis
 Multiple contributors. PaCO2 is elevated, causing a
   respiratory acidosis contribution. Also, pt has a mild AG of 14 which
   is actually larger given his low albumin. The DDx of this includes
   lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion, but lactates have been WNL. Is
   slightly more uremic by labs today but not significantly so. No DKA. No
   known ingestions in hospital setting.
   -  treat with Na Bicarb to optimize pH for pharaceutical interventions.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   -          Continue ASA, statin
   -          No BB given hypotension
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          worsening, may be ATN from hypotension
   -          monitor urine output as dropping overnight
 COPD
   -          Continue tiotropium and prn atrovent/albuterol

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with biliary sepsis and has undergone an ERCP procedure. However, the patient's condition worsened after the procedure, leading to the need for ventilator changes and maximum use of levophed. The patient developed bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and no cardiac etiology, which suggested the possibility of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). As a result, the patient was started on ARDSnet ventilation protocol and received Xigris.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate is 66 bpm, blood pressure is 117/54 mmHg, respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished and elderly, with no significant abnormalities noted in the physical examination. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 174 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels.

Microbiology reports show the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on gram stain, suggesting a bacterial infection. Cultures for respiratory, blood, and urine are pending.

The patient's medical complications include sepsis with organ dysfunction likely of biliary origin, pulmonary hypertension, acidosis, coronary artery disease, acute renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"

   24 Hour Events:
 ENDOSCOPY - At [**2145-3-13**] 09:00 AM
   - ERCP w/ billiary stent placement done at bedside 0900-0945. Pt
   tolerated procedure w/o significant changes in hemodynamic status.
   However,  worsened afterwards, requiring vent change to AC from PS, and
   eventually max'ed out on levophed. Added vasopressin as second [**Doctor Last Name **].
   Noted to have b/l infiltrates on CXR, a P/F ratio <200, and no cardiac
   etiology (Calculated cardiac outpt and index to be acceptable via Fick
   equation), so suspected ARDS and changes to ARDSnet vent protocol. (TTE
   was ordered to confirm that CO was ok, but never performed). Continued
   to worsen with increasing FiO2 requirements and persistent acidemia.
   Received bicarb to allow optimal environment for vasopressive drugs.
   Apache score was >30. Pt was started on Xigris.
   - viagra was given in effort to reduce PAH but pt became hypotensive,
   got 500cc LR.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 likely biliary in etiology
   -          continue vancomycin and pip/taz (for MRSA and Klebsiella
   from OSH, respectively)
   -          bolus to CVP >15
   -          continue stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone) and tight
   glycemic control
   -          continue levophed and vasopressin keeping MAP >65
   -          No need for sodium bicarb for maximal efficacy of pressors
   even if pH <7.2
   -          continue Xigris x 96 hours total
   -          continue vent settings as close to ARDSnet as possible
   -          check [**Hospital1 **] PT/PTT, platelets while on Xigris
 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
   -          will have to adjust CVP goals accordingly
   -          does NOT tolerate sildenafil
 hypotension
   -          TTecho ordered to better assess
 CHOLANGITIS
 afebrile with no leukocytosis
   -          s/p ERCP with stenting
   -          vanc and zosyn as above for OSH isolates
 Acidosis
 Multiple contributors. PaCO2 is elevated, causing a
   respiratory acidosis contribution. Also, pt has a mild AG of 14 which
   is actually larger given his low albumin. The DDx of this includes
   lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion, but lactates have been WNL. Is
   slightly more uremic by labs today and this may be the metabolic cause
   for his AG acidosis. No DKA. No known ingestions in hospital setting.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   -          Continue ASA, statin
   -          No BB given hypotension
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          worsening, may be ATN from hypotension
   -          monitor urine output as dropping overnight
   -          would not bolus (or diureses) to achieve any specific urine
   output, is already anasarcic and hypotensive on pressors
 COPD
   -          Continue tiotropium when off vent; prn atrovent/albuterol

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with biliary sepsis and underwent an endoscopy with ERCP procedure. Post-procedure, the patient's condition worsened, leading to the initiation of advanced life support measures including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and renal failure. Laboratory results show signs of infection, organ dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging reveals bilateral effusions, volume loss/infiltrate in the lower lobes, and pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). Microbiology cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's worsening condition following the ERCP procedure suggests a potential septic response, likely due to biliary sepsis. Continued administration of appropriate antibiotics, stress dose steroids, tight glycemic control, and supportive care are necessary.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's increased pulmonary pressures and inability to tolerate sildenafil indicate the possibility of pulmonary hypertension. Adjusting CVP goals and monitoring for further signs of right heart strain are important.
3. Cholangitis: Although the patient is afebrile and without leukocytosis, recent ERCP with stenting for suspected cholangitis should be monitored closely with ongoing antibiotic therapy.
4. Acidosis: The patient has a mixed acid-base disorder, primarily respiratory acidosis secondary to elevated"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock due to cholangitis. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with billiary stent placement, which was tolerated without significant changes in hemodynamic status. The patient became hypotensive after starting Viagra, so it was held.

The patient is currently on several infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, vasopressin, drotrecogin, and norepinephrine. They are also receiving medications such as Lipitor, protonix, chlorhexidine, and medrol 100mg q8h.

Vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/53 to 117/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 25 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of (61/28) mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 16 mmHg. Cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) are reported as (5.26 L/min) and (3.1 L/min/m2), respectively. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is at 73%, with a range of 69-69%.

The patient's respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and spontaneous breathing trial deferred due to PEEP >10 and FiO2 >60%. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Pplat) is 20 cmH2O, and the patient's oxygenation parameters include a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 170.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with diminished breath sounds at the bases. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, while peripheral pulses are diminished on both extremities. Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Extremities show good perfusion, and neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, and moving all four extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 174 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and cholangitis who was transferred from the operating room to the ICU. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn), sedatives (fentanyl and midazolam), vasopressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine), and Drotrecogin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has evidence of hypotension and organ dysfunction likely secondary to sepsis, possibly related to biliary origin. He also has pulmonary hypertension and a history of coronary artery disease. The patient has acute renal failure and a history of COPD. His current medications include Lipitor, aspirin, tiotropium, albuterol, atrovent, lansoprazole, hydrocortisone, and Xigris.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's clinical presentation and lab results indicate severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely secondary to a biliary source. The antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) are appropriate for the suspected pathogens (MRSA and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and daily rec"

   -          Continue zosyn/vancomycin for Klebsiella/MRSA. Reculture if
   febrile and followup OSH cultures.
   -          Continue stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone)
 Hypotension
   -          Continue stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone)
   -          Shock probably a mixed picture
 with both septic and
   cardiogenic contributions. Patient came in with low SVR c/w septic
   state, but low SVO2 suggestive of poor tissue perfusion.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who was transferred from the outpatient setting (OSH) with cholangitis and subsequently underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient's current condition is severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely biliary in etiology. The attending physician has started the patient on antibiotics (zosyn/vancomycin) to cover for Klebsiella/MRSA, and plans to reculture if febrile and follow-up with OSH cultures. The patient is also receiving stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone) for hypotension and potential adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 25 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 214, and a ventilation-perfusion (Ve) of 10 L/min.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable with a heart rate (HR) of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 105/55 mmHg to 134/66 mmHg, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg. The patient has pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 55/26 mmHg. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels from 1.8 mg/dL to 2.9 mg/dL.

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.4 thousand/mm3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 134 thousand/mm3, and elevated liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 25 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 20 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) of 105 U/L, and total bilirubin (T Bili) of 0.5 mg/dL.

The patient's nutritional support includes the administration of Nutren Renal (Full) at a rate of 30 mL/hour. The patient's glycemic control is managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who was transferred from OSH with cholangitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure. The patient's systemic blood pressure dropped significantly after starting sildenafil, so it was discontinued. The patient has been receiving IV fluids to support his blood pressure. The attending physician spoke with the family about the seriousness of the patient's condition. The patient's blood in his urine did not stop Xigris. The patient is currently on several medications, including vancomycin, zosyn, fentanyl, midazolam, vasopressin, norepinephrine, drotrecogin, hydrocortisone, Xigris, albuterol, atrovent, lansoprazole, Lipitor, aspirin, and tiotropium. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of blood in his urine. The patient appears comfortable and denies any pain.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with septic shock and multiple medical complications. Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cholangitis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count and improving liver function tests, indicating an ongoing infection in the biliary system.

2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient is still experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction despite receiving appropriate antibiotics and other treatments. There are signs of inadequate fluid resuscitation as indicated by the PA catheter suggesting the patient is somewhat underfilled.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN): Although the patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, it is not currently a problem.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had an NSTEMI at another hospital, but no further episodes of ischemia have been reported. However, the patient may still require cardiac intervention due to their history of CAD.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are above baseline but stable since yesterday. Urine output is also low, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.

These are some of the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided. However, it is important to note that this analysis is not exhaustive and additional complications may be present or develop over time."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who was transferred to the ICU due to cholangitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure.

24-hour events include:
- Trans thoracic echo performed at 09:16 AM.
- Blood cultures were taken at 12:17 PM.
- An attempt was made to place a LiJ couln't pass catheter beyond 20cm stenosis.
- The patient experienced hematuria and heme+ stools while on Xigris.
- A total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were transfused, resulting in an improvement in SvO2 from 43% to 68%. The transfusion was used as a volume expander in the setting of ongoing bleed and is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a cardiogenic component to the patient's hypotension.
- The patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which showed an ejection fraction (EF) of ≥60%. The TTE also revealed right ventricular (RV) enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, moderate pulmonary artery (PA) systolic hypertension.
- The patient was started on an insulin drip for poor glucose control.
- FiO2 was increased to 60% and RR to 30 without improved ABG.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- Antibiotics were administered:"

   Imaging:
   CXR [**3-15**] in afternoon (wet read):
   No PTX.  Density over left supraclavicular soft tissues reflects known
   hematoma.   Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema and b/l effusions and
   atelectasis with increasing confluent opacity in the right mid-lung
   zone.
   Right PA catheter is in far, terminating in distal right PA.
   TTE [**2145-3-15**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) The right
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal left
   ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
   This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary pulmoanry
   process (COPD, pulmonary embolism, etc.).

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo gentleman with severe sepsis and cholangitis, s/p ERCP.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):
   -          sputum with MRSA, blood cultures from OSH with Klebsiella,
   now with budding yeast in blood
   -          continue zosyn, vanc; start caspofungin
   -          will contact ID re: yeast; appreciate their input
   -          continue stress dose steroids at present
   -          vanc supratherapeutic:  will stop daily vancomycin and check
   daily troughs until next dose needed
   -          hemodynamic data have demonstrated mixed picture, with
   evidence of sepsis and cardiogenic shock
   -          continue to provide fluids as needed to prevent tachycardia,
   hypotension, and urine output
   -          remove PA catheter and arterial line given new yeast
   infection; will need subclavian line
   -          continue vasopressin and levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -          not restarting Xigris b/c of significant blood loss
   (hematuria and heme+ stool requiring transfusion)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):
   -          paradoxically increased CO2 despite increasing RR on vent
   -          may have created autopeep; will try decreasing RR and
   recheck ABG
   -          currently with acceptable PO2 on 60% FiO2
   -          continues to show evidence of ARDS with PO2/FiO2 < 200
   -          fluid overloaded, but unable to diurese [**3-13**] hypotension
   # Acidosis:
   -          not able to compensate for respiratory acidosis b/c of
   chloride load from IV fluids
   -          if hydration needed, will give sodium bicarb
   -          monitor pH with regular ABGs
 CHOLANGITIS:
   -          s/p ERCP with stent
   -          continue vanc/zosyn as above
 ANEMIA, OTHER:
   -          appropriately incremented after getting RBCs
   -          continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct and transfuse for Hct < 24
 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN):
   -          avoiding sildenafil b/c it dropped his systemic BP
   -          TTE with moderate global RV hypokinesis, only 1+ TR
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   -          continue ASA 81 and statin; not on beta blocker b/c of
   hypotension
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -          most likely ATN after episodes of hypotension
   -          monitor Cr and urine output

","Summary:
An 83-year-old male with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia was admitted with cholangitis and subsequently underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient is currently in the ICU with severe sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. He has respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and acute kidney injury (ATN). The patient also has acute pulmonary hypertension, anemia, and coronary artery disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing severe sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Organ dysfunction: With the presence of multi-organ dysfunction, there is a risk of further deterioration in organ function, including the respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular systems.
3. ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. If not managed properly, ARDS can lead to respiratory failure and potentially death.
4. ATN: The patient's renal failure is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which is a common cause of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. ATN can result in long-term kidney damage or chronic kidney disease.
5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's acute pulmonary hypertension requires close monitoring and management. If left untreated, it can lead to right ventricular strain and"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])  - severe ARDS. Continuing
   to have pos fluid balance and is still requiring considerable PEEP and
   a high FIO2. Might need to measure Pes to better assess PEEP
   requirement
 CHOLANGITIS
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION) - [**5-14**] pos BC from [**Hospital3 629**]
   for Klebsiella and now a pos cx for yeast. Will start Caspo and discuss
   with ID. Off of APC. Needed higher pressor doses overnight. We are
   changing his lines today now that he is out further from his APC.
 ANEMIA, OTHER - 2ary to blood loss. Some of this is hematoma at line
   site
 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN) - substantial by echo.
   Likely worse due to ARDS and hypoxia. Primary problem is the RV
   distention compromising LV filling

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently experiencing multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Septic shock: The patient's initial chief complaint and ongoing concern. They have been diagnosed with severe sepsis, possibly due to Klebsiella infection and yeast infection.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient requires significant PEEP and high FiO2 levels, indicating severe respiratory distress. ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is mentioned but not confirmed.

3. Cholangitis: There is evidence of infection in the bile ducts, which could be contributing to the patient's overall septic state.

4. Anemia, other: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, including hematoma formation at the site of line insertion.

5. Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN): Substantial pulmonary hypertension has been detected, likely exacerbated by ARDS and hypoxia. This compromises right ventricular (RV) filling and left ventricular (LV) filling.

6. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which may contribute to their current critical condition.

7. Renal failure, acute (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, potentially due to sepsis and other factors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), further deterioration of"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Most recent blood gas shows improved pH. Repeat ABG this AM. Continue
   AC, wean as tolerated today.
   CXR with pulmonary edema with P/F of 143 concern for ARDS
   Has bilateral effusions, would consider tapping if oxygen requirements
   increase
   Has MRSA in sputum, covered with vancomycin
 CHOLANGITIS
   S/p ERCP with stent placement [**3-13**]. Blood cx from OSH grew Klebsiella
   pna.
   Continue vancomycin and zosyn, reculture if febrile. Vancomycin trough
   slightly elevated today can hold vancomycin and dose again tomorrow.
 Candidemia, suspected
   Blood cultures from transfer show yeast in 1 of 2 bottles from arterial
   line, patient at risk [**3-13**] broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids.
   Suspect [**Female First Name (un) **]. PA line removed, needs new A line. Continue
   caspofungin. Needs opthalmology exam today.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Urine output adequate ~40cc/hr yesterday. Target CVP ~15 given
   pulmonary hypertension.
   Decreased pressor requirements, on levophed and vasopressin. Target
   MAP>65.
   s/p Xigris, which was c/b some bleeding (hematuria and heme+ stools)
   Consider discontinuing stress dose steroids
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Hct decreased today in setting of recent Xigris, had hematuria and
   hematoma from line placement.
   Lower suspicion for DIC as INR stable at 1.2 today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with COPD and Waldenstrom's disease who was admitted with cholangitis. The patient has been started on caspofungin for yeast in the blood and needs an ophthalmology consult tomorrow. The patient had a right subclavian placed, and the Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued. A new arterial line placement was unsuccessful. The patient is now do not resuscitate (DNR). Pressors are being weaned with good success.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has bilateral effusions and concern for ARDS. Repeat ABG this AM. Continue AC and wean as tolerated today. Consider tapping if oxygen requirements increase.
2. Cholangitis: Continue vancomycin and Zosyn, reculture if febrile. Vancomycin trough slightly elevated today, can hold vancomycin and dose again tomorrow.
3. Candidemia, suspected: Blood cultures from transfer show yeast in 1 of 2 bottles from arterial line. Continue caspofungin. Needs ophthalmology exam today.
4. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): Decreased pressor requirements, on levophed and vasopressin. Target MAP >65.
5. Anemia, other: Hct decreased today in setting of recent Xigris, had hematuria and hematoma from line placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with COPD and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who was admitted with cholangitis. The patient started on caspofungin for yeast in the blood and had a right subclavian line placed, with the Swan-Ganz catheter being discontinued. A new arterial line placement was unsuccessful. The patient's pressors are being weaned successfully, and the patient has chosen to be DNR (Do Not Resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 143, indicating moderate hypoxemia. There is also evidence of a pressure ulcer present on the backside.

2. Cholangitis: The patient was admitted with cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts typically caused by bacterial infection. It can lead to sepsis if left untreated.

3. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, as indicated by the presence of systemic inflammation and organ involvement. This condition can result in multiple organ failure if not managed appropriately.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic disease or blood loss. Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with COPD and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia admitted with cholangitis. The patient's medical history indicates a series of complications and ongoing treatment for various conditions.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, most likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as indicated by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 143. The patient's condition has improved, but repeat ABG should be done to monitor progress. The patient's oxygen requirements may increase, and consideration should be given to tapping bilateral effusions.

2. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, which was treated with ERCP and stent placement on [**3-13**]. Blood cultures from OSH grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and Zosyn, and reculture is planned if the patient develops a fever. The vancomycin trough is slightly elevated today, but this can be addressed by holding vancomycin and redosing it tomorrow.

3. Candidemia: Suspected candidemia is present, as blood cultures from transfer show yeast in one of two bottles from the arterial line. The patient is at risk, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids have been administered. The PA line has been removed, and a new A-line is needed. Caspofungin should continue to be administered, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The summary of the note indicates that the patient is suffering from septic shock, respiratory failure (severe ARDS), cholangitis (which has improved after ERCP), severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), anemia, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening of respiratory failure due to the severity of ARDS, development of multi-drug resistant infections due to prolonged ICU stay and antibiotic use, further deterioration of renal function leading to renal failure, progression of pulmonary hypertension and its associated complications, potential cardiac events related to CAD, and ongoing management of anemia.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, ventilation, fluid balance, and daily lab results. Adjustments in the treatment plan may be necessary based on the patient's response to medications, changes in the clinical condition, and new developments in the laboratory findings. The patient's care should involve a multidisciplinary approach, including critical care specialists, infectious disease experts, pulmonologists, nephrologists, and cardiologists."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   P02 remains suboptimal despite increase in FiO2 back to 60% last
   evening. P/F ratio decreased from yesterday CXR with pulmonary edema
   with P/F of 130 c/w ARDS. .  Will maintain vent current settings
   nonetheless as Sat >90%
   Has bilateral effusions, would consider tapping if oxygen requirements
   increase
   Has MRSA in sputum, covered with vancomycin
 CHOLANGITIS
   S/p ERCP with stent placement [**3-13**]. Blood cx from OSH grew Klebsiella
   pna.
   Continue vancomycin and zosyn, reculture if febrile. Vancomycin trough
   slightly elevated today will hold today f/u level in AM
 Candidemia, suspected
   Blood cultures from transfer show yeast in 1 of 2 bottles from arterial
   line, patient at risk [**3-13**] broad spectrum antibiotics and recent
   steroids. Non albicans likely may be C. glabrata. LFTs yesterday WNL,
   no evidence of fungal retinitis on opthalmology exam.  Continue
   caspofungin.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Urine output adequate ~60cc/hr yesterday. Target CVP ~15 given
   pulmonary hypertension.
   Decreased pressor requirements, on levophed and vasopressin. Target
   MAP>65.
 ANEMIA and gastrointestinal bleeding
   Had some hematuria and heme+ stools while on Xigris, with grossly
   bloody stools yesterday off of Xigris
   Given BRBPR consider lower GI source
 consider ischemic colitis or
   diverticular bleeding, no h/o colon polyps. Upper GI source less likely
   as NG lavage negative. GI recommendations appreciated ?endoscopy
   Hct decreased from 33 -> 24. Labs suggest possible low level DIC. PTT
   slightly increased to 58 yesterday now back to 30
s off of subcutaneous
   heparin
 given 2units of FFP. After discussion with blood bank suspect
   PTT elevation secondary to drawing from line.
   Hct did not increase as expected from 2units (24->27 now back to 25)
   likely due to ongoing bleeding. No evidence of hemolysis Tbili normal.
   Hold ASA for now
   Transfuse Hb>7, follow [**Hospital1 **] Hct
 Thrombocytopenia
   Suspect consumptive process vs med related. Transfuse plts>50 consider
   higher threshold if ongoing bleeding
 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
   Moderate on TTE. Tolerated sildenafil poorly.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   Holding ASA, holding beta blocker in setting of pressor requirement.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Suspect ATN in setting of hypotension. Urine output acceptable. Cr
   stable at 1.8. AIN less likely urine eos negative. Repeat PM
   electrolytes
 Hypocalcemia
   Corrected calcium 8.0 using recent Alb of 2.0, will replete

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia admitted to the ICU with cholangitis. He has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, suspected candidemia, anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal failure, hypocalcemia, and potential disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygenation remains suboptimal despite adjustments in FiO2, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. Bilateral effusions are present, which could contribute to impaired gas exchange.
2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's condition suggests severe sepsis or septic shock, evidenced by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), organ dysfunction (renal, respiratory, coagulation), and hypotension requiring vasopressor support.
3. Suspected Candidemia: Blood cultures from the arterial line show yeast growth, suggesting a possible fungal infection, likely candidemia.
4. Anemia and Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has experienced hematuria, heme-positive stools, and a drop in hemoglobin levels, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to a consumptive process or medication-related factors"

   cholangitis
   24 Hour Events:
   Weaned vent to FiO2 50% then 40% but set back to 50% when PO2 was 69 at
   40%
   Removed A-line
   Decreased dose of levophed
   Had 3 episodes of stool with copious blood clots, one was large amount;
   Hct dropped from 33 to 24
   Transfused 2 units pRBCs with Hct bump to 27
   GI consulted, awaiting their final recs
   Concern that he had DIC-type picture, though INR was stable at 1.2 and
   fibrinogen also stable at 160
   Spoke with blood bank, who agreed it was reasonable to give FFP to help
   correct PTT (unclear why it rose, but stopped subQ heparin)

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia admitted to the ICU with cholangitis. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, suspected sepsis with organ dysfunction, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, acute renal failure, hypocalcemia, and suspected candidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern about the development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) based on the low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and the presence of bilateral effusions.

2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient has signs of systemic infection indicated by fever and elevated inflammatory markers. This could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.

3. Anemia and Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has experienced significant blood loss resulting in a drop in hemoglobin levels from 33 to 24. This can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ damage.

4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by echocardiography. This condition increases the risk of right heart strain and failure.

5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which puts him at risk for myocardial ischemia and infarction.

6. Acute Renal Failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with COPD and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia admitted to the ICU with cholangitis. The patient's health progress in the ICU is as follows:

- The patient was initially on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50%, but it was decreased to 40% and then set back to 50% due to a PO2 of 69 at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal range.
- The patient had three episodes of stool with copious blood clots, one being a large amount. This led to a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 33 to 24.
- The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), which increased the Hct to 27. The patient is awaiting further recommendations from the gastroenterology (GI) department.
- There is a concern that the patient may have a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-type picture, although the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and fibrinogen levels are stable at 1.2 and 160, respectively.
- The patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to help correct the partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The reason for the rise in PTT is unclear, but subcutaneous heparin was stopped.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):  PaO2 dropping, likely due
   to pulmonary edema in the setting of PRBCs.  Lack of response to
   increased FiO2 suggests shunt, which may be due to pulmonary
   hypertension.  PaO2 acceptable, will not change vent settings at this
   point.
 CHOLANGITIS
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Initially septic shock,
   progressing to hypovolemic shock in setting of GI bleed.  Will volume
   resuscitate with blood products, increase levophed for goal MAP >55,
   UOP.  Will cont vanc for MRSA pna, zosyn for klebsiella bacteremia, and
   caspofungin for fungemia.  Ophtho exam unremarkable.  Lines have been
   changed.
 ANEMIA, OTHER: Likely due to a GI bleed.  Initially ascribed to
   activated protein C, but continued bleeding in absence of this is
   concerning for sphincterotomy bleed.  GI is following, will discuss EGD
   with them.  Will transfuse PRBCs.  Also concern for DIC given
   coagulopathy, decreased platelets, and dropping fibrinogen.
 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE):  s/p recent
   NSTEMI.  Holding aspirin given GI bleed.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  UOP acceptable.
   Creatinine stable.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has been experiencing large bloody stools and increasing pressor requirements. The patient has a history of recent NSTEMI and coronary artery disease. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received antibiotics such as vancomycin, caspofungin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient is currently on infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient also has prophylactic heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for pulmonary edema and potential shunt due to pulmonary hypertension.
2. Cholangitis: The patient may have cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts.
3. Severe sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, progressing to hypovolemic shock in the setting of GI bleed. There is a concern for ongoing infection and bacteremia.
4. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia due to a GI bleed. This could be exacerbated by DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation).
5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which can complicate respiratory support.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a"
