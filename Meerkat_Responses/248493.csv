 .H/O DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   This is a 53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG
   who presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR, and initial
   PaCO2.  Likely source is pneumonia +/ skin infection +/ c.diff
   colitis.
   - Treat empirically for pneumonia with vanc, zosyn, levoflox
   - Sputum cxs, urine legionella Ag
   - Treat empirically for c.diff colitis with flagyl
   - Check c.diff toxin
   - KUB to evaluate for toxic megacolon/perforation
   - Check plain films of right foot to r/o extension into bone
   - Vanco and zosyn should also cover for diabetic foot ulcer
   - Arterial line for close hemodynamic monitoring
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   .
   # WCT - Concerning for VT versus SVT with aberrancy.  Currently in NSR
   on amiodarone gtt.  Of note QTc prolonged, will need to monitor, esp on
   levofloxacin.
   - Cycle cardiac markers
   - ECG in AM
   - Continue amiodarone for now
   - Cardiology c/s in AM
   .
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and ? acidosis.
   - A-line
   - ABG
   - Wean O2 as needed
   - Pressure support tomorrow if hemodynamics improved
   .
   # DKA - Secondary to infection.  AG now closed.  Will continue on
   insulin gtt for now given very elevated FSGs.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now
   - Q2 hour FSG checks
   - Correct electrolytes
   - Change to ISS when FSG improved
   .
   # Hyponatremia - Maybe secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of
   diarrhea.  Legionella also possible.
   - Urine lytes, osm
   - Cont trend following hydration
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Sepsis is possible etiology.  Too early to be
   HIT.
   - Check DIC labs
   - Meds reviewed
   - Obtain baseline plt count

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and tachycardia, indicating an infection. He also has a prolonged QTc interval on EKG, which may be related to medications or electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to pneumonia and/or a skin infection. It is important to continue treating the suspected sources of infection empirically and follow up with culture results.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) or Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient's initial EKG showed wide complex QRS rate in the 80s with pacer spikes, suggesting abnormal heart rhythm. Amiodarone is being administered, and further evaluation by cardiology is planned.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on his hemodynamic stability and respiratory function.

4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels suggest the possibility of DKA secondary to infection. Insulin infusion is being continued, and electrolyte imbalances should"

   OSH.  X rays [**2-6**] of both feet without evidence of osteo. Negative for
   influenza.
   - Treat empirically for pneumonia with vanc, levoflox,
   -Curbside ID today to discuss best tx for Grp B strep bacteremia.
   - Treat empirically for c.diff colitis with flagyl
   - Check c.diff toxin
   - need to replace Arterial line for close hemodynamic monitoring
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   -On levo gtt with goal MAP >60. Check SVO2

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with sepsis. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition and medical history. 

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic response to infection. The likely sources of infection are pneumonia, skin infection, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient is being treated empirically for pneumonia with vancomycin (Vanc) and levofloxacin, and for C. diff colitis with metronidazole (Flagyl). Blood cultures have tested positive for Group B strep bacteria at the Ohio State Hospital (OSH). 

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. He self-extubated in the early morning but was reintubated afterward. The plan is to wean him off the ventilator as tolerated and gradually advance to pressure support (PS) mode.

3. Wide complex tachycardia: The patient experienced wide complex tachycardia, which could be ventricular tachycardia (VT) or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. He is currently in a paced rhythm at 83 beats per minute (B"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM2) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. The infectious sources include left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and diabetic foot ulcer/osteomyelitis. He is also growing Group B strep in blood culture on vancomycin, levofoxacin, and flagyl. The patient is on levophed and intubated.

During the ICU stay, the patient experienced several events. He underwent an unremarkable bronchoscopy, had a multi-lumen femoral line placed, and then it was removed. He also had an arterial line placed and subsequently removed. The patient had an unplanned extubation, which was initiated by the patient himself, and he was reintubated. He had a fever of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics administered was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 05:00 AM on 02-06-2201, Levofloxacin at 03:00 AM on 02-07-2201, Metronidazole at 03:57 AM on 02-07-2201"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He is currently admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient has been intubated for respiratory failure and lethargy. He also has wide complex rhythm, likely due to pacing. The patient presented with anion gap ketoacidosis during his initial evaluation but the gap has since closed. He also has thrombocytopenia, which is likely secondary to sepsis and not related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The source of infection is still being investigated, with possible causes including oral flora and skin infection. Blood cultures have grown Group B strep. The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, vancomycin, penicillin G potassium, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a serious systemic infection. If left untreated or not properly managed, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in respiratory function if adequate weaning and lung protective strategies are not implemented.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with sepsis and has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, wide complex tachycardia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia. He is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, insulin, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with sepsis, likely due to pneumonia, skin infection, or Clostridium difficile colitis. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are required to manage this condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and careful monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
3. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient experienced wide complex tachycardia, which could be ventricular tachycardia (VT) or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy. The patient is now in a paced rhythm, but close cardiac monitoring is still required, especially considering the prolonged QTc interval.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was transferred from another hospital with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient also has group B streptococcus (GBS) growing in his blood culture, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and being supported with norepinephrine (levophed).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has GBS growing in his blood culture, indicating a bacterial infection. This could lead to sepsis, which is already suspected as the cause of his initial transfer to the ICU.

2. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of wide complex VT, which may recur or progress into other arrhythmias, posing a risk for cardiac complications.

3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels and acidosis suggest ongoing DKA. If not managed properly, this can lead to further complications such as cerebral edema, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) who was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently intubated and on levophed. The patient has Group B strep bacteremia and is being treated with penicillin based on sensitivities. There is concern for possible endocarditis or an oral source of infection. The patient also has a cardiac condition requiring valve replacement and bacteremia of unclear source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation included septic shock, and there is ongoing concern for sepsis due to Group B strep bacteremia.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's history of bacteremia and cardiac condition may increase the risk of endocarditis.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has wide complex VT, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient has a history of DM2 and presented with DKA, which requires careful monitoring and treatment.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

   Microbiology: Wound cultures from feet bilaterally with group B strep.
   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis
On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c
d vanc
   - will continue levo (day 1 = [**2201-2-6**]) for ?CAP but d/c flagyl as c.
   diff neg
   - TEE scheduled for Tuesday to r/o endocarditis (?new murmur on [**2-8**]
   though pt does have a history of valve surgery)
   -weaned off norepinephrine
   -speak to podiatry today about need for further imaging of foot in
   context of same organism isolated as from blood and ? osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure  - Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP
s will attempt to diurese today with furosemide drip
   aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will tolerate (keep
   SBP
s >60)
   -Complete five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.
   - continue ISS and standing insulin, follow fingersticks and titrate as
   needed
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely secondary to sepsis and temporally too
   early for HIT.  DIC labs neg [**2-6**] and now improving.
   -Continue to follow
   # FEN:  NPO (pulled out enteral feeding tube), hopefully can extubate
   and advance diet, if unable to wean will need new enteral tube
   # Access: R sided CVL (could potentially be pulled if extubated), PIV
   .
   # PPx:  p-boots, PPI
   .
   # Code:  full

   # Dispo:  pending improvement

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with sepsis. On admission, the patient met the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria with elevated white blood cell count (WBC), fever, heart rate (HR), and initial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The source of infection is unclear, but wound cultures from the feet showed growth of group B strep. The patient has been started on penicillin for strep and vancomycin has been discontinued.

The patient was intubated for lethargy and possible acidosis. After self-extubation, the patient was reintubated. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and chest X-ray did not indicate pneumonia. The patient's blood cultures are positive for group B strep, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is scheduled to rule out endocarditis.

The patient has respiratory failure and is currently on pressure support. The initial acidosis may be metabolic as there is little indication of a primary pulmonary process. The patient is being given a five-day course of levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's oxygenation and ventilation are adequate on pressure support, but they are more tachypneic after being placed on a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease who presents with sepsis. The patient met SIRS criteria upon admission with white blood cell count, fever, heart rate, and initial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. 

The source of infection is still being investigated, with pneumonia being unlikely due to negative bronchoalveolar lavage and clear chest X-ray. Other possibilities include oral flora and skin infection. Blood cultures have been obtained for Group B strep, and X-rays of both feet have been taken without evidence of osteomyelitis.

The patient was started on penicillin for strep and discontinued vancomycin. He will continue receiving levofloxacin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia but will discontinue metronidazole as Clostridium difficile is negative. Contact with Ohio regarding strep sensitivities has been made, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been scheduled for Tuesday to rule out endocarditis.

The patient is intubated for lethargy and suspected acidosis and was reintubated after self-extubation in the early morning of [**2-7**]. The plan is to change from assist-control ventilation to pressure support today with the intention to wean the ventilator as tolerated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with sepsis, which initially met the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria due to elevated white blood cell count, fever, heart rate, and initial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The source of infection is unclear, but wound cultures from the feet show growth of group B strep. However, the significance of this organism being present at the site of the patient's ulcers is unclear. The patient was started on penicillin for strep and discontinued vancomycin. 

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and is intubated for lethargy and possible acidosis. There is no indication of a primary pulmonary process on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or imaging. The patient was reintubated after self-extubation in the early morning. 

The patient has a wide complex rhythm and is paced due to a determination by the cardiology service that there is no acute process. 

The patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation, which has since closed. The patient is being monitored closely for any signs of infection or complications related to sepsis. 

The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to sepsis, and there is no evidence of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and other medications. His vital signs are stable, but he remains intubated for respiratory support. The patient's blood cultures have grown group B strep, and he is now on penicillin based on sensitivities. There are concerns about the source of infection, possibly an oral source or endocarditis. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and further evaluation with tests such as a TEE and follow-up cultures. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has sepsis, which is a serious infection that can lead to organ dysfunction. It is important to continue aggressive treatment and monitoring.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's wide complex VT needs to be closely monitored and managed. It may require further intervention, such as cardioversion or antiarrhythmic medications.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has DKA, which requires careful management of his blood sugar levels and electrolyte imbalances. Insulin therapy and IV fluids will be necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which"

Other potential sources include an oral source (patient pulled out a loose tooth a few days prior to admission) versus endocarditis. The patient's persistent fevers are possibly due to endocarditis, but other abscess/fluid collection cannot be ruled out. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned in the morning to evaluate for endocarditis and bacteremia of unclear source. The patient's respiratory status is concerning for ventricular tachycardia versus supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy, and a cardiology consult is pending. The patient remains intubated due to severe volume overload and will have a repeat spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with plans to extubate early afternoon or in the morning after the TEE is completed.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o M with CAD, DM2 transferred from OSH with septic shock, wide
   complex VT, DKA, thrombocytopenia.  Growing Group B strep in blood on
   PCN/levo.  Off levophed
 intubated.
    # Sepsis
 Group B strep in blood culture from OSH.  Unclear source,
   but now wound cultures growing group B strep.  Other sources include
   oral source (patient pulled out loose tooth a few days PTA) vs
   endocarditis.  Now off levophed.
   - Continue PCN.
   - Finish 10 day course of levo for possible CAP
   - F/U cultures
   - R/o C. diff
   #Persistent Fevers
 Possibly due to endocarditis, but other
   abscess/fluid collection cannot be r/o.
   - TEE in am
   - If negative, consider pan scan to r/o dental source or abdominal
   source
   - ID consult in am if still febrile
   # WCT - Concerning for VT versus SVT with aberrancy.
   - S/p cards c/s
   - TEE on Tuesday for AVR replacement and bacteremia of unclear source
   - F/U EKG
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and acidosis.  Now remains
   intubated with severe volume overload.  Passed SBT, but then appeared
   tachypneic.  Will leave intubated and rest throughout am with attempt
   diuresis.  Repeat SBT with plans to extubate early afternoon.
   - Diuresis
   - SBT this afternoon

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis:  On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c
d vanc
   - has completed course of levo (2/13
 [**2-10**]) for ?CAP but d/c
d flagyl
   as c. diff neg
   - TEE scheduled for today to r/o endocarditis (?new murmur on [**2-8**]
   though pt does have a history of valve surgery)
   - CT torso to r/o abscess
   - ID consult
   - weaned off norepinephrine
   - speak to podiatry about ?MRI foot in context of same organism
   isolated as from blood and ? osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP
s will attempt to continue diuresis today with
   furosemide drip aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will
   tolerate (keep SBP
s >60)
   -S/p five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.
   - continue ISS and standing insulin, follow fingersticks and titrate as
   needed
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely secondary to sepsis and resolved as of
   [**2201-2-10**].  DIC labs neg [**2-6**].
   -Continue to follow
   - restart hep sc
   # FEN:  NPO (pulled out enteral feeding tube), hopefully can extubate
   and advance diet, if unable to wean will need new enteral tube
   # Access: R sided CVL (could potentially be pulled if extubated), PIV
   # PPx:  p-boots, PPI, hep sc
   # Code:  full
   # Dispo:  pending improvement

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis
On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c
d vanc
   - will continue levo (day 1 = [**2201-2-6**]) for ?CAP but d/c flagyl as c.
   diff neg
   - TEE scheduled for Tuesday to r/o endocarditis (?new murmur on [**2-8**]
   though pt does have a history of valve surgery)
   -weaned off norepinephrine
   -speak to podiatry today about need for further imaging of foot in
   context of same organism isolated as from blood and ? osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure  - Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP
s will attempt to diurese today with furosemide drip
   aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will tolerate (keep
   SBP
s >60)
   -Complete five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.
   - continue ISS and standing insulin, follow fingersticks and titrate as
   needed
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely secondary to sepsis and temporally too
   early for HIT.  DIC labs neg [**2-6**] and now improving.
   -Continue to follow
   # FEN:  NPO (pulled out enteral feeding tube), hopefully can extubate
   and advance diet, if unable to wean will need new enteral tube
   # Access: R sided CVL (could potentially be pulled if extubated), PIV
   # PPx:  p-boots, PPI
   # Code:  full
   # Dispo:  pending improvement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with sepsis and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102.1°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/58 mmHg to 128/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 343 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH 7.40, PaCO2 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 243.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.7 thousand/mm3, elevated glucose level of 152 mg/dL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, normal platelet count of 189 thousand/mm3, and elevated lactate level of 2.0 mmol/L.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o M with CAD, DM2, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with septic shock,
   wide complex VT, DKA, thrombocytopenia.  Growing Group B strep in blood
   and found to have florid endocarditis with vegs on aortic valve, pacer
   wire, and with concerns for abscess of homograft.  Off levophed
   intubated.
   # Sepsis
 Group B strep in blood culture from OSH causing
   endocarditis, which has a high mortality rate.  Unclear source, but now
   wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium.  Other sources
   include oral source (patient pulled out loose tooth a few days PTA).
   Now off levophed.
   - Continue PCN + gent.
   - Finish 10 day course of levo for possible CAP
   - F/U cultures
   - R/o C. diff
   - Pan CT scan to eval for embolic phenomenon
   #Persistent Fevers
 Possibly due to endocarditis, but other
   abscess/fluid collection from septic emboli cannot be r/o.
   - CT scan as above
   - ID consult today
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and acidosis.  Now remains
   intubated with severe volume overload.  Failed SBT. Will leave
   intubated and rest throughout am with attempt diuresis.  Also with
   large L pleural effusion with concerns for empyema.
   - Diuresis
   - Thoracic CT scan
 may need pigtail if evidence of infected fluid

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was transferred from the outpatient setting (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. Cultures have grown Group B strep, which is causing florid endocarditis with vegetations on the aortic valve, pacer wire, and concerns for abscess of homograft. The patient is intubated and currently off levophed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to Group B strep in the blood culture causing endocarditis, which has a high mortality rate. Other potential sources of infection include oral sources and wound infections.
2. Persistent Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, possibly due to endocarditis. Other possibilities include abscesses or fluid collections from septic emboli.
3. Respiratory: The patient is intubated for lethargy and acidosis. He remains intubated with severe volume overload and failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). There is a large left pleural effusion with concerns for empyema.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, possibly due to inadequate fluid replacement.
5. Other issues: The patient's condition"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was transferred from the outside hospital (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with sepsis caused by Group B strep in the blood culture and is being treated with penicillin. The patient also has persistent fevers, possibly due to endocarditis, and will undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis. The patient's respiratory status is complicated by severe volume overload, and he failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). He will remain intubated and will be given diuretics to manage the volume overload. Other issues include wound cultures growing Group B strep and Corynebacterium, and a loose tooth that the patient pulled a few days prior.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already been diagnosed with sepsis caused by Group B strep in the blood culture. If the infection spreads or if the source of infection cannot be controlled, there is a risk of further deterioration in the patient's condition.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's persistent fevers may be indicative of"

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine (Levophed) and antibiotics (penicillin and levofoxacin). Cultures have grown group B streptococcus (GBS) in the blood, and wound cultures are also positive for GBS and Corynebacterium. The source of infection is unclear, but possibilities include endocarditis, an oral source (patient pulled out a loose tooth), or another source. The patient's persistent fevers may be due to endocarditis, but other abscesses or fluid collections cannot be ruled out. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to evaluate for endocarditis, and if negative, a pan scan may be considered to rule out dental or abdominal sources. The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with severe volume overload and failure of a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). He will remain intubated, and attempts will be made to initiate diuresis and repeat the SBT in the morning"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o M with CAD, DM2, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with septic shock,
   wide complex VT, DKA, thrombocytopenia.  Growing Group B strep in blood
   and found to have florid endocarditis with vegs on aortic valve, pacer
   wire, and with concerns for abscess of homograft.  Off levophed
   intubated.
   # Sepsis
 Group B strep in blood culture from OSH causing
   endocarditis, which has a high mortality rate.  Unclear source, but now
   wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium.  Other sources
   include oral source (patient pulled out loose tooth a few days PTA).
   Now off levophed.
   - Continue PCN + gent.
   - Finish 10 day course of levo for possible CAP
   - F/U cultures
   - R/o C. diff
   - Pan CT scan to eval for embolic phenomenon
   #Persistent Fevers
 Possibly due to endocarditis, but other
   abscess/fluid collection from septic emboli cannot be r/o.
   - CT scan as above and TEE today
   - ID consult today
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and acidosis.  Now remains
   intubated with severe volume overload.  Failed SBT. Will leave
   intubated and rest throughout am with attempt diuresis.  Also with
   large L pleural effusion with concerns for empyema.
   - Diuresis
   - Thoracic CT scan
 may need pigtail if evidence of infected fluid
   collection
   #Hypernatremia - FWF

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been diagnosed with florid endocarditis caused by Group B strep, with vegetations on the aortic valve, pacer wire, and concerns for an abscess of the homograft. He is currently intubated and off levophed.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by Group B strep in the blood culture, leading to endocarditis. This condition has a high mortality rate. The source of the infection is unclear, but wound cultures are growing Group B strep/Corynebacterium. Other potential sources include an oral source (the patient pulled out a loose tooth a few days prior). The plan includes continuing PCN + gentamicin, finishing a 10-day course of levo for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), following up with cultures, ruling out Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and performing a pan computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for embolic phenomena.

2. Persistent fevers: The patient"

   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP

   furosemide drip aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will
   tolerate (keep SBP

   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

1. Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE): The patient had a TEE that revealed vegetations on the aortic valve, ICD leads (with one lead in the right atrium), inferior vena cava (IVC), and a possible aortic root abscess. No mitral vegetation was observed. The patient has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis, and it is expected that he will need the ICD wires removed. Gentamicin has been added for synergy.

   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Also has
   a history of pulling his own tooth and swallowing the tooth two days
   prior to admission.  TEE on [**2201-2-10**] demonstrated diffuse endocarditis
   involving ICD wires, aortic valve, right atrium.  Pneumonia also
   unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease who presented with sepsis. The patient has undergone a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which showed vegetations on the aortic valve, ICD leads, inferior vena cava (IVC), and a possible aortic root abscess. No mitral vegetation was observed. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation, wide complex rhythm, thrombocytopenia, and anion gap ketoacidosis. The patient has been started on appropriate antibiotics and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The presence of vegetations on the aortic valve and ICD leads suggests a possible diagnosis of endocarditis. This can lead to further complications such as heart valve damage, heart failure, or embolic events.
2. Abscess formation: The TEE findings indicate a possible aortic root abscess, which can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with sepsis requires careful management to prevent further deterioration and potential organ failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitates continued mechanical ventilation support to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Wide complex rhythm: The presence of a wide complex rhythm suggests a possible cardiac conduction abnormality or arrhythm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was transferred from the operating room (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been diagnosed with group B strep bacteremia and florid endocarditis involving the aortic valve, pacer wire, and concerns for an abscess of a homograft. The patient is intubated and off levophed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to group B strep bacteremia causing endocarditis, which has a high mortality rate. Other potential sources of infection include oral sources (patient pulled out a loose tooth a few days prior) and wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has florid endocarditis involving the aortic valve, pacer wire, and concerns for an abscess of a homograft. This condition can lead to further complications such as heart failure, embolic phenomena, and systemic spread of infection.
3. Respiratory Issues: The patient remains intubated due to cardiac issues and failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PS"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was transferred from the outpatient setting (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient was found to have growing Group B strep in blood cultures and subsequently diagnosed with florid endocarditis involving the aortic valve, pacer wire, and concerns for abscess of homograft. He is currently intubated and off levophed.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has an ongoing infection due to Group B strep, which has led to endocarditis. Endocarditis is a serious infection that can result in high mortality rates if not properly treated.

2. Persistent Fevers: The patient continues to have fevers, which could be attributed to endocarditis or other abscess/fluid collections from septic emboli. Further evaluation with CT scan and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to determine the cause.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient remains intubated due to severe volume overload and failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). There is also a large left pleural effusion with concerns for empyema. Diuretics"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He was transferred from the operating room (OSH) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. Cultures showed growing Group B strep in the blood, indicating florid endocarditis with vegetations on the aortic valve, pacer wire, and concerns for abscess of homograft. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of Group B strep in the blood culture suggests ongoing sepsis, which can lead to further systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially multiple organ failure.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has florid endocarditis with vegetations on the aortic valve and possible abscess formation. This condition can result in heart valve damage, embolic phenomena, and systemic complications if left untreated.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to lethargy and acidosis. Failure to wean off mechanical ventilation may indicate prolonged respiratory failure, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although resolved at present, the patient's recent episode of DKA poses a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient has been off pressors since [**2-9**], source
   of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on broad spectrum
   antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day course of
   levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl for C.diff
   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had starteed
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation
   .
   # Wide-Complex Tachycardia - EP eval - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secodary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 27 trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline,
   will guaiac stools, check iron studies
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - Pending clinical improvement

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He has been diagnosed with Group B Strep Endocarditis, which is a prosthetic device-related infection. The source of entry is likely from foot ulcers. Blood cultures were taken through a nasogastric tube (NGTD) and also showed Group B Strep at the outpatient setting (OSH Cx). A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed significant involvement of the aortic graft and pacer lead.

The patient has been started on penicillin and gentamicin as per the recommendations of the Infectious Disease (ID) specialist, Electrophysiology (EP), and Cardiothoracic (CT) surgery. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further evaluation is planned to rule out osteomyelitis in the foot ulcers. A CT head showed no acute process or abscesses, while a CT torso showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD) and periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis.

The patient has experienced septic shock, but is currently hemodynamically stable off pressors. He has completed a 5-day course of levaquin for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and was on empiric flagyl for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) but discontinued today due to negative testing. The patient's lactate levels have normalized, white blood cell (WBC) count is falling, and screening blood cultures have been negative so far.

The patient was intubated for lethargy on admission and reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30% and reported tachypnea during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Diuretics with lasix were started but discontinued due to hypotension. A chest X-ray showed opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe consolidation.

The patient's bilateral foot ulcers were evaluated by podiatry, which reported mild serosanguinous drainage on the right foot and no drainage on the left. X-rays of both feet were negative for osteomyelitis. Given the Group B Strep bacteremia and the presence of serosanguinous drainage from the feet, further evaluation is needed to rule out osteomyelitis.

The patient experienced wide-complex tachycardia, which is most likely secondary to fever, underlying infection, and intravascular depletion. The underlying factors are being treated as mentioned above, and the patient's vital signs are being closely monitored.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is currently being managed with insulin gtt for tight glycemic control in the setting"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.  Will clarify
   surgical plan with CT [**Doctor First Name **] and EP.
   - Per CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Cath, panorex, and carotid US.  Carotid US done.
   Will attempt to obtain oral cavity imaging
 d/w dental.  However need
   to rule out other sources of infection prior to going ahead with
   surgery.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate  -
   very sensitive to PCN.
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy.
   - Briefly discussed initiation of heparin for anticoagulation.  Will
   hold for now.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had started
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even.  Appears
   euvolemic.
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   - Will discuss with [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] regarding prior barriers to extubation.
   - ? collapsed lung on CXR/CT scan with air trapping.  Will discuss with
   pulmonary today - ? bronch
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 24 today trending down from 37 on admission, unclear
   baseline.
   - Follow up hemolysis labs. Could be due to direct toxicity of the
   infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools.  Negative x 1.  NG tube output is green, no
   visible blood.  Mucus without blood.
   - Checking iron studies. Expect anemia of inflammation but may also be
   def in iron and or B12 which
   - Transfusing 1U pRBC today ([**2201-2-12**]).  f/u PM hct.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks.  Range is 80-120 for
   blood glucose.   Closely monitor when restart tube feeds today.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.  The patient has been off pressors
   since [**2-9**], source of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on
   broad spectrum antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day
   course of levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl
   for C.diff but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation.  Impt to rule out infection prior to OR.
   .
   # Vpacing - EP eval while in [**Name (NI) 10**] - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secondary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF today.  No
   procedures today.
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - Pending clinical improvement.

   Chief Complaint: transfer for endocarditis
   24 Hour Events:
   patient admitted to the CCU. please see admission note for details.
   - CT surgery recs were catherization, dental and carotid ultrasound do
   not plan to operate anytime soon
   - placed order for portable panorex which apparently is not possible,
   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note reccomendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.
   - had some blood tinged NG tube contents, so changed PPI to IV BID
   - given continuing to fall crit ordered one unit of blood

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient has been off pressors since [**2-9**], source
   of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on broad spectrum
   antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day course of
   levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl for C.diff
   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had starteed
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation
   .
   # Wide-Complex Tachycardia - EP eval - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secodary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 27 trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline,
   will guaiac stools, check iron studies
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair, CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep Endocarditis. The patient has an apparent prosthetic device-related endocarditis. There is uncertainty regarding the entry site, but it is likely from foot ulcers. Blood cultures were obtained through NG tube, but OSH culture showed GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement. Due to the presence of prosthetic material, the likelihood of cure with medical management alone is low. CT surgery and EP consults have been placed.

The patient has a pacer placed due to CHB and would need temporary wire. The patient is currently on Penicillin and gentamicin. ID, EP, and CT surgery are following up. Surveillance cultures and final MICs on OSH GBS isolate will be obtained. The patient will continue with penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin.

The patient has been off pressors since [2-9], and the source of sepsis is Group B strep bacteremia. The patient initially received broad-spectrum antibiotics, which have been tailored as above.

   24 Hour Events:
   patient admitted to the CCU. please see admission note for details.
   - CT surgery recs were catherization, dental and carotid ultrasound do
   not plan to operate anytime soon
   - placed order for portable panorex which apparently is not possible,
   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note reccomendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.

The patient is admitted to the CCU for endocarditis. The patient underwent CT surgery recommendations, including catheterization, dental, and carotid ultrasound. The order for a portable panorex was placed but not possible at the moment. The patient had blood-tinged NG tube contents, so PPI was changed to IV BID. The patient received one unit of blood due to continuous falling critical ordered. The patient was kept NPO without tube feeds in case of a procedure today.

   24 Hour Events:
   patient admitted to the CCU. please see admission note for details.
   - CT surgery recs were catherization, dental and carotid ultrasound do
   not plan to operate anytime soon
   - placed order for portable panorex which apparently is not possible,
   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note recommendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.
   - had some blood tinged NG tube contents, so changed PPI to IV BID

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.  Will clarify
   surgical plan with CT [**Doctor First Name **] and EP.
   - Per CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Cath, panorex, and carotid US.  Carotid US done.
   Will attempt to obtain oral cavity imaging
 d/w dental.  However need
   to rule out other sources of infection prior to going ahead with
   surgery.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate  -
   very sensitive to PCN.
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy.
   - Briefly discussed initiation of heparin for anticoagulation.  Will
   hold for now.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had started
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even.  Appears
   euvolemic.
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   - Will discuss with [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] regarding prior barriers to extubation.
   - ? collapsed lung on CXR/CT scan with air trapping.  Will discuss with
   pulmonary today - ? bronch
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 24 today trending down from 37 on admission, unclear
   baseline.
   - Follow up hemolysis labs. Could be due to direct toxicity of the
   infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools.  Negative x 1.  NG tube output is green, no
   visible blood.  Mucus without blood.
   - Checking iron studies. Expect anemia of inflammation but may also be
   def in iron and or B12 which
   - Transfusing 1U pRBC today ([**2201-2-12**]).  f/u PM hct.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks.  Range is 80-120 for
   blood glucose.   Closely monitor when restart tube feeds today.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.  The patient has been off pressors
   since [**2-9**], source of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on
   broad spectrum antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day
   course of levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl
   for C.diff but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation.  Impt to rule out infection prior to OR.
   .
   # Vpacing - EP eval while in [**Name (NI) 10**] - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secondary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF today.  No
   procedures today.
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI [**Hospital1 **]

1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has an apparent prosthetic device-related endocarditis caused by Group B Strep. This infection is serious and may require surgical intervention due to the presence of prosthetic material.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for lethargy on admission and reintubated after self-extubation. He is currently on PSV with PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, and reported tachypnea during SBT. The CXR shows opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe consolidation. This indicates a potential respiratory failure, which may require further intervention such as bronchoscopic evaluation or"

   Chief Complaint: transfer for endocarditis
   24 Hour Events:
   patient admitted to the CCU. please see admission note for details.
   - CT surgery recs were catherization, dental and carotid ultrasound do
   not plan to operate anytime soon
   - placed order for portable panorex which apparently is not possible,
   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note recommendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.
   - had some blood tinged NG tube contents, so changed PPI to IV BID
   - given continuing to fall crit ordered one unit of blood
   - kept patient NPO without tube feeds in case of procedure today

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had starteed
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 27 trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline.
   - Sending hemolysis labs. Could be due to direct toxicity of the
   infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Checking iron studies. Expect anemia of inflammation but may also be
   def in iron and or B12 which
   - Transfusing 1U pRBC today ([**2201-2-12**])
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient has been off pressors since [**2-9**], source
   of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on broad spectrum
   antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day course of
   levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl for C.diff
   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation
   .
   # Wide-Complex Tachycardia - EP eval - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secodary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement, AVR with abscess repair, CHB with PPM, and now diagnosed with Group B Strep Endocarditis. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to the endocarditis. He has an apparent prosthetic device-related endocarditis, likely originating from foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD, but OSH Cx showed GBS. TEE revealed significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement. CT head and torso showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above.

Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has an apparent prosthetic device-related endocarditis, likely originating from foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD, but OSH Cx showed GBS. TEE revealed significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement. CT head and torso showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.  Will clarify
   surgical plan with CT [**Doctor First Name **] and EP.
   - Per CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Cath, panorex, and carotid US.  Carotid US done.
   Will attempt to obtain oral cavity imaging
 d/w dental.  However need
   to rule out other sources of infection prior to going ahead with
   surgery.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate  -
   very sensitive to PCN.
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy.
   - Briefly discussed initiation of heparin for anticoagulation.  Will
   hold for now.
   - Bone scan today for osteo
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had started
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Self extubated and doing well now.
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even.  Appears
   euvolemic.
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   - Will discuss with [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] regarding prior barriers to extubation.
   - ? collapsed lung on CXR/CT scan with air trapping.  Will continue to
   follow as pt now extubated and comfortable
   .
   # Anemia - HCT trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline.
   Bumped appropriately to 28.8 from 24 with 1U pRBC but continues to
   trend down.
   - No signs of hemolysis. Retics low and ferritin very elevated
   consistent with anemia of inflammation. Could also be due to direct
   toxicity of the infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or
   drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools.  Negative x 1.  NG tube output is green, no
   visible blood.  Mucus without blood.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks.  Range is 80-120 for
   blood glucose.   Closely monitor when restart tube feeds today.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.  The patient has been off pressors
   since [**2-9**], source of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on
   broad spectrum antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day
   course of levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl
   for C.diff but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation.  Impt to rule out infection prior to OR.
   .
   # Vpacing - EP eval while in [**Name (NI) 10**] - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secondary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF today.  No
   procedures today.
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair, as well as CHB s/p PPM. He is currently in the ICU with several ongoing issues.

1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has signs of prosthetic device-related endocarditis, likely originating from foot ulcers. Blood cultures show GBS, and TEE indicates significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement. Given the presence of prosthetic material, medical management alone may not be sufficient, and surgical intervention is being considered. The patient is currently on penicillin and gentamicin.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for lethargy on admission and reintubated after self-extubation. He is currently on pressure support ventilation with PEEP 5, FiO2 30%, and reported tachypnea during spontaneous breathing trials. CXR shows opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe consolidation. The patient self-extubated but is doing well now.

3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is trending down from 37 on admission, and the cause is unclear. The anemia could be due to direct toxicity of the infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity. No signs of hemolysis are observed, and the patient's retics are low"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with an aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He also has CHB s/p PPM and is currently diagnosed with Group B Strep Endocarditis involving the prosthetic aortic valve. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/45 to 107/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient has been receiving gentamicin and penicillin G potassium for synergy in treating the endocarditis. The bone scan showed non-specific uptake at the first metatarsopalangeal joint, and a white blood cell scan may be considered for further evaluation. The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss and inflammation, and his diabetes mellitus type II is being managed with Lantus and HISS pre-meal. 

The patient previously experienced septic shock but has since resolved. He also has bilateral foot ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and is currently on a PO diet with modifications per speech & swallow service. His access lines include a right internal jugular line that has been disconnected and will be replaced with a PICC line. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin subcutaneously and a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root, CHB s/p PPM, and now diagnosed with Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker as well as aortic valve. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which has since resolved. Other significant findings include anemia, septic shock, bilateral foot ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient is being treated with penicillin and gentamicin for synergy. Close monitoring of the patient's response to antibiotics is necessary. Failure to respond or development of resistance may require alternative antibiotic therapy.
2. Infected Pacemaker Leads: Large vegetations on the pacemaker leads may make removal difficult. Close coordination with electrophysiology (EP) services will be required to determine if temporary wires are needed if pacer wires are removed. The plan is currently to manage medically.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is low, indicating anemia. The primary cause appears to be blood loss and inflammation. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's diabetes control needs to be closely monitored. Transition to Lantus and H"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. Vital signs show an elevated temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 94/47 mmHg to 107/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient is not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or movement functions, indicating potential impaired physical mobility.
2. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome): The patient's elevated temperature and altered mental status suggest a possible systemic inflammatory response.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and reliance on mechanical ventilation indicate acute respiratory failure.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has significantly elevated blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia.
5. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient exhibits signs of infection, such as fever and altered mental status, which may suggest sepsis without organ dysfunction.
6. Sepsis, Severe (With Organ Dysfunction): Considering the patient's altered mental status and potential organ dysfunction, there is a possibility of"

1. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. They also have CHB with a pacemaker placement and now present with Group B Strep Endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. ID and CV surgery are following the case.

2. The patient is being treated for Group B Strep Endocarditis with penicillin and gentamicin. Osteomyelitis or other occult infections need to be ruled out prior to going to the operating room. A bone scan was done, but it showed non-specific findings, and podiatry will assess for osteomyelitis.

3. The patient has infected pacer leads, and large vegetations might make it difficult to remove them immediately. EP is following the case, and adjustments have been made to sensing to determine if temporary wires would be needed if pacer wires are removed.

4. The patient has resolved respiratory failure and is now on a nasal cannula. Oxygen weaning may require additional diuresis. Lasix is being given q AM, and pulmonary recommendations are appreciated.

5. The patient has anemia likely due to blood loss and inflammation. Hct has been stable, and gastroocult testing is positive with NGT secretions. The patient is on ["

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with an aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He has also had a cardiac pacemaker placement (CHB s/p PPM) and is currently dealing with Group B Strep Endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications including respiratory failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, septic shock, bilateral foot ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and difficulty with enteral feeding (FEN).

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of foot ulcers and a bone scan revealed non-specific uptake, which raises the possibility of osteomyelitis. If left untreated, it can lead to further infection and complications.
2. Heart failure: The patient's history of aortic root replacement and infected pacemaker suggest a compromised cardiovascular system. If the endocarditis is not properly managed, it can progress to heart failure.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction. This can be exacerbated by septic shock and inadequate perfusion.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has experienced respiratory failure in the past and requires continuous oxygen support. Weaning off oxygen"

   .
    consulted podiatry again plan to see in AM, will help us interpret
   results of bone scan and definitively rule out osteomyelitis
   - [**Last Name (un) **] called nuclear, no one home, [**Last Name (un) **] emailed nuclear rads regarding
   best way to rule out osteo, awaiting reply
   - ID reccomending holding the course, cont antibiotics
   - plan initially to call out to the floor however patient was
   hypotensive to 70s with movement
   - did full neuro exam: significant for decreased vision OU, OS worse
   than OD, OD able to read, OS able to count fingers - as per patient
   this is a chronic problem for 2 years, patient has IOL b/l also history
   of ? retinal issue likely from diabetes
   - will need to call outpatient ophthalmology Monday to get detailed
   information
   - increased Lantus dose this morning
   - placed PICC consult, unable to do bed side PICC so will need to do IR
   guided PICC, consult placed
   - keep IJ in place until PICC placed

   Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. ID and CT
   surgery following.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve - plan is for
   patient to go to surgery although need to rule out osteomyelitis or
   other occult infection prior to going to OR. ID and CV surgery have
   been following. Reconsulted podiatry [**2-14**] to assess for osteomyelitis,
   bone scan only included foot was non-specific.
   - podiatry to see this morning and to have attending look at bone scan
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for synergy
   - gent trough [**2-14**] was 1.1
   - f/u daily ID recs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is endocarditis. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with an aortic homograft on 09/28, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root on 03/29. The patient also has CHB s/p PPM and now presents with Group B Strep Endocarditis involving the infected pacemaker and aortic valve. 

The patient has undergone several interventions and consultations, including reconsulting podiatry to assess for osteomyelitis, bone scan, and evaluation of infected pacer leads. The patient's respiratory failure has been resolved, but they may still require additional diuresis. The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss and inflammation. 

The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 has been managed by transitioning to lantus and HISS pre-meal, with an increase in lantus to 10 Units. The patient's septic shock has resolved. 

The patient has bilateral foot ulcers, and a bone scan revealed radiotracer uptake predominantly at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint, which is non-specific. 

The patient's thrombocytopenia has improved. The patient's diet consists of a PO diet with modifications per speech & swallow service, and they are being considered for advancing their diet as per speech and swallow and nursing.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. They also have CHB s/p PPM and are now diagnosed with Group B Strep Endocarditis with an infected pacemaker and aortic valve.

2. The patient's clinical condition has improved and is currently stable on IV antibiotics.

3. Surgery plans are being made for the patient to address the Group B Strep Endocarditis, but prior to going to the operating room, other occult infections need to be ruled out, particularly osteomyelitis.

4. The patient's infected pacer leads pose a challenge for removal due to large vegetations.

5. The patient previously experienced respiratory failure but has resolved and is now on nasal cannula. Weaning off oxygen may require additional diuretics.

6. The patient has anemia likely caused by blood loss and inflammation. The hematocrit (Hct) level has been stable.

7. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed by transitioning to lantus and his mealtime insulin.

8. The patient experienced septic shock but has since resolved.

9. The patient has bilateral foot ulcers, and a bone scan showed non-specific uptake at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint."

   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve - plan is for
   patient to go to surgery although need to rule out osteomyelitis or
   other occult infection prior to going to OR. ID and CV surgery have
   been following. Reconsulted podiatry [**2-14**] to assess for osteomyelitis,
   bone scan only included foot was non-specific.
   - ID consulting. Recs appreciated
 will ask about medication that can
   be dosed less frequently for discharge
   - PICC today
   - podiatry continues to feel there is no active osteo in the foot
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for synergy

   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on room air.  Weaning off of oxygen,
   requires O2 at night for apnea.
   - Appreciate pulm recs
   - Pt with sleep apnea. Improved with NC O2. Will discuss CPAP with Pt
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors.
   Patient got 1 unit of blood on [**2-15**] without appropriate bump. Patient
   with low retic count.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement, and AVR with abscess repair. He has been diagnosed with Group B Strep Endocarditis involving the prosthetic aortic valve. The patient's infected pacemaker leads may be difficult to remove immediately due to large vegetations. He also has respiratory failure that has resolved and is now on room air, requiring O2 at night for sleep apnea. The patient is anemic likely due to blood loss and inflammation. His diabetes mellitus type 2 requires continued management. He experienced septic shock, which has resolved. The patient has bilateral foot ulcers, and a bone scan showed non-specific uptake. There are no signs of osteomyelitis. Thrombocytopenia has improved. The patient is on a PO diet with modifications and has been started on IV antibiotics. He has multiple lines, including an IJ and PICC, for access. The plan is to place the PICC and discharge the IJ. An IR procedure is scheduled for tomorrow. The patient's code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The infection in the prosthetic aortic valve can lead to further complications such as valve dysfunction, embolization of vegetations, or septic emboli.
2. Infected Pacemaker Leads: Difficulties in removing the leads can increase"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. The patient also has CHB s/p PPM and is currently being treated for Group B Strep Endocarditis with an infected pacemaker and aortic valve. 

The patient's current condition is stable, and he is receiving intravenous antibiotics. The plan is to take the patient to surgery, but prior to that, it is necessary to rule out osteomyelitis or other occult infection. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include respiratory failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, septic shock, bilateral foot ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and compromised glycemic control. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, as well as his oxygen saturation levels. Regular assessments of the patient's mental status and overall physical condition should be conducted. Monitoring the patient's blood glucose levels is crucial due to his history of diabetes mellitus type 2. 

Additionally, the patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored, and adjustments made as needed. The patient's fluid balance should also be carefully monitored to prevent any potential complications related to fluid overload or dehydration. 

In terms of the patient's access, the plan is to place a PIC"
