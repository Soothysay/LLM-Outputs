   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and evidence of multilobar pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be minimized by maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing regular mouth care, implementing daily spontaneous breathing trials, and monitoring respiratory system infection parameters.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Critically ill patients have an increased risk of developing blood clots in their legs (DVT), which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a life-threatening PE. Prophylaxis measures such as using compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation should be considered.

3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition may increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can help prevent these complications.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, which can be attributed to steroid use and the stress of critical illness. Monitoring glucose levels and maintaining them below 150 mg/dL with insulin as needed is essential.

5. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, sed"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who is experiencing respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is attributed to a COPD exacerbation with evidence of multilobar pneumonia. The patient also has hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia, sedation, and concern for sepsis. Fluid repletion is being pursued, and empirical antimicrobials have been initiated to address potential infections. The patient is also being monitored for lactic acid levels.

Additionally, the patient has hyperglycemia, likely exacerbated by steroid use. Insulin is being administered as needed to maintain glucose levels below 150 mg/dL. The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is continuing on usual medications for this condition.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeds, glycemic control, and multiple lines for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention strategies such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory system infection (RSBI) monitoring.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary."

The patient presented to the ICU with chief complaints of shortness of breath and hypotension. They were unable to provide a history due to sedation. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, heparin, pantoprazole, and others. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate of 38 bpm (normal range 38-71 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 100/57 mmHg to 82/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (normal range 10-27), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory issues. The patient has been mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, likely caused by a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. There are concerns about community-acquired pneumonia, and the patient is being treated with antibiotics. The patient also has hypotension, which could be due to sedation, positive pressure ventilation, hypovolemia, or sepsis. Fluid support is being provided, and the goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient has fluid balance issues and needs nutritional support. They are also at risk for pulmonary hypertension, hyperglycemia, and schizophrenia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory distress due to a likely COPD flare and multilobar pneumonia (PNA). The patient was successfully extubated today.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to the COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA. It is important to monitor the patient's ABG values and maintain pH levels below 7.35, pO2 levels above 60, and SaO2 levels above 90.

2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has multifocal CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) with cultures currently without growth. It is important to continue the current antibiotics, Vancomycin and Zosyn, and may need to initiate empirical treatment.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient is likely experiencing hyperglycemia, possibly due to steroid use. It is necessary to tighten glycemic control by adjusting the HISS (hypoglycemic insulin-sensitizing substance).

4. Schizophrenia: The patient has a history of schizophrenia, and it is important to continue treatment with Zyprexa.

5. ICU Care: The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and V"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD who presented with hypercarbic respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with a multilobar pneumonia (PNA) and his respiratory status has improved since being placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but his heart rate is on the lower side. His oxygen saturation levels are good. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory distress suggests a potential for respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG) will be necessary to maintain pH < 7.35, pCO2 < 60, and SaO2 > 90.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has multifocal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Cultures are currently without growth, so it is important to continue antibiotics such as Vancomycin and Zosyn. Empirical treatment may be needed if the culture results are delayed or show resistance.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, likely due to steroid use for COPD flare. Tight glycemic control should be maintained through the HISS (hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia investigation, screening, and surveillance) protocol.
4. Schizophrenia: The patient is being treated for schizophrenia with O"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient is suspected to have a multilobar pneumonia (PNA) and a COPD flare-up. He is receiving mechanical ventilation but was successfully extubated today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, heart rate of 38 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.5°C. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure could worsen if the underlying cause, such as the COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA, is not adequately treated. Close monitoring of the patient's ABG values and respiratory support will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a suspected multilobar PNA. If left untreated, the infection can progress and lead to further respiratory distress or even sepsis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and cultures should be monitored for growth.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD flare-up needs to be managed appropriately with bronchodilators and steroids. If not adequately controlled, the exacerbation can lead to persistent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB) and hypotension. They are currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, heparin, and pantoprazole. They are on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 38 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/43 to 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus bradycardia. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and blood products. Their urine output is within normal limits. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, while other parameters are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to the use of sedatives and the ICU"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and evidence of multilobar pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated but is awake and interactive. Bradycardia was observed overnight, but there was no hemodynamic compromise. The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is on medication for it. Other medical conditions include hypotension, which has improved, pulmonary infiltrates suggesting community-acquired pneumonia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation have been implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. However, systemic anticoagulation has not been initiated yet.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of stress ulcers, and prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been started.
4. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has improved, it is important to monitor blood pressure and maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Empirical antimicrobials have been started due to concerns for sepsis.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. They exhibited bradycardia overnight, indicating hemodynamic compromise. The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable but show some abnormalities such as low blood pressure and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a positive balance of 4,378 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 40%. The ABG results indicate a slightly low pH and low oxygen saturation. Physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of abuse. The patient's neurologic examination is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of the bed and ensuring proper hand hygiene.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures like compression stockings or systemic anticoagulation should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD flare-up and multilobar pneumonia. The patient experienced bradycardia overnight, requiring sedation and intubation. There were attempts to extubate the patient but unsuccessful due to inadequate oxygenation, leading to re-intubation. The patient's urine output was low, necessitating a 500 cc bolus. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 14 cmH2O, RR of 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 145. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory failure with a pH of 7.13 and low oxygen levels. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/55 mmHg to 153/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and trace peripheral edema. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient is"

- The patient is a 63-year-old male with COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to COPD flare-up and multilobar pneumonia.
- The patient experienced several medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and schizophrenia.
- The patient was initially intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to persistent acidosis.
- Despite aggressive fluid boluses, the patient appeared euvolemic on examination with elevated central venous pressure (CVP) likely related to pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient's blood glucose levels were elevated, likely due to steroid use.
- Renal function declined, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels from 0.8 to 1.2.
- The patient experienced episodes of hypotension and required vasopressor support.
- Bradycardia was noted, which is likely vasovagal-related and hemodynamically stable.
- The patient's schizophrenia requires ongoing medication management.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications, including Olanzapine for schizophrenia, Solumedrol for COPD flare-up, and antibiotics for pneumonia.
- The patient's nutrition is being provided through a pulmonary diet, and glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale.
- Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia who was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD flare and multilobar pneumonia (PNA). The patient experienced several events overnight, including bradycardia, increased serum sodium levels, extubation to bipap, worsening ABGs, and re-intubation. The patient also received a 500 cc bolus for low urine output. Due to sedation, the patient was unable to provide a history.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory distress, likely caused by a COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA. The patient was successfully extubated but required re-intubation due to worsening ABGs.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Cultures are currently without growth, and the patient is being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn. Empirical treatment may be needed.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient likely has steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Tight glycemic control should be maintained.
4. Schizophrenia: The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is being treated with Zyprexa.
5. ICU Care: The patient requires nutrition support with Nutren Pulmonary, tight glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and require mechanical ventilation due to their poor respiratory status. The patient was extubated yesterday but experienced tenuous respiratory status during the day and required temporary use of BiPAP. However, their condition deteriorated last night, leading to ventilator failure and delirium. They were subsequently reintubated and remain mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 132/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg, and their fluid balance over the past 24 hours is positive with a total input of 3,062 mL and output of 1,263 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 11.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, platelet count of 293 x 10^9/L, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride level of 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 27 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen level of 24 mg/dL, glucose level of 79 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and lactate level"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Required
   re-intubation, mechanical ventilation.  Attributed to COPD
   exacerbation, with evidence for multilobar pneumonia.  Slow progress,
   suspect will require additional support prior to working towards
   extubation.  Limited evidence for auto-PEEP.  Monitor ABG, maintain Ph
   < 7.35, pO2 < 60, SaO2 < 90.
   COPD -- exacerbation.  continue medications, including steroids
   continue iv.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect community acquired pneumonia.
   Multifocal, concerns include usual pyogenic, atypicals (including
   viral).  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENSION -- Improved.  Component of hypovolemia, sedation, but
   concern for sepsis.  Continue support, empirical antimicrobials.  Goal
   MAP >60 mmHg.   Monitor off vasopressor.
   RENAL FAILURE
 suspect related to hypovolemia, sepsis.  Plan to
   provide iv challenge, monitor UO, BUN, creat.  Check UA, urine lytes,
   osmolality.
   SEPSIS
 responding to clinical management.  Continue support.
   FLUIDS --  Repleted.  Monitor I/O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 hold TF.  Advance diet following extubation.
   PULMONARY HTN -- Clinically stable.  Contributing to hypoxemia.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- attributed in part to steroids.  Monitor glucose,
   maintain <150 with insulin prn.
   SCHIZOPHRENIA -- continue usual meds.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to progressive respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory status has been tenuous, and there have been transient uses of BiPAP. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation with evidence of multilobar pneumonia. The patient's hypotension has improved, but there is concern for sepsis. Renal failure is suspected due to hypovolemia and sepsis. The patient's schizophrenia medication should be continued.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 132/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.0, hematocrit of 32.0, platelet count of 293, blood urea nitrogen of 24 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose of 179 mg/dL. Other lab values include normal potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and oriented mental status with purpose"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring invasive ventilation and intubation. The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. They are also hypotensive, with concerns for sepsis. There are indications of renal failure, and the patient is responding to clinical management. Fluid repletion has been achieved, but nutritional support is being held temporarily. The patient has hyperglycemia, likely due to steroid use, and schizophrenia. The patient's ICU care includes pulmonary nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, and they require ongoing mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and the patient may require additional respiratory support before considering extubation.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD has worsened, leading to an exacerbation. Continued medications, including steroids, are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Pulmonary Infiltrates: Suspected community-acquired pneumonia with multifocal infiltrates is present. Empirical antimicrobials should be continued to cover usual pyogenic organisms and atypical pathogens.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved but could be due to hypov"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M w/ COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure due to COPD flare and multilobar PNA.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress,
   likely in setting of COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.  Changes in
   ventilatory settings resulted in appropriate pH/pCO2/pO2 interventions.
   However, patient self extubated yesterday, and was unable to remain on
   bi-pap, requiring re-intubation for the 2^nd time in the past 3 days.
   - check ABGs, maintain Ph < 7.35, pO2 < 60, SaO2 < 90.
   - decrease FiO2 to 0.35% (to )
   - continue Zosyn and  Levofloxacin for PNA, likely will need empiric
   treatment
   - continue Combivent nebs.
   - d/c Solumedrol 40 IV TID, transition to prednisone 40 PO BID for CODP
   flare
   - place arterial line
   Hypotension: Off pressors.
   - IVFs as needed
   Acute renal failure: Cre down to 1.2, baseline 0.8-0.9 Urine
   electrolytes show ARF is likely pre-renal.
   - run Is=Os to slightly positive,
   - renally dose antibiotics
   Bradycardia: hemodynamically stable, likely vasovagal related (occurs
   mostly in sleep).
   - continue telemetry monitoring.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Likely steroid induced. Added NPH (3 U [**Hospital1 **]).
   SCHIZOPHRENIA -- continue Zyprexa.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with schizophrenia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient tolerated changes in ventilator settings to improve hypercarbia but self-extubated at 10 pm and required re-intubation at 1 am due to progressive hypercarbia and agitation. The patient was given haloperidol to treat agitation. Urine electrolytes showed that the kidneys are sodium avid, and a 500 cc normal saline bolus was administered. Vancomycin was discontinued, and the patient is unable to provide history as they are sedated.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory distress, likely in the setting of a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. Changes in ventilatory settings resulted in appropriate pH/pCO2/pO2 interventions, but the patient self-extubated and was unable to remain on bipap, requiring re-intubation for the second time in three days.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive and is currently off pressors. IV fluids are being given as needed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has decreased to 1.2, and urine electrolytes show acute renal failure is likely pre-renal. Isosmotic fluid replacement is being run, and antibiotics are being renally dosed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with schizophrenia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient tolerated changes in ventilator settings but self-extubated at 10 pm and required reintubation due to progressive hypercarbia and agitation. He received a dose of haloperidol to treat agitation. The patient's kidneys are sodium avid, so a 500cc normal saline bolus was administered. Vancomycin was discontinued, and the patient is unable to provide history as he is sedated. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and haloperidol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate hypotension. This can be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which is a pre-existing condition. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function due to the underlying COPD and the current hypercarbic respiratory failure.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head of bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and respiratory system batch interface (RSBI) assessment should"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M w/ COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure due to COPD flaire and multilobar PNA.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress,
   likely in setting of COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.  Continued
   respiratory acidosis after extubation, requring re-intubation (may have
   some component of metabolic acidosis as well, given ARF). Unlikely
   volume overload (did also received aggressive fluid boluses to wean off
   of pressors, but appears euvolemic on exam with elevated CVP likely
   related to pulmonary hypertension, and may be volume contracted, which
   diuresis would worsen).
   - check ABG on C-pap, maintain Ph < 7.35, pO2 < 60, SaO2 < 90.
   - increase tidal volume to 550, decrease FiO2 to 0.35% (to improve
   respiratory acidosis)
   - continue Zosyn and  Levofloxacin for PNA, likely will need empiric
   treatment
   - d/c Vancomycin (2 sputums with oropharyngeal flora on GS only, no
   single organisms).
   - continue Combivent nebs and Solumedrol 40 IV TID for CODP flare
   - continue  steroids for now, re-evaluate taper tomorrow.
   Hypotension: Off pressors.
   - IVFs as needed
   Acute renal failure: Cre up to 1.2, baseline 0.8-0.9. Likely pre-renal
   secondary to hypotension => intra-renal ATN (oliguric this AM).
   - urine sediment, urine electrolytes
   - await post-ATN diuresis
   - run Is=Os.
   - renally dose antibiotics
   Bradycardia: hemodynamically stable, likely vasovagal related (occurs
   mostly in sleep).
   - continue telemetry monitoring.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Likely steroid induced. Added NPH (3 U [**Hospital1 **]).
   SCHIZOPHRENIA -- continue Zyprexa.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with schizophrenia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient tolerated changes in ventilator settings to improve hypercarbia but self-extubated at 10 pm and was unable to remain on bi-pap, requiring re-intubation due to progressive hypercarbia and agitation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient is sedated and intubated. 

The patient's medical history includes COPD and schizophrenia. Allergies are not reported. The patient is currently receiving various medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, lorazepam, heparin sodium, olanzapine, Combivent nebs, haldol, senna, and bisacodyl.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,776 mL and output of 1,290 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,486 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 21 mmHg, with a total fluid input of 2,776 mL and output of 1,290 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD flare and multilobar pneumonia. He has been experiencing respiratory failure, requiring multiple interventions including intubation. The patient also has hypotension, acute renal failure, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and schizophrenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and pneumonia put him at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs, ABGs, and ventilatory settings will be crucial to manage this condition.
2. Fluid Overload: Elevated CVPs indicate potential fluid volume overload. However, the presence of pulmonary hypertension suggests that this is not the case. Regular monitoring of fluid balance and adjusting IVF as needed can help prevent fluid overload.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have decreased from previous values, indicating improvement. However, continued monitoring of urine electrolytes and renal function is necessary to assess and manage acute renal failure.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely vasovagal-related and hemodynamically stable. Telemetry monitoring should continue to monitor heart rhythm and ensure no further complications arise.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels are likely steroid-induced. Continued monitoring and management of glycemic control is essential to prevent complications related to hyperglycemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia who was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory distress, likely in the setting of a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. Previous attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator have been unsuccessful. The goal is to maintain a pH below 7.35, pO2 below 60, and SaO2 below 90.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has signs of pre-renal azotemia, as indicated by U-lytes and a decreasing creatinine level. A 500 cc bolus was given, and the patient will be monitored closely with Is=Os running slightly positive. Antibiotics should be reviewed and adjusted based on the improving creatinine level.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, and the patient has been off pressors for more than 48 hours. IVFs will be given as needed.

4. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, which are likely vasovagal-related and occur mostly during sleep. Telemetry monitoring will continue.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been well-controlled with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has developed hypertension and bradycardia. His renal function has improved, and he is showing signs of improvement in his respiratory status. However, he remains at risk for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and current multilobar pneumonia put him at risk for ongoing respiratory distress and potential failure. Close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs) and respiratory support will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest pre-renal azotemia, possibly due to dehydration or reduced cardiac output. Continued monitoring of renal function, fluid balance, and urine output is essential to prevent further deterioration in renal function.

3. Hypertension: The patient has developed hypertension despite previously being hypotensive. This may be a response to the stress of illness or secondary to steroid use. Close monitoring of blood pressure and consideration of antihypertensive medication may be required.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels are likely related to stress, steroid use,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Required
   re-intubation, mechanical ventilation.  Attributed to COPD
   exacerbation, with evidence for multilobar pneumonia.  Slow progress,
   suspect will require additional support prior to working towards
   extubation.  Limited evidence for auto-PEEP.  Monitor ABG, maintain Ph
   < 7.35, pO2 > 60, SaO2 > 90.
   COPD -- exacerbation.  continue medications, including steroids
   continue iv.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect community acquired pneumonia.
   Multifocal, concerns include usual pyogenic, atypicals (including
   viral).  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to a COPD exacerbation with evidence of multilobar pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 139/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation management.

The patient's review of systems is mostly negative except for the respiratory system, where they have no cough, dyspnea, or wheezing. The physical examination reveals an endotracheal tube in place, normal heart sounds, and symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds bilaterally. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal kidney function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas values indicate a slight respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.38. 

The assessment and plan include the following: 
1. Respiratory failure due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring re-intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. COPD exacerbation with evidence of multilobar pneumonia. 
3. Pulmonary infiltrates suspected to be community-acquired pneumonia. 
4. Hypotension has resolved. 
5. Renal failure has improved and is prerenal in nature.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by a COPD exacerbation with evidence of multilobar pneumonia. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 139/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is on medication for it.

The patient's review of systems is mostly negative except for respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. The physical examination reveals clear lung sounds bilaterally, and the patient has an endotracheal tube in place.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are elevated, but controlled with insulin as needed. Other lab values, including kidney function and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing medications for COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and schizophrenia. They are also receiving nutritional support through tube feeding and glycemic control. Fluids have been repleted, and the patient is being monitored closely for any changes in condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M w/ COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure due to COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress,
   likely in setting of COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.  Required
   intubation x2. More alkalotic today, likely in setting of diuresis.
   - serial ABGs, maintain Ph < 7.35, pO2 < 60, SaO2 < 90.
   - decrease RR to 10 to increase CO2 retention.
   - diuresis with diamox, goal -500 ccs to -1L
   - continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin
   - continue Combivent nebs.
   - decreased prednisoneto 20 PO BID
   -SBT this AM, daily RSBI and wake-up
   .
   # Acute renal failure: U-lytes consistent with pre-renal azotemia. Cre
   down to 1.1, baseline 0.8-0.9.  Was -377 ml in 24 hours.
   - run Is=Os to slightly positive,
   - change levofloxacine dose given improved creatinine
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved, off pressors for >48 hours
   #Bradycardia: hemodynamically stable, likely vasovagal related (occurs
   mostly in sleep).
   - continue telemetry monitoring.
   #Hypertension: Patient with no noted history of hypertension (just
   hypotension). Likey due to hypervolemia from recent fluid
   resusucitation after hypotension.
   -diuresis as above.
   -IV Hydralazine PRN SBP >170
   -EKG and cardiac enzymes
   -no nodal blocking [**Doctor Last Name **] given bradycardia
   -pain control
   #: Leukocytosis: still receiving steroids, although with slight
   temperature today. On broad spectrum antibiotics. Urine appears cloudy
   today. Oldest line is IJ place on [**1-28**], appears non-tender to
   palpation.
   - urine culture.
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Likely [**3-10**] steroids. NPH increased to 10 U [**Hospital1 **].
   # SCHIZOPHRENIA -- continue Zyprexa and PRN haldol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia who was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory distress due to a multilobar pneumonia and COPD flare. The patient required intubation twice and is currently sedated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure of 118/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and a plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and multilobar pneumonia increase the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal azotemia. Monitoring fluid balance, daily weights, and electrolyte levels is crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has resolved,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory distress caused by multilobar pneumonia and a flare-up of COPD. The patient's condition has been complicated by the identification of MRSA in the sputum, resulting in the initiation of Vancomycin therapy. The patient also has hypertension that has not responded to IV hydralazine, leading to the administration of Lasix. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and is sedated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and perform regular cultures to detect any potential infections.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI): Given the patient's prolonged hospital stay and the presence of central venous lines, there is a risk of developing a nosocomial BSI. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and prompt investigation of any suspected infections is crucial.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation are recommended.

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress,
   likely in setting of COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.  Required
   intubation x2. More alkalotic today, likely in setting of diuresis.
   - serial ABGs, maintain Ph < 7.35, pO2 < 60, SaO2 < 90.
   - decrease RR to 10 to increase CO2 retention.
   - diuresis with diamox, goal -500 ccs to -1L

   - d/c Levofloxacin
   - continue Combivent nebs.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 63 yo M with copd on home O2, secondary pHTN,
   schizophrenia admitted with hypercarbic resp failure in setting of copd
   exac and pna. Has failed extubation X 2. Overnight became apneic during
   SBT.  Sedation decreased.  Hypertensive with hydral and lasix given.
   Sputum now growing GPC (MRSA) with vanco restarted.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.4 BP 118/57  HR 52 RR  with sat on ACV
   500/14/5/30% --> 7.47/51/72.
   Intubated and sedated, CTA anteriorly, distant BS, rr distant HS, NABS,
   soft, trace pitting dependent edema
   Labs notable for WBC 14.3 (10.7) K, HCT 35.2, 140 na, 4.1 K+, serum CO2
   38, Cr 1.1, lactate 1.2.
   CXR with lines, et ok, pulm infiltrates improved overall, unchanged c/t
   yesterday, full hilar vessels
   Primary issues remain:
     * Resp failure
     * Pna
     * COPD
     * resp alkalosis and chronic CO2 retention
     * Volume overload
     * leukocytosis
     * HOTN--> now with htn
     * Hyperglycemia
     * schizophrenia
   Acid base status, sedation, and volume seem to be main issues
   preventing extubation.
   Agree with plan to optimize acid base status (correct alkalosis) by
   decreasing RR to 10 and following abgs. Diuresis likely contributing to
   met alkalosis and in setting of chronic CO2 retention this may
   contribute to low resp drive and failure to wean.  Continue MDIs. Taper
   prednisone to 20 today.  Now with MRSA in sputum--no other bacterial cx
   pos.  Will d/c levoflox and continue vanco/zosyn, consider d/c zosyn
   after 1 additional day.   Aim to maintain baseline CO2 elevation with
   compensated ph to assist with wean.  Continue to follow i/o's with goal
   neg fluid balance--give lasix/diamox to maintain net neg balance as
   needed.  HOTN resolved and actually hypertensive last night which

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia. He was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory distress due to a COPD flare and multilobar pneumonia (PNA). The patient required intubation twice and has been sedated.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, bradycardia, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and schizophrenia. His arterial blood gases (ABGs) show a pH of 7.47, which indicates respiratory alkalosis. His PaCO2 is 51, indicating hypercapnia. His SaO2 is 93%, and his oxygen saturation is maintained at 30% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, indicating an infection. His creatinine levels have improved from 1.2 to 1.1 mg/dL. His blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates, consistent with PNA. His echocardiogram (EKG) is unchanged, and his cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's current plan includes continuing Zosyn and Vancomycin for MRSA in the sputum. Levofloxacin will be discontinued. Combivent nebs will be continued, and prednisone will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M w/ COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure due to COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress,
   likely in setting of COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.  Required
   intubation x2. More alkalotic today, likely in setting of diuresis.
   - serial ABGs, maintain Ph < 7.35, pO2 < 60, SaO2 < 90.
   - decrease RR to 10 to increase CO2 retention.
   - diuresis with diamox, goal -500 ccs to -1L
   - continue Zosyn, Vancomycin
   - d/c Levofloxacin
   - continue Combivent nebs.
   - decreased prednisoneto 20 PO BID
   -SBT this AM, daily RSBI and wake-up
   .
   # Acute renal failure: U-lytes consistent with pre-renal azotemia. Cre
   down to 1.1, baseline 0.8-0.9.  Was -377 ml in 24 hours.  [**Month (only) 60**] have had
   a component of ATN with autodiuresis currently.
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved, off pressors for >48 hours
   #Bradycardia: hemodynamically stable, likely vasovagal related (occurs
   mostly in sleep).
   - continue telemetry monitoring.
   #Hypertension: Patient with no noted history of hypertension (just
   hypotension). Likey due to hypervolemia from recent fluid
   resusucitation after hypotension.
   -diuresis as above.
   -IV Hydralazine PRN SBP >170
   -EKG and cardiac enzymes
   -no nodal blocking [**Doctor Last Name **] given bradycardia
   -pain control
   #: Leukocytosis: still receiving steroids, although with slight
   temperature today. On broad spectrum antibiotics. Urine appears cloudy
   today. Oldest line is IJ place on [**1-28**], appears non-tender to
   palpation.
   - urine culture.
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Likely [**3-10**] steroids. NPH increased to 10 U [**Hospital1 **].
   # SCHIZOPHRENIA -- continue Zyprexa and PRN haldol.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. The patient required intubation twice and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/57 to 152/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient has a sinus bradycardia rhythm and a central venous pressure of 15 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Kidney function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels. Electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes, and blood glucose are within normal limits.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory distress, likely due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. The goal is to maintain pH < 7.35, pO2 < 60, and SaO2 > 90. The respiratory rate should be decreased to 10 breaths per minute to increase CO2 retention. Diuresis with diamox is recommended, aiming for a"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M w/ COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure due to COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress,
   likely in setting of COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.  Required
   intubation x2. Respiratory alkalosis improved with increased RR on vent
   settings.
   - serial ABGs, maintain Ph < 7.35, pO2 < 60, SaO2 < 90.
   - continue current vent settings (RR 10)
   - diuresis with IV diamox, goal -1L
   - continue Vancomycin (day 7, but was off for 2 days, so day 5 => needs
   minimum 8 days course)
   - d/c Zosyn
   - continue Combivent nebs.
   - cont prednisoneto 20 PO BID, consider taper tomorrow to 10 [**Hospital1 **] if
   less expiratory wheezes
   -SBT tomorrow AM, daily RSBI and wake-up

   # Acute renal failure: U-lytes consistent with pre-renal azotemia. Cre
   down to 1.2, baseline 0.8-0.9.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have had a component of ATN with autodiuresis currently.  Diuresis
   as above with PM lytes.
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved, off pressors for >48 hours
   #Bradycardia: hemodynamically stable, likely vasovagal related (occurs
   mostly in sleep).
   - continue telemetry monitoring.
   #Hypertension: Patient with no noted history of hypertension (just
   hypotension). Usually associated with agitation, although is volume
   overloaded on exam. Must control hypertension prior to extubation, as
   may worsen with removal of PPV and resulting increased preload +
   agitation of extubation.
   -diuresis as above.
   -IV Hydralazine q6H for  SBP >170 (no labetolol given hx of COPD).
   -no nodal blocking [**Doctor Last Name **] given bradycardia

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 63 yo M with copd on home O2, secondary pHTN,
   schizophrenia admitted with hypercarbic resp failure in setting of copd
   exac and pna. Has failed extubation X 2.
   Overnight remained on ACV.  Held on additional diuresis.  Insulin
   regimen increased with improved BS control.

   trace pitting dependent edema

   Cr 1.2
   CXR with lines, et ok, pulm infiltrates improved overall, unchanged c/t
   yesterday, continues to have full hilar vessels
   Primary issues remain:
     * Resp failure
     * Pna
     * COPD
     * resp alkalosis and chronic CO2 retention
     * Volume overload
     * leukocytosis
     * HOTN--> now with htn
     * Hyperglycemia
     * schizophrenia
   Acid base status, sedation and agitation, and volume seem to be main
   issues preventing extubation.
   Agree with plan to continue to optimize acid base status--am abg
   improved from prior with CO2 57 (closer to pt's baseline, less
   alkalotic).  Continues to have volume overload on imaging and met
   alkalosis as well as htn which are all further contributing to his
   difficulty tolerating extubation.  Will trial diamox fro met
   alk.  Start standing hydral and gentle sedation to improve BPs.
   Slightly wheezy on exam--will hold at prednisone at 20 today and
   continue MDIs. SBT in am and will likely need extubation to noninvasive
   ventilation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be heading toward trach. Leukocytosis trending down
   and remains af (on steroids)-->+ MRSA in sputum--no other bacterial cx
   pos.  Will d/c zosyn today and continue 8 day course of
   vanco. Secretions are better.  Continue to follow i/o's with goal neg
   fluid balance--give lasix/diamox to maintain net neg balance as
   needed.  Hyperglycemia under improved control--continuing NPH and SSI.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with COPD and schizophrenia.
- He was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia.
- The patient required intubation twice, and his respiratory alkalosis improved with increased respiratory rate on the ventilator.
- Current issues include respiratory failure, pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, hyperglycemia, volume overload, hypertension, and schizophrenia.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute.
- His blood glucose levels are being controlled with regular insulin sliding scale.
- The patient's leukocytosis is resolving with tapered steroids, and he is on Vancomycin.
- He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, with improving creatinine levels.
- The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled prior to extubation.
- The patient's schizophrenia will continue to be managed with Zyprexa and PRN Haldol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, which requires ongoing management with mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, which needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics and may require additional interventions.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation is contributing to his respiratory failure and requires careful management with bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
4. Hyperglycemia:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with COPD and schizophrenia who is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may worsen if there is a further decline in respiratory function, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's U-lytes suggest pre-renal azotemia, and there has been a decrease in creatinine levels. However, there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with ongoing autodiuresis. Monitoring kidney function and continuing diuresis as needed will be important.
3. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved and they are off pressors, monitoring blood pressure closely is essential to prevent any further drops.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely vasovagal-related and hemodynamically stable. Telemetry monitoring should continue to monitor heart rate and rhythm.
5. Hypertension: The patient has developed hypertension, which may be associated with volume overload. Diuresis and IV hydralazine may be necessary to manage this condition.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is resolving with tapered steroids. Continued"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with COPD and schizophrenia who is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation indicate an increased risk of respiratory failure. Monitoring ABGs, maintaining pH, pO2, and SaO2 levels, and adjusting ventilator settings will be important to prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels, suggesting acute renal failure. Pre-renal azotemia is indicated by the U-lytes. The patient's previous history of autodiuresis suggests a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Diuresis and fluid management will be crucial in managing this condition.

3. Hypotension and Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which have resolved but require ongoing monitoring. Bradycardia is also noted, which may be vasovagal-related but needs to be monitored, especially during sleep.

4. Hypertension: The patient has developed hypertension, which may be due to volume overload. It is important to control hypertension prior to extubation as it may worsen with the removal of positive pressure ventilation (PPV).

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is resolving with tapered steroids. Vancomycin has been started, and there are no fevers. The oldest line in the patient's femoral vein appears non-tender, and the urinalysis shows trace leukocytes and bacteria, with negative nitrites. Following up with a urine culture is essential.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, likely due to steroids. Continuing NPH insulin and monitoring glycemic control is important.

7. Schizophrenia: The patient has schizophrenia, and medications such as Zyprexa and PRN haldol should be continued to manage psychiatric symptoms.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia who is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory distress. The patient's ABG results show alkalosis with a decreased respiratory rate of 10. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 14, and urine culture and urinalysis have been sent. There has been no diuresis given due to alkalosis yesterday, with an intake/output balance of +300ccs this morning. The patient's NPH has been increased to 10 units.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: The elevated leukocyte count suggests a potential infection, which could be related to the patient's compromised immune system due to schizophrenia medications.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, indicating a risk of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess intake of 2,479 mL with an output of 1,970 mL, indicating a potential fluid overload.
5. Medication Side Effects: The patient is on multiple medications, including prednisone, Haldol, Ativan, Olanzapine, and insulin, which can have their own side effects and drug interactions.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurologic status is currently not assessed, which raises concerns about the potential for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with COPD and schizophrenia who was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. He required intubation twice and his pulmonary status appears improved with treatment of respiratory alkalosis, antibiotics for pneumonia, and diuresis to remove excess fluid. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, hypertension, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and schizophrenia. The plan includes maintaining appropriate ABG values, continuing diuresis, administering antibiotics, weaning sedation and attempting spontaneous breathing trials, discussing the possibility of tracheostomy if extubation fails, and managing other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as indicated by his hypercarbic respiratory failure and the need for intubation. Continued monitoring and management of ABG values are crucial to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of pre-renal azotemia, which may progress to acute renal failure if not properly managed. Diuretics and careful fluid balance are important in preventing worsening renal function.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension could indicate a risk for further episodes. Close monitoring and appropriate management, including diuretics and vasopressors if needed, are important to maintain adequate"

His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 118/57 mmHg, heart rate of 57 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.34, pCO2 of 45 mmHg, and SaO2 of 90%. His lab results indicate some abnormalities, including leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.3 K/uL, elevated serum creatinine levels, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, hypotension, and hyperglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. If not properly managed, there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's lab results indicate signs of pre-renal azotemia, which could progress to acute renal failure if not addressed promptly. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid management are crucial.
3. Hypertension and Hypotension: The patient has both hypertension and hypotension. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to end-organ damage, while uncontrolled hypotension can result in inadequate organ perfusion. It is essential to carefully manage these blood pressure fluctuations to prevent complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and other complications. Insulin therapy should be continued to maintain tight control of blood sugar levels.
5. Schizophrenia: The patient has a history of schizophrenia, and his current medications include Zyprexa and PRN haldol. It is important to continue these medications to manage his psychiatric symptoms.

In summary, the patient is at risk for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, hypotension, and hyperglycemia. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these conditions are necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo M w/ COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure due to COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress, likely in setting of
   COPD exacerbation and MRSA PNA.  Required intubation x2. Patient
   pulmonary status appears improved (less wheezing, ABG at goal) with
   treatment of respiratory alkalosis with decreased RR, antibiotics
   treatment of PNA, and removal of fluid with diuresis (-2.6 L yesterday
   with diamox). Patient was restarted on his home advair and spiriva
   yesterday; however, appears to be unable to appropriately use the
   medications despite education and coaching from respiratory therapist.
   - No need to continue diuresis
   - Last day of Vancomycin (day [**9-14**])
   - Continue Combivent nebs
   - Continue prednisone 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # BRADYCARDIA:
   Hemodynamically stable, likely vasovagal related (occurs mostly in
   sleep).
   - continue telemetry monitoring.
   # HYPERTENSION:
   Patient with no noted history of hypertension (just hypotension).
   Usually associated with agitation, although is volume overloaded on
   exam. Hypertension at time of extubation, was controlled with diuresis
   and a nitro drip which is now off with cuff pressures of 110s to 130s.
   - Continue PO hydralazine
   - Remove A-line
   #: LEUKOCYTOSIS:
   Continues to be elevated, likely partially due to steroids, though
   would not expect to be increasing in this setting. On day [**9-14**] of
   Vancomycin. No fevers. All urine and blood cultures and negative with
   no growth on final reads.
   - Remove A-line
   - Remove RIJ line if peripheral access can be obtained
   - C.diff toxin assay
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA / HYPOGLYCEMIA:
   Hyperglycemia was likely secondary to steroids and thus patient was put
   on NPH [**Hospital1 **]. Overnight and this AM had episodes of hypoglycemia.
   - Given reduction in steroid dosing, can likely discontinue insulin
   sliding scale
   # SCHIZOPHRENIA -- continue Zyprexa and PRN haldol.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved with treatment of respiratory alkalosis, antibiotics for pneumonia, and diuresis to remove excess fluid. However, the patient is unable to appropriately use his home medications (Advair and Spiriva) despite education and coaching from a respiratory therapist.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory distress. Although his pulmonary status has improved, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the patient does not learn to properly use his home medications.

2. Hypertension: The patient had hypertension at the time of extubation, which was controlled with diuresis and a nitro drip. The patient's current blood pressure is in the 110s to 130s range, but it is important to monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent any complications associated with high blood pressure.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, likely vasovagal-related, occurring mostly during sleep. Telemetry monitoring should be continued to monitor the patient's heart rhythm.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count remains elevated, likely due to steroids. It is important to monitor the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), schizophrenia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure admitted for COPD exacerbation and multi-lobar pneumonia. The patient required intubation twice and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. The patient's pulmonary status has improved with treatment of respiratory alkalosis, antibiotics for pneumonia, and diuresis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are some potential medical complications that can arise, such as respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and pneumonia, which can lead to chronic respiratory failure. The patient's ABG results show an ongoing respiratory alkalosis, indicating the need for continued monitoring and treatment.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's U-lytes suggest pre-renal azotemia, and his creatinine level has returned to baseline. Diuresis is being continued with PM lytes.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but it needs to be monitored and controlled before extubation to prevent worsening due to increased preload and agitation.
4. Hypertension: The patient has no known history of hypertension but is currently volume overloaded. Hypertension needs to be controlled prior to extubation to prevent"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   63 yo M w/ COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure due to COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress, likely in setting of
   COPD exacerbation and MRSA PNA.  Required intubation x2. Successfully
   extubated [**2-5**]. Patient was restarted on his home advair yesterday;
   however, appears to be unable to appropriately use the medications
   despite education and coaching from respiratory therapist. Also on
   albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - No need to continue diuresisat this time
   - Finished 8 day course Vancomycin
   - Continue Albuterol/ ipratropom nebs
   - Continue prednisone 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]  for now- pt unable to properly take
   inhaled steroids
   # BRADYCARDIA:
   Hemodynamically stable, likely vasovagal related (occurs mostly in
   sleep).
   - continue telemetry monitoring.
   # HYPERTENSION:
   Patient with no noted history of hypertension (just hypotension).
   Usually associated with agitation. Hypertension at time of extubation,
   was controlled with diuresis and a nitro drip which is now off with
   cuff pressures normotensive. A line removed yesterday.
   - Continue PO hydralazine
 uptitrated to 25mg Q 8hrs today
    #: LEUKOCYTOSIS:
   Continues to increase, likely partially due to steroids, though would
   not expect to be increasing in this setting. No fevers. All urine and
   blood cultures and negative with no growth on final reads.
   -rpt UA and Urine Cx, CXR
   - C.diff toxin assay
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA / HYPOGLYCEMIA:

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and schizophrenia. He was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. The patient required intubation twice and was successfully extubated on [**2-5**]. He is currently on albuterol and ipratropium nebs, prednisone, and hydralazine for hypertension.

The patient's leukocytosis continues to increase, likely partially due to steroids. No fevers are present, and all urine and blood cultures are negative. A repeat urine analysis, urine culture, chest X-ray, and C.diff toxin assay are planned.

The patient's blood sugar was initially elevated but is now well-controlled and off insulin. His glycemic control is maintained with NPH insulin.

The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is currently on Zyprexa and PRN haldol.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/75 mmHg to 163/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus rhythm.

The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function. Other labs"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   63 yo M w/ COPD and schizophrenia admitted for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure due to COPD exacerbation and multilobar PNA.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
   Patient with hypercarbic respiratory distress, likely in setting of
   COPD exacerbation and MRSA PNA.  Required intubation x2. Patient
   pulmonary status appears improved (less wheezing, ABG at goal) with
   treatment of respiratory alkalosis with decreased RR, antibiotics
   treatment of PNA, and removal of fluid with diuresis (-2.6 L yesterday
   with diamox). Patient was restarted on his home advair and spiriva
   yesterday; however, appears to be unable to appropriately use the
   medications despite education and coaching from respiratory therapist.
   - No need to continue diuresis
   - Last day of Vancomycin (day [**9-14**])
   - Continue Combivent nebs
   - Continue prednisone 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # BRADYCARDIA:
   Hemodynamically stable, likely vasovagal related (occurs mostly in
   sleep).
   - continue telemetry monitoring.
   # HYPERTENSION:
   Patient with no noted history of hypertension (just hypotension).
   Usually associated with agitation, although is volume overloaded on
   exam. Hypertension at time of extubation, was controlled with diuresis
   and a nitro drip which is now off with cuff pressures of 110s to 130s.
   - Continue PO hydralazine
   - Remove A-line
    #: LEUKOCYTOSIS:
   Continues to be elevated, likely partially due to steroids, though
   would not expect to be increasing in this setting. On day [**9-14**] of
   Vancomycin. No fevers. All urine and blood cultures and negative with
   no growth on final reads.
   - Remove A-line
   - Remove RIJ line if peripheral access can be obtained
   - C.diff toxin assay
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA / HYPOGLYCEMIA:
   Hyperglycemia was likely secondary to steroids and thus patient was put
   on NPH [**Hospital1 **]. Overnight and this AM had episodes of hypoglycemia.
   - Given reduction in steroid dosing, can likely discontinue insulin
   sliding scale
   # SCHIZOPHRENIA -- continue Zyprexa and PRN haldol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and schizophrenia admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation and multilobar pneumonia. The patient required intubation twice and is currently extubated. His pulmonary status appears improved with treatment of respiratory alkalosis, antibiotics for pneumonia, and removal of fluid through diuresis. The patient was restarted on his home medications, Advair and Spiriva, but seems unable to use them appropriately. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and a history of COPD exacerbation with multilobar pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying causes are not adequately addressed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by MRSA. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia if the infection is not effectively treated.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that was initially controlled with diuresis and a nitro drip. It is important to monitor blood pressure regularly and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent leukocytosis, which may be due to steroids. Regular monitoring of white blood cell count is necessary to ensure there are no signs of infection.
5. Hyperglycemia/Hypoglycemia: The patient had episodes of hyperglycemia"
