   IMAGING:
   [**2183-4-16**] CT TORSO:
   1. No acute intrathoracic or intraabdominal process.
   2. Status post right upper and right middle lobectomies with
   corresponding
   chest wall deformity. Small areas of loculated fluid noted at the right
   lung
   apex. Small left-sided pleural effusion.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   [**2183-4-17**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinned inferolateral and
   inferior wall akinesis/dyskinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
   25 %). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An eccentric,
   posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild to
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
   leaflets are thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   promient fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-10-17**], the
   severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation has increased. Regional
   left ventricular systolic function may be slightly worse. No
   vegetations identified. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal
   echocardiographic examination is recommended to evaluate for
   endocarditis.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG presenting with progressive shortness of breath, hypotension, and requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was transferred to [Hospital1] for further management.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient shows signs consistent with septic shock, including fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis. Blood cultures positive for S. aureus suggest a possible source of infection in the pulmonary system. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and the plan is to narrow the regimen based on culture sensitivities.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to volume overload, underlying COPD, and sedation. Diuretics will be initiated as the blood pressure allows, and weaning off pressors will be done. Sedation will be gradually reduced, and repeated spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) will be performed after diuresis.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine levels were elevated, but there has been improvement from 2.3 at OSH to the current level of 1.0. ARF is likely related to hypotension in the setting of sepsis. Medications will be adjusted to improved renal function dosing.

4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of recent hospitalization for COP"

   1. No acute intrathoracic or intraabdominal process.
   2. Status post right upper and right middle lobectomies with
   corresponding
   chest wall deformity. Small areas of loculated fluid noted at the right
   lung
   apex. Small left-sided pleural effusion.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   [**2183-4-17**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinned inferolateral and
   inferior wall akinesis/dyskinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
   25 %). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An eccentric,
   posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild to
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
   leaflets are thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   promient fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-10-17**], the
   severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation has increased. Regional
   left ventricular systolic function may be slightly worse. No
   vegetations identified. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal
   echocardiographic examination is recommended to evaluate for
   endocarditis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypotension. He has a history of atrial flutter, cellulitis, acute renal failure, other cardiomyopathy, septic shock, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. He has been receiving multiple medications including amiodarone, norepinephrine, midazolam, heparin sodium, and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 103/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 28 mmHg and fluid balance with an input of 8,855 mL and output of 1,630 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 430 mL, respiratory system compliance of 25.3 cmH2O/mL, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2 of 363 mmHg, and HCO3- of 24 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant findings.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI): The patient is at risk for developing a BSI due to the presence of multiple central lines and catheters.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest can increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to PE.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged pressure on bony prominences from immobility can lead to pressure ulcers.
5. Catheter-related urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urinary catheter increases the risk of developing a UTI.
6. Delirium: Prolonged sedation and ICU stay can lead to delirium.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient already has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further organ dysfunction, such as liver or cardiac dysfunction.

   2. Status post right upper and right middle lobectomies with
   corresponding
   chest wall deformity. Small areas of loculated fluid noted at the right
   lung
   apex. Small left-sided pleural effusion.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   [**2183-4-17**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinned inferolateral and
   inferior wall akinesis/dyskinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
   25 %). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An eccentric,
   posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild to
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
   leaflets are thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   promient fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-10-17**], the
   severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation has increased. Regional
   left ventricular systolic function may be slightly worse. No
   vegetations identified. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal
   echocardiographic examination is recommended to evaluate for
   endocarditis.

   ## Septic Shock: Fever, hypotension, leukocytosis consistent with
   septic shock. Sources include pulmonary though left lower lobe opacity
   not clearly PNA. UA appears benign. Blood culture from OSH positive for
   S. aureus 4/4 bottles. Femoral line removed and CVL placed.  Patient
   restarted on low dose levophed last night due to suboptimal MAPs which
   now are being titrated.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has a history of COPD, CAD, s/p CABG, and was admitted to the ICU due to progressive shortness of breath and hypotension requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors.

The patient's current condition includes septic shock with positive blood culture for S. aureus, respiratory failure due to volume overload, underlying COPD, and sedation, acute renal failure likely related to hypotension in the setting of sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and a history of ventricular tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a common complication in critically ill patients, especially those with underlying lung disease like COPD.

2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and is currently on amiodarone. The use of amiodarone can have potential side effects such as QT prolongation and hypotension.

3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, which can be caused by hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications. This condition requires careful monitoring and management.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by underlying COPD, sedation,"

   [**2183-4-17**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinned inferolateral and
   inferior wall akinesis/dyskinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
   25 %). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An eccentric,
   posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild to
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
   leaflets are thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   promient fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-10-17**], the
   severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation has increased. Regional
   left ventricular systolic function may be slightly worse. No
   vegetations identified. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal
   echocardiographic examination is recommended to evaluate for
   endocarditis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG. He presented with progressive shortness of breath and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including septic shock, acute renal failure, other cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, atrial flutter, cellulitis, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 103/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin T levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's medical plan includes weaning off pressors, monitoring cardiac output with Vigileo, IVF boluses, goal CVP 8-12, empiric antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia, and monitoring central venous saturation. The patient's renal function is improving, and medications will be adjusted accordingly. The patient will also continue to receive treatment for COPD, atrial fibrillation, and any potential demand ischemia. Additionally, the patient's wrist cellulitis is being monitored, and the patient's an"

   1. No acute intrathoracic or intraabdominal process.
   2. Status post right upper and right middle lobectomies with
   corresponding
   chest wall deformity. Small areas of loculated fluid noted at the right
   lung
   apex. Small left-sided pleural effusion.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   [**2183-4-17**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinned inferolateral and
   inferior wall akinesis/dyskinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
   25 %). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An eccentric,
   posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild to
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
   leaflets are thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   promient fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-10-17**], the
   severity of mitral and aortic regurgitation has increased. Regional
   left ventricular systolic function may be slightly worse. No
   vegetations identified. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal
   echocardiographic examination is recommended to evaluate for
   endocarditis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG presenting with progressive shortness of breath and hypotension. He required rapid intubation and vasopressors and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and unable to provide history. He has multiple comorbidities including atrial flutter, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, septic shock, respiratory failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and a history of ventricular tachycardia. The patient's recent hospitalization was for a COPD exacerbation, and he is finishing a prednisone taper. He is also on long-term outpatient medications for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has signs consistent with septic shock, including fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis. He has been started on empiric antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia and is being closely monitored for improvement.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.2, which has improved from 2.3 at the outside hospital. This suggests potential improvement in renal function. However, the patient still requires adjustment of medications based on improved renal function dosing.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's recent hospitalization was"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG presenting with progressive shortness of breath and hypotension. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock related to Staph Aureus bacteremia, respiratory failure due to volume overload, acute renal failure, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Infection: The patient is currently dealing with a Staph Aureus bacteremia and has a history of cellulitis. There is a possibility of developing further infections, especially if the source of infection is not properly identified and treated.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can worsen if not managed appropriately. Extubation may be considered if the patient shows improvement, but there is a risk of post-extubation complications.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.2, and it has increased to 1.3. This indicates a decline in kidney function, which could be due to septic shock or other underlying causes. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration in kidney function.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, CAD, and previous CABG. His current rhythm is paced sinus, and he required amiodar"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath, hypotension, and required rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient was transferred to Hospital1 for further management. 

Key Findings:
- Positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus.
- Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) without evidence of endocarditis.
- Tube feeding started.
- Electrolyte imbalances (elevated potassium, low sodium).
- Renal failure, acute (baseline creatinine 1.2, currently 1.3).
- Septic shock related to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
- Respiratory failure, currently volume overloaded.
- History of COPD exacerbation and recent hospitalization.
- Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (AFLUTTER).
- Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 99).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's condition is complicated by septic shock due to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This requires aggressive management with antibiotics and supportive care.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
- He presented with progressive shortness of breath, hypotension, and required rapid intubation and vasopressors.
- The patient was transferred to Hospital 1 for further management.
- Initial assessments included atrial flutter, cellulitis, acute renal failure, other cardiomyopathy, septic shock, and acute respiratory failure.
- The patient had positive blood cultures for MRSA bacteremia.
- Treatment plans included continuing vancomycin and cefepime, obtaining OSH cultures, and discussing neck pain further.
- The patient was volume overloaded, and diuresis with lasix was initiated.
- An SBT was performed, and if successful, extubation may be attempted with the use of BiPAP.
- The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.2, which increased to 1.3 after diuresis. Diuresis of -500 mL was attempted today.
- The patient has a history of recent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and is currently on a prednisone taper.
- Medications include ipratropium nebs Q6, albuterol nebs Q4:PRN, prednisone 40 mg po daily (to be decreased to 30 mg on [**4-20**]), amiodarone 400 mg po daily, and digoxin at home dose 125mcg MWF.
- The patient also has thrush, for which fluconazole is prescribed.
- The patient has a history of CAD and s/p CABG.
- Thrombocytopenia is present, with a baseline platelet count of 200 and a current count of 99.
- The patient has hypertension, and outpatient anti-hypertensive medications are being held.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently volume overloaded and has acute respiratory failure. If not managed properly, this could lead to worsening respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.2, which has increased to 1.3. If proper management of fluids and medications is not implemented, there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.

3. Sepsis: The patient has MRSA bacteremia, which could lead to sepsis if not adequately treated. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent sepsis progression.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has other cardiomyopathy, which could worsen if not managed appropriately. This may require careful monitoring of cardiac function and consideration of additional interventions.

5. Thrombocytopen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient was diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and pneumonia (MRSA PNA). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has an ongoing infection with MRSA bacteremia and MRSA PNA, which can lead to sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to multifactorial causes such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). This condition impairs the ability of the lungs to provide enough oxygen to the body and remove carbon dioxide.

3. ICU Delirium: The patient is exhibiting signs of ICU delirium, which is a form of acute mental confusion that can occur in critically ill patients. Infections and underlying dementia may be contributing factors in this case.

4. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis, which is a bacterial"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia, which is likely contributing to their hypercarbic respiratory failure. They require BiPAP and aggressive pulmonary toilet to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis related to MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. Cultures have been obtained, and vancomycin therapy will be continued. Close monitoring of hemodynamics is necessary to ensure stability.

3. ICU Delirium: The patient is experiencing ICU delirium, which may be due to infection and underlying dementia. Haldol is being given as a standing medication to manage agitation, and the QTc interval should be followed.

4. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis that is being treated with vancomycin.

5. Pain with Swallowing: The patient has pain with swallowing, and a failed swallow study suggests possible esophageal involvement. ENT evaluation is planned, and flucanazole is being started for presumed Candida esophagitis. TPN is initiated to provide nutrition.

6. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation, and current management includes ipratropium nebs Q6, albuterol nebs Q4:PRN, and continued prednisone 40mg daily.

7. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (Afib w/ RVR): The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and rapid tachycardias are occurring intermittently. Amiodarone has been changed to IV due to trouble with swallowing, and diltiazem may be used if amiodarone is ineffective. The digoxin dose should be decreased, and the patient should be monitored for renal function.

8. Thrush: The patient is presumed to have esophagitis and oral thrush, for which flucanazole and magic mouthwash are being started.

9. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), post Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG): No active issues are currently reported related to the patient's CAD or CABG history.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and make appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan based on their response and any new developments."

   Hilar vessels appear slightly more engorged and indistinct, and
   subtle areas of perihilar haziness have developed suggesting
   interstitial
   edema. Patchy left retrocardiac opacity is unchanged since recent
   radiographs, and areas of linear opacity in the left mid and lower lung
   are
   also similar as well as a small left pleural effusion and pleural
   thickening.
   Postoperative changes in the right hemithorax are unchanged.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, AS, and previous surgeries such as right upper lobe lobectomy and CABG. He presents with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia and is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia on top of COPD. The patient also has delirium, difficulty swallowing, agitation, and atrial tachycardia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and MRSA pneumonia may lead to worsening respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management with BiPAP support are necessary.

2. Agitation/delirium: The patient's ICU delirium needs to be managed with standing haloperidol and PRN zydis. A psych consult may also be required.

3. Oral pain/dysphagia: The patient's difficulty swallowing should be evaluated by SLP. NPO status and consideration for TPN for nutrition should be considered due to the possibility of esophageal thrush.

4. Atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia: The patient's atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia needs to be managed with increased amiodarone, restarted digoxin, serial EKG monitoring for QTc, and close monitoring of volume status.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple ongoing medical issues requiring careful management and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, AS, and previous surgeries including right upper lobe lobectomy and CABG. He presented with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia on top of COPD, which is requiring bipap support. He also has delirium and agitation, for which he is receiving haloperidol and neurontin. The patient has difficulty swallowing and is at risk of severe aspiration. He has a history of thrush and traumatic TEE. He had an episode of atrial tachycardia, which was managed with lasix, biPAP, and diltiazem. The patient's medications include amiodarone, digoxin, furosemide, pantoprazole, heparin, prednisone, nystatin, insulin, synthroid, plavix, rosuvastatin, ASA, and atracurium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and current MRSA pneumonia put him at risk for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The use of bipap may help alleviate this complication.
2. Agitation/Delirium: The patient's ICU delirium and hypercarbic respiratory failure contribute to his agitation. Continued standing zydis+ PRN and a psychiatric consult may be necessary to manage this condition"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 90-135/50-60 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm (90-155 bpm), respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (17-37 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is paced and he is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures are positive for MRSA bacteremia.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild agitation, posterior pharyngeal erythema, rhonchorous breath sounds in the left lower lobe, warm and dry skin, and weak muscle tone.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has MRSA pneumonia on top of COPD, which can lead to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient requires BiPAP support and should continue vancomycin with levels monitored between 15-20."

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as pneumonia, COPD, and CHF. If not adequately treated, the respiratory failure may progress, leading to hypoxemia and acidosis.

3. ICU Delirium: The patient is experiencing ICU delirium, which can be caused by infection, underlying dementia, and other factors. If not addressed appropriately, delirium can increase the risk of complications, such as falls, pressure ulcers, and infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and hypotension. He required rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia and is currently in the ICU for further management. He has multiple medical complications including sepsis, hypercarbic respiratory failure, ICU delirium, cellulitis, pain with swallowing, COPD exacerbation, atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, and thrush.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. Proper management is essential to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia and underlying COPD. Adequate ventilation support and treatment of the underlying causes are necessary to prevent worsening respiratory distress.
3. Delirium: The patient is exhibiting signs of ICU delirium, which may be due to infection and underlying dementia. Close monitoring and appropriate pharmacological intervention are required to manage this condition.
4. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent the spread of infection.
5. Pain with Swallowing: The patient is experiencing pain with swallowing, possibly due to esophagitis. A failed swallow indicates an increased risk of aspiration, so proper feeding"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. He is currently being managed in the ICU for sepsis, hypercarbic respiratory failure, ICU delirium, cellulitis, pain with swallowing, and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and response to antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in origin including pneumonia, COPD, and congestive heart failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary. BIPAP may be continued to avoid intubation.
3. ICU delirium: The patient is experiencing ICU delirium, likely due to infection and underlying dementia. Regular assessment of mental status and adherence to sedation protocols are important.
4. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis, for which vancomycin has been prescribed. Monitoring for signs of improvement or worsening infection is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have been diagnosed with sepsis, MRSA bacteremia, pneumonia, COPD, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, coronary artery disease, and delirium. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an infection. If not properly managed, it can lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. MRSA Bacteremia/Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. If the infection spreads further or does not respond to antibiotics, it can result in worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has COPD, and there is a risk of exacerbation due to factors such as respiratory infections or inadequate control of underlying conditions. COPD exacerbations can lead to increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, and potentially respiratory failure.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. If left untreated or uncontrolled, it can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has coronary artery disease, which increases the risk of myocard"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. They have been diagnosed with Staphylococcus sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, antifungals, and medications for their other medical conditions. They have been on mechanical ventilation and are currently on nasal cannula oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for Staphylococcus sepsis. If not appropriately managed, there is a risk of progression to severe sepsis or septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.
2. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's respiratory distress and underlying COPD, there is a risk of respiratory failure. This can occur if the patient's airway becomes obstructed, if there is significant lung damage, or if the patient develops further respiratory complications.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR). These cardiac conditions can worsen due to the stress of sepsis and other factors, potentially leading to heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias.
4. Delirium: The patient is also diagnosed with delirium, which can be common in critically ill patients. Del"

   assessment above.
   He is more lucid and has the ability to expectorate thick blood tinged
   mucus when sitting upright. He is quite dyspneic with minimal exertion
   but denies chest pain. He is AAO X 3 now!
   He has improved air entry at lung bases and no edema. His WBC is normal
   but Na is up to 148.
   He will have tube feeds started, TPN weaned and attempts to get him
   OOB.
   I suspect he will need transfer to rehab this week if there are no
   further setbacks.
   We will start Diltiazem for HR control since amiodarone has yet not
   been able to preclude atrial tachycardia completely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and hypotension. He was intubated and started on vasopressors, then transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia, for which he is being treated with vancomycin. He also has atrial tachycardia, which has improved with amiodarone. The patient's COPD exacerbation is likely related to severe MRSA pneumonia, and he is being treated with prednisone, nebulizers, and xopenex. He has congestive heart failure, for which he is being started on Lasix. The patient is also experiencing ICU delirium, presumed esophagitis (thrush), and underlying dementia contributing to his condition. His current medications include amiodarone, diltiazem, flucanazole, Lasix, prednisone, xopenex, and TPN. The patient's blood pressure is currently 133/64 mmHg, heart rate is 76 bpm, respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. He has a normal white blood cell count but an elevated sodium level of 148. The patient's weight is 85.5 kg, and his height is 65 inches. He has received a total of 1,724 mL of fluids and lost 3,005 mL of urine, resulting in a fluid balance of -1,281 mL. His arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 58, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 203. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and troponin-T, as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin, albumin, and potassium. The patient's plan includes tube feeds, weaning of TPN, attempts to get him out of bed, and potential transfer to rehab if there are no further setbacks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia can lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can cause organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and severe MRSA pneumonia put him at risk for respiratory failure, especially if his respiratory rate increases or if he becomes hypoxic.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD, previous CABG, and atrial tachycardia indicate a risk for cardiac arrhythmias, which can be potentially life-threatening.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated levels of WBC and Hct, as well as his fluid balance, suggest a risk for acute renal failure due to inadequate renal perfusion.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was transferred to the ICU for further management and was found to have MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. MRSA bacteremia/MRSA pneumonia:
   - The patient has a confirmed MRSA infection in his bloodstream and lungs.
   - Treatment includes continuing vancomycin for a total 2-week course.
   - The patient's immune system may be weakened due to the infection, making him more susceptible to other complications.

2. Atrial Tachycardia:
   - The patient experienced episodes of rapid heart rate (tachycardia) overnight.
   - This was eventually improved with an amiodarone bolus.
   - The patient is continuing on amiodarone 400 mg per day.
   - The underlying cause of the atrial tachycardia needs further evaluation.

3. COPD Exacerbation:
   - The patient's COPD has worsened likely due to severe MRSA pneumonia.
   - Treatment includes switching to prednisone 60 mg daily.
   - Nebulized bronchodilators and prn albuterol are being administered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Atrial Flutter: The patient experienced recurrent tachycardia, which improved after administration of amiodarone.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's severe MRSA pneumonia likely contributed to his exacerbation of COPD.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were elevated, indicating a free water deficit. He received a 500 cc saline bolus and started on free water boluses via Dobhoff tube.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count increased to 18, indicating an ongoing infection. Urine culture, follow-up chest X-ray, and cultures were ordered.
5. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient was started on Lasix 40mg daily to manage CHF symptoms.
6. ICU Delirium: The patient required close monitoring and management for delirium, which was likely due to infection and underlying dementia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including atrial flutter, COPD exacerbation, acute renal failure, cardiomyopathy, septic shock, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has several comorbidities and is being managed with various medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Flutter: The patient has recurrent episodes of atrial flutter, which can lead to palpitations, dizziness, and an increased risk of stroke if not properly managed.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's severe MRSA pneumonia has likely triggered a COPD exacerbation. This can result in worsening respiratory symptoms, increased shortness of breath, and potentially respiratory failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can be caused by various factors, including sepsis, hypotension, and the use of certain medications.
4. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors suggest septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection and systemic inflammatory response.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia/pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing atrial tachycardia, which has been managed with medications such as diltiazem, amiodarone, and digoxin. He also has hypernatremia, leukocytosis, delirium, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA bacteremia/pneumonia: The patient's condition can worsen if the infection is not effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Atrial tachycardia: If the patient's heart rhythm is not properly managed, it can lead to complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The imbalance of sodium levels may cause neurological symptoms or dehydration if not corrected promptly.
4. Leukocytosis: An increased white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response that needs further evaluation.
5. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes require close monitoring, and delirium can prolong hospitalization and increase the risk of complications.
6. Fluid/electrolyte imbalance: Imbalances in"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). He is currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia/pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 89-151 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/74 to 155/152 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is currently paced.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, bronchial breath sounds on the left side with wheezes, and the use of accessory muscles for breathing. There is also evidence of right and left lower extremity edema, as well as muscle wasting.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Other lab values such as glucose, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for MRSA bacteremia/pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, atrial tachycardia, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, delirium, feeding tube nutrition, and CAD. The plan involves ongoing administration of antibiotics"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management and was determined to have MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions include atrial tachycardia, COPD exacerbation, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, CHF, ICU delirium, presumed esophagitis (thrush), and no active issues related to CAD, s/p CABG.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has recurrent tachycardia likely related to impaired oxygenation secondary to bronchospasm. Optimizing respiratory status and controlling heart rate are important to prevent further complications.

2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient likely has a severe MRSA pneumonia exacerbating his COPD. Continuing corticosteroids, nebulizer treatments, and chest physiotherapy will help manage the exacerbation and prevent respiratory failure.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to neurological complications if not corrected promptly. Free water boluses and careful monitoring of electrolytes are necessary to correct the sodium imbalance.

4. Leukocytosis: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was transferred to the ICU for further management and was determined to have MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing atrial tachycardia, COPD exacerbation, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, CHF, ICU delirium, thrush, and presumed esophagitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing recurrent tachycardia likely related to impaired oxygenation secondary to bronchospasm. This can lead to increased heart rate and potential arrhythmias.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's severe MRSA pneumonia is likely exacerbating his underlying COPD. This can result in worsening respiratory symptoms and increased difficulty breathing.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, which can lead to dehydration, confusion, seizures, and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count indicates an infection or inflammation. If not treated appropriately, it can progress to sepsis or septic shock.
5. CHF: The patient has signs of congestive heart failure, which can worsen"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and has been diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and cardiac medications. He is also being treated for agitation and a prolonged QTc interval. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA pneumonia, which can be a severe infection that requires aggressive treatment. Complications may include worsening respiratory symptoms, septic shock, or empyema.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, meaning that the MRSA infection has spread through his bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AoCRF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest possible acute kidney injury. This can be caused by factors such as dehydration, sepsis, or the use of certain medications.

4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF puts him at risk for fluid overload and worsening heart function. Medications such as Lasix, which promote diuresis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. The patient has been in the ICU and has experienced several medical complications. These include hypoxia related to COPD exacerbation and MRSA pneumonia, ICU delirium, atrial tachycardia, hypovolemia, prolonged QT interval, acute renal failure, and issues with nutrition. The patient's condition is currently stable but slow to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's COPD exacerbation and MRSA pneumonia can lead to persistent hypoxia, requiring ongoing respiratory support.
2. ICU Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, likely due to infection, steroids, and being in the ICU. This can increase the risk of falls, self-extubation, and other complications.
3. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial tachycardia, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and may require further treatment.
4. Hypovolemia: The patient has hypovolemia, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
5. Prolonged QT Interval: The patient's prolonged QT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent hospital stay for COPD exacerbation. He is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has an ongoing COPD exacerbation and pneumonia, leading to respiratory failure. He is on prednisone, vanc (vancomycin), and chest physiotherapy.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium likely due to infection, ICU stay, and steroids. He is being treated with haloperidol (Haldol).
3. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia, and amiodarone is being given intravenously for 24 hours. Digoxin will be discontinued.
4. Hypovolemia/hypernatremia: The patient has hypovolemia and hypernatremia, possibly due to dehydration. Fluid resuscitation with 1.2 liters of fluids overnight, free water boluses, and half-normal saline (1/2NS) at 150 mL/hr is planned.
5. Prolonged QTc: The patient has a prolonged QTc interval. Daily EKGs and electrolyte management to maintain magnesium >2 and potassium >4 are advised.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and currently admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia after a recent hospital stay for COPD exacerbation. 

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to the COPD exacerbation and pneumonia, delirium likely caused by infection, ICU stay, and steroids, atrial tachycardia, hypovolemia/hypernatremia, prolonged QTc, increased creatinine, feeding intolerance, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/44 mmHg to 134/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and heart rhythm as paced.

The patient's physical examination reveals agitation, poor dentition, distant heart sounds with irregular rhythm, wheezes on respiratory examination, muscle wasting, warm skin, and follows simple commands with intact purposeful movement but decreased muscle tone.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.8 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.

The patient's current medical complications include hypoxia, ICU delirium, atrial tachycardia, hypovolemia, prolonged QTc, acute renal failure, and nutrition issues.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and MRSA pneumonia put him at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory status is crucial.

2. Sepsis: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia indicate a systemic infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, increased heart rate, and hypotension, is necessary.

3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing ICU delirium, which may be due to infection, steroids, or the ICU environment. Frequent assessments of mental status and prompt intervention with haldol or seroquel as needed are important.

4. Atrial tachycardia: The patient's prolonged QTc and history of cardiac issues increase the risk of atrial tachycardia. Continuous monitoring of heart rhythm and adherence to the prescribed antiarrhythmic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). The patient has a history of atrial flutter, for which he was initially prescribed amiodarone and later switched to quinidine due to QTc prolongation. Quinidine levels were monitored, and the patient was eventually held from receiving quinidine for 24 hours. The patient also received metoprolol for rate control. Haloperidol was started to manage agitation. The patient is on prophylactic heparin, and his last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 04/26/2183 at 9:00 AM.

Vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/54 to 118/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is on respiratory support with an ABG showing hypoxemia.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 10.0 to 18.7 K/uL, anemia with a Hct ranging from 33.6% to 35.0%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count ranging from 109 to 130 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels from 1.4 to 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and previous right upper lobe lung resection. He presents with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has persistent wheezing on examination. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. He has been diagnosed with thrush and atrial tachycardia, and he has a history of coronary artery disease. The patient is also agitated and appears dehydrated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent wheezing and need for 3L positive pressure ventilation suggest ongoing respiratory failure. It is important to monitor his oxygenation and ventilation status closely.
2. Pulmonary Edema: Although the patient's chest X-ray does not show significant pulmonary edema, there is a possibility of developing fluid overload due to positive pressure ventilation and other factors. Close monitoring of fluid balance and respiratory status is necessary.
3. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial tachycardia, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and complications. Monitoring his heart rhythm and adjusting medications accordingly is essential.
4. Dehydration: The patient appears dehydrated"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was transferred to another hospital for further management and was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxia related to COPD exacerbation and MRSA pneumonia, which is stable but slow to improve. He is being treated with vancomycin, prednisone, nebs, and Q4hrs.

The patient also has ICU delirium, for which he is receiving haloperidol IV prn and monitoring of QTc daily. He has a history of atrial tachycardia and is currently on metoprolol.

The patient was previously hypovolemic but is improving, and acute renal failure has been attributed to hypovolemia, which has improved with volume resuscitation. He is being continued on renal dosing of medications.

Nutrition is a concern as the patient is taking minimal purees and still coughing. His nutrition plan includes a Dobhoff tube and TF feeding.

The patient's CAD status post CABG is currently not presenting any active issues.

The plan is to discharge the patient from the ICU directly to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility after completing a rehabilitation screening.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG who presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension. He was rapidly intubated and placed on vasopressors. The patient was transferred to the ICU and diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. His current conditions include hypoxia, ICU delirium, atrial tachycardia, hypovolemia, acute renal failure, and nutrition issues. The patient is currently on several medications including vancomycin, prednisone, nebs, chest PT, haloperidol, metoprolol, and others. His vital signs are stable but slow to improve. He is planned for discharge directly to a long-term acute care facility after completing a rehabilitation screening.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and current respiratory distress may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The presence of MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia increases the risk of sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
3. Delirium: The patient's ICU delirium can lead to increased agitation and confusion, potentially causing falls, self-harm, or other complications.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of CAD and previous CABG puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Renal Failure: Acute renal failure can occur due to hypovolemia or direct infection, which can worsen if not managed appropriately.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's difficulty in taking oral intake may result in malnutrition, which can affect his recovery and overall health.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and risk factors increase the likelihood of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection.
9. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications that can interact with each other, potentially causing adverse effects or reducing the effectiveness of treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG who presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension. He required rapid intubation and vasopressors and was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. The patient has several medical complications including delirium, atrial flutter, cellulitis, acute renal failure, cardiomyopathy, septic shock, and respiratory failure. He is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, prednisone, nebs, chest PT, haloperidol, and others. The patient's condition is stable but slow to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or metabolic imbalances. It is important to assess and manage potential underlying causes and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
2. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed effectively to improve comfort and overall well-being.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, a type of abnormal heart rhythm. Monitoring and managing this condition is crucial to prevent complications like stroke or palpitations.
4. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection. Prompt treatment with antibiotics and wound care is necessary to prevent further spread and potential complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, COPD exacerbation, aspiration pneumonia, and CHF. The patient's respiratory distress is the chief complaint. 

The patient is currently on several medications, including vancomycin, heparin, Plavix, rosuvastatin, neurontin, levothyroxine, aspirin, atrovent nebs, albuterol nebs, prednisone, haloperidol, lopressor, and others. 

On physical examination, the patient appears anxious with poor dentition and an NG tube in place. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 109/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient has crackles at the bases bilaterally on chest examination and trace lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows that the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but has not been assessed for movement or tone. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 10.0"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and currently admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient's course has been complicated by agitation. 

Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/55 to 128/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula and face tent. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has crackles at the bases bilaterally on lung examination.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results indicate elevated blood glucose levels and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals increased bilateral effusions and mild pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.

Plan and Assessment:
1. The patient's respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia will be managed by continuing vancomycin for a six-week course, increasing the dose to 1250 mg per day due to low trough levels, and tapering off prednisone.
2. Agitation will be addressed by reconsulting psychiatry for assistance with delir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was determined to have MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has COPD exacerbation and MRSA pneumonia, which can cause hypoxia. The patient's SpO2 is stable at 95% but may deteriorate if the underlying conditions worsen.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, as mentioned in the assessment and plan section. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as sepsis, medications, or underlying medical conditions.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, according to the doctor's note. This can be a result of the MRSA pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.
4. Septic Shock: The patient's condition indicates septic shock, as mentioned in the assessment and plan section. This is a severe complication of infection and can be life-threatening if not managed promptly and effectively.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely due to hypovolemia. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is experiencing dyspnea. This increases the risk of respiratory failure, particularly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the presence of MRSA pneumonia.

2. Septic shock: The patient has MRSA bacteremia, which puts him at risk for developing septic shock. His vital signs show low blood pressure, indicating potential hypotension.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Acute renal failure may occur due to sepsis, hypotension, or other underlying conditions.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG surgery. He also has atrial flutter and requires medications for pain control. These factors increase the risk of cardiomyopathy.

5. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be associated with infections, medications, and other underlying medical conditions"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and CABG.
- Presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors.
- Diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.
- Currently in the ICU, stable but slow to improve.
- Treatment includes vancomycin, prednisone, nebulizers, and chest physiotherapy.
- Experiencing delirium, pain control issues, atrial flutter, cellulitis, acute renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and septic shock.
- Other medical history includes COPD exacerbation, MRSA pneumonia, hypoxia, atrial tachycardia, hypovolemia, and acute renal failure.
- Plans for nutrition, glycemic control, and medication management are in place.
- Disposition is rehabilitation screening and discharge to a long-term acute care facility (LTAC) directly from the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and current respiratory symptoms indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Monitoring oxygen levels and providing appropriate respiratory support is essential.

2. Sepsis: With MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia, there is a high risk of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, infection control measures, and prompt antibiotic treatment are crucial.

3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delir"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently under close monitoring. The patient has a history of COPD, MRSA pneumonia, bacteremia, atrial tachycardia, and potential delirium. They also have a background of CAD and fenoradial edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits signs of delirium, which can be caused by factors such as infection, fatigue, or medication side effects. Close observation and intervention are necessary to manage this condition effectively.
2. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing an atrial tachycardia, which may be related to their underlying medical conditions or medications. Monitoring the QTc interval and considering restarting quinidine once off haldol will be important for managing this condition.
3. MRSA Pneumonia/Bacteremia: The patient has an active MRSA infection, requiring long-term vancomycin treatment. Aggressive pulmonary toilet, frequent suctioning, and monitoring for any signs of worsening infection are crucial.
4. COPD Flare: The patient's COPD has flared up in response to the MRSA pneumonia. Continuing prednisone treatment and addressing the underlying infection will be important for managing this condition.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which may complicate their current"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the hospital with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia after a recent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation. The patient's current course has been complicated by the management of atrial fibrillation and delirium.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/46 to 122/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, Plavix, Crestor, neurontin, synthroid, aspirin, atrovent/albuterol, and Lopressor.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. His blood cultures have tested positive for MRSA. Other lab values such as platelet count, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered bilateral rhonchi with expiratory wheeze, warm skin, and trace edema bilaterally. The patient is currently intubated and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, and recent hospitalizations for MRSA pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. He presented to the hospital with respiratory distress and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's current course is complicated by the management of atrial fibrillation and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/altered mental status: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be caused by infection, fatigue, or other factors. It is important to monitor his mental status closely and provide appropriate care, such as ensuring adequate oxygenation and providing psychiatric input if necessary.
2. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia, which may require further evaluation and management. Restarting quinidine once off haldol and monitoring the QTc interval are recommended.
3. MRSA pneumonia/bacteremia: The patient has MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy with vancomycin. Aggressive pulmonary toilet, including chest physiotherapy and frequent suctioning, should be continued.
4. COPD flare: The patient's COPD is exacerbated due to the MRSA pneumonia. Continuing prednisone treatment and addressing any underlying triggers are important.
5. CAD: The patient's CAD needs ongoing management with appropriate medications like ASA, Plavix, and beta-blockers.
6. Fluid balance: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia. He is currently experiencing delirium, atrial tachycardia, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient is also on medication for pain control and has a history of cellulitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is showing signs of confusion and agitation. This could be due to the underlying infection or other factors such as medication side effects. It is important to monitor the patient closely and adjust medications accordingly.

2. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has had episodes of atrial tachycardia, which can be caused by various factors including infection, stress, or underlying heart conditions. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rate and consider restarting quinidine when the patient is able to take full pills orally.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient previously experienced acute renal failure, but it has since resolved. However, close monitoring of renal function is still necessary to ensure early detection of any potential deterioration.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to an exacerbation of his underlying COPD and the presence of MRSA pneumonia. Continued respiratory support"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They have been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, sedation, and respiratory support. The patient's condition has been improving, with no agitation requiring sedating medications and an improving mental status. However, the patient continues to have difficulty tolerating oral intake and requires nasogastric tube feeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to mental status changes, pneumonia, and reactive airways disease. To prevent further complications, aggressive pulmonary toilet, including frequent mouth care, chest physiotherapy, and deep suctioning, will be performed. Aspiration precautions will also be implemented, including constant elevation of the head of the bed. The patient will continue with prednisone tapering and vancomycin for a total of 6 weeks.
2. Arrhythmia: The patient is currently on lopressor, and quinidine sulfate will be started. Quinidine can be crushed and administered through a Dobhoff tube.
3. Aspiration: The patient will continue with NG tube nutrition, and speech pathology will follow up. 

Please note that the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their complex medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 yo male with a history of COPD on home O2, CAD, s/p CABG
   presented to OSH with dyspnea and hypotension requiring rapid
   intubation and vasopressors transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further management
   and determined to have MRSA bacteremia.
   # Hypotension / Septic Shock
   Concern for septic etiology given elevated WBC today
 possible new
   aspiration pneumonia given abundant secretions and increased O2
   requirement yesterday.  However, lactate has been normal. Would also
   consider contribution from quinidine, though BP remain low despite held
   dose last night. Less likely, cardiogenic or hypovolemic etiology
   however . Does not appear to have significant autopeep/PTX
   - Continue neo to MAP>65
   - Consider vigileo to monitor CvO2, hold on CVL for now
   - Follow urine output, goal 0.5cc/kg/hr
   - Repeat TTE
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up pending micro, culture if febrile
   - Continue zosyn and vancomycin
 no double coverage for pseudomonas
   for now, but can expand if spikes
   - CT to r/o abcess if any fevers, continued decompensation
   # Afib and h/o Atach
   Episode of tachycardia this AM likely afib, probably exacerbated by
   levophed, infection
   - HOLD quinidine for now per d/w EP, keep patient on amiodarone in
   hospital
   - Continue amio load
   - Will address quinidine again as outpt with EP
   - Follow K, Magnesium closely and replete
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure, h/o COPD
   Possibly related to pulmonary infection and higher than target O2 sats
   yesterday. He did not recently get any sedating meds
 depakote 1 dose
   the day prior. Acidosis may be [**2-25**] hypotension
   - Continue ventilation, permissive hypercapnia
   - Check resistances
   - Trial of PSV as tolerated later today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
   # Acute kidney injury
   Cr up slightly today. In setting of hypotension, would be concerned for
   ATN. Also consider prerenal from poor cardiac perfusion
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>30cc/hr)
   - [**Month (only) 51**] check urine lytes
   # MRSA bacteremia
   Patient had cleared his recent blood cultures.
   - Continue vancomycin with planned 6 week duration given ICD, d1=[**4-17**]
   - Follow vancomycin trough with changing renal function
   #Tremulousness
   Ddx rigors vs. toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, less likely seizure
   - Follow for now, if focal signs pursue head imaging consider neuro c/s
   # ICU Delirium: Likely multifactorial related to infection,
   polypharmacy, prolongued ICU stay
   - Hold all sedating meds at this time
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient has been determined to have MRSA bacteremia and is experiencing several medical complications.

1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressors. There is concern for septic shock given the elevated white blood cell count today, possible new aspiration pneumonia, and increased oxygen requirement yesterday. Lactate levels have been normal. It is less likely that the hypotension is due to cardiogenic or hypovolemic causes. The plan includes continuing neo to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, considering the use of Vigileo to monitor cardiac output, and following urine output.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had an episode of tachycardia this morning, likely atrial fibrillation, possibly exacerbated by levophed and infection. Quinidine has been held per consultation with a cardiologist, and the patient will remain on amiodarone in the hospital. The plan includes continuing amiodarone and repleting potassium and magnesium.

3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient may have hypercarbic respiratory failure related to pulmonary infection and higher than target oxygen saturation yesterday. This may be due to"

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further management and was determined to have MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia due to COPD exacerbation and MRSA pneumonia. It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's oxygen levels and ensuring adequate ventilation support.
2. ICU Delirium: The patient is showing signs of ICU delirium, which can be challenging to manage. Close monitoring and adjustments in sedation medications may be necessary.
3. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has a history of atrial tachycardia and intolerance to certain medications due to low EF (ejection fraction). Close cardiac monitoring and appropriate medication adjustments will be needed.
4. Acute renal failure: Although resolved, there is a history of acute renal failure, and ongoing monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Nutrition: The patient is experiencing difficulty with enteral feeding, as indicated by minimal puree intake and continued coughing. Nutritional support should be closely monitored.
6. CAD, s/p CABG: The patient's history of CAD and previous CABG surgery requires ongoing assessment"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG.
- He presented to OSH with dyspnea and hypotension requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors.
- The patient was transferred to Hospital1 for further management and determined to have MRSA bacteremia.
- He has been experiencing hypoxia related to COPD exacerbation and MRSA pneumonia.
- The patient is also dealing with ICU delirium, atrial tachycardia, acute renal failure, and nutrition issues.
- He has a history of CAD and s/p CABG, but currently, there are no active issues related to these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation and progression suggest the possibility of sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's respiratory symptoms and underlying COPD, there is a risk of developing ARDS.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is intubated, there is a risk of developing VAP.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing ICU delirium, which can complicate recovery and increase the risk of other complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and s/p CABG puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythm"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and CABG.
- He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors.
- The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management and was determined to have MRSA bacteremia.
- He is currently experiencing hypotension, possibly due to septic shock or aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's condition has worsened, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation.
- Other complications include atrial fibrillation, hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and ICU delirium.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and elevated WBC count suggest a possible septic etiology. This could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's abundant secretions and increased O2 requirement may indicate aspiration pneumonia. If left untreated, this can lead to worsening respiratory failure and potentially septic shock.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recent episode of tachycardia likely represents atrial fibrillation. This condition increases the risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke, and requires anticoagulation management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG who presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension. He required rapid intubation and vasopressors and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia. He has also shown signs of septic shock, possibly exacerbated by an episode of atrial fibrillation. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure. Additionally, there are concerns about acute kidney injury and ICU delirium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension despite vasopressor support indicates a potential septic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output is necessary. Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's increased O2 requirement and abundant secretions, there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory status and potential septicemia. Cultures and imaging studies may be needed for confirmation.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recent episode of rapid atrial fibrillation needs to be closely monitored. This arrhythmia increases the risk of thromboembolic events and requires anticoagulation management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG.
- He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors.
- The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and possible aspiration pneumonia.
- He is currently experiencing hypotension, possibly due to septic shock or other causes.
- The patient has an episode of tachycardia this morning, likely atrial fibrillation.
- He is also dealing with hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly related to his pulmonary infection and higher than target O2 sats yesterday.
- The patient has acute kidney injury, with a slight increase in creatinine levels.
- He is receiving various treatments including ventilation, PSV trial, steroid taper, MDIs, and antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia.
- The patient is showing signs of tremulousness, which could be related to rigors, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, or seizures.
- He is also displaying symptoms of ICU delirium, likely multifactorial in origin.
- The patient's cardiovascular status is stable with no active issues related to CAD and CABG.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous CABG.
- He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors.
- The patient was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and is currently being treated with vancomycin.
- He has been experiencing multiple medical complications including hypotension/septic shock, atrial fibrillation, hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and ICU delirium.
- The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs, increased oxygen requirement, and poor urine output.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, and abnormal liver and kidney function tests.
- He is currently on multiple medications including propofol, norepinephrine, heparin, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension despite vasopressor support suggests ongoing septic shock. Immediate management should focus on maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, placing a central line to check central venous pressure (CVP), monitoring urine output, repeating a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and following up with pending microbiology cultures.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 yo male with a history of COPD on home O2, CAD, s/p CABG
   presented to OSH with dyspnea and hypotension requiring rapid
   intubation and vasopressors transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further management
   and determined to have MRSA bacteremia.
   # Hypotension / Septic Shock
   Concern for septic etiology given elevated WBC today
 possible new
   aspiration pneumonia given abundant secretions and increased O2
   requirement yesterday.  However, lactate has been normal. Would also
   consider contribution from quinidine, though BP remain low despite held
   dose last night. Less likely, cardiogenic or hypovolemic etiology
   however . Does not appear to have significant autopeep/PTX
   - Continue neo to MAP>65
   - Consider vigileo to monitor CvO2, hold on CVL for now
   - Follow urine output, goal 0.5cc/kg/hr
   - Repeat TTE
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up pending micro, culture if febrile
   - Continue zosyn and vancomycin
 no double coverage for pseudomonas
   for now, but can expand if spikes
   - CT to r/o abcess if any fevers, continued decompensation
   # Afib and h/o Atach
   Episode of tachycardia this AM likely afib, probably exacerbated by
   levophed, infection
   - HOLD quinidine for now per d/w EP, keep patient on amiodarone in
   hospital
   - Continue amio load
   - Will address quinidine again as outpt with EP
   - Follow K, Magnesium closely and replete
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure, h/o COPD
   Possibly related to pulmonary infection and higher than target O2 sats
   yesterday. He did not recently get any sedating meds
 depakote 1 dose
   the day prior. Acidosis may be [**2-25**] hypotension
   - Continue ventilation, permissive hypercapnia
   - Check resistances
   - Trial of PSV as tolerated later today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
   # Acute kidney injury
   Cr up slightly today. In setting of hypotension, would be concerned for
   ATN. Also consider prerenal from poor cardiac perfusion
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>30cc/hr)
   - [**Month (only) 51**] check urine lytes
   # MRSA bacteremia
   Patient had cleared his recent blood cultures.
   - Continue vancomycin with planned 6 week duration given ICD, d1=[**4-17**]
   - Follow vancomycin trough with changing renal function
   #Tremulousness
   Ddx rigors vs. toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, less likely seizure
   - Follow for now, if focal signs pursue head imaging consider neuro c/s
   # ICU Delirium: Likely multifactorial related to infection,
   polypharmacy, prolongued ICU stay
   - Hold all sedating meds at this time
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, which required rapid intubation and vasopressors. He was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension requiring vasopressor support, increased oxygen requirement, and signs of possible aspiration pneumonia. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. His ABG results indicate hypercapnia (PaCO2 of 55 mmHg), which suggests hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient also has an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation (likely exacerbated by infection and levophed), and there are concerns about acute kidney injury and ICU delirium.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these findings include worsening septic shock, further deterioration in respiratory function, progression of aspiration pneumonia, worsening of atrial fibrillation, and potential development of renal failure. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values to promptly identify any changes or complications."

   1. Sepsis/Hypotension: progressive hypercarbia followed by gradual
   decrease in blood pressures with acute decompensation after intubation,
   his hemodynamics are likely secondary to increased SIRS response to
   aspiration pneumonia, compounded by inability to [**Location 14469**] cardiac
   output due to cardiomyopathy.  Overall, likely [**2-25**] sedation, intubation

    - cont IV amiodarone at 1mg/kg
    - he will likely need to stay on this medication during
   hospitalization
    - discontinue quinidine
    - monitor QTc
   3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: likely [**2-25**] increased secretions on
   top of poor pulmonary reserve with inability to overcompensate
    - his baseline CO2 likely 60-70s

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has shown signs of sepsis with progressive hypercarbia and a decrease in blood pressures. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia and compounded by the inability to maintain cardiac output due to cardiomyopathy.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has developed wide-complex tachycardia, which is more consistent with atrial fibrillation with aberrancy. This requires continuous intravenous amiodarone and monitoring of QTc.

3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has experienced increased respiratory secretions on top of poor pulmonary reserve, leading to an inability to overcompensate. This could be due to the patient's baseline CO2 levels likely in the 60-70s. Continuous steroid taper and nebulizers should be continued.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure (AoCRF): The patient likely has pre-renal acute kidney injury in the setting of hypotension. It is important to check urine lytes and maintain uop > 0.5 mg/kg/hr with either diuresis or volume pending assessment of volume status.

5. Tremulousness: The patient may be experiencing tremulousness due to hypercarbia and discomfort. There are no focal abnormalities observed.

6. Bacteremia: Vancomycin should be continued"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They presented with increased respiratory secretions overnight and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient also experienced hypotension after receiving propofol, succinylcholine, and etomidate, necessitating the administration of vasopressor medication (levo, then neo). The patient's chest X-ray showed no significant new infiltrate, and their antibiotics were broadened to include Zosyn. The patient was diagnosed with wide-complex tachycardia, which was determined to be atrial fibrillation with aberrancy, prompting the initiation of amiodarone drip and discontinuation of quinidine. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including phenylephrine, propofol, amiodarone, and heparin sodium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's hemodynamics are likely secondary to increased systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to aspiration pneumonia, compounded by an inability to maintain cardiac output due to cardiomyopathy. This can lead to septic shock and further hypotension.
2. Tachycardia: The patient appears to have atrial fibrillation with aberrancy. If not managed appropriately, this condition may progress and lead"

   Assessment and Plan
    68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD
   ( s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure
   in setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia.
   # Hypotension / Septic Shock:   Lactate now improving from 1.5 to .9.
   Etiology based on recent labs and work-up showing likely cause was MRSA
   PNA and bacteremia. WBC trend improving and afebrile overnight.  BPs
   remain low but stable in the high 90s-130s systolic on neosynephrine
   now.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65
   - trend lactate and  monitor CvO2 q8hrs
 if acutely worsened switch
   back to levophed from neosynephrine
   - Follow urine output, goal 30 cc/hr
   .- Follow up all pending micro/ culture data
   -CIS
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Drop in HCT from 30 to 24.9 range now. Positive guaiac
   today and questionable abdominal discomfort.
   -stat repeat HCT
   -will trend HCTs q 8 hours
   -check repeat stool guaiacs / abdominal exams
   -hold SC heparin for now
   -given cardiac hx, will give 1 Unit PRBCs  .
   .
   # Atrial ectopy ( a-fib and atrial tachycardia ) :
   Relatively well controlled overnight. [**Month (only) 51**] be from infection and was
   exacerbated in setting of recent Levophed so switched to neosynephrine.
   -cont telemetry
   -f/up EP recs
 s/p Amio load, will switch to PO amiodarone today l
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete PRN
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Exacerbated in setting of PNA with
   sepsis. Also has baseline  h/o COPD on oxygen at home.
   - treat PNA as above
   - Continue A/C ventilation, permissive hypercapnia
   - based on recent gas with worse PO2 will increase Fi02 to 35-40% again
   and consider decrease RR from 20
 15 and recheck ABG
   - Check resistances
   - Trial of PSV as tolerated
 likely later this weekend
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.6 range. Likely elevated In setting of
   hypotension and probable element of recent  ATN.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>30cc/hr)
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   --opting to hold Plavix for upcoming IP bronch/biopsy
   - continue  ASA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, s/p CABG, and RUL lobectomy for prior lung cancer. He was admitted for hypotension and respiratory failure in the setting of MRSA bacteremia. The patient's condition has been improving, with stable vital signs and decreasing lactate levels. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure is being managed with neosynephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. The plan is to continue IV vancomycin for 6 weeks and monitor lactate and CV O2 every 8 hours. If the patient's condition worsens, levophed may be reintroduced.

2. HCT Drop: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has dropped from 30 to 24.9 range, and a positive guaiac test suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. Repeat HCTs will be trending every 8 hours, and abdominal exams will be performed. SC heparin has been held, and the patient will receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to the cardiac history.

3. Atrial ectopy (a-fib and atrial tachycardia): The patient's atrial arrhythmias have been relatively well-controlled overnight. Telemetry will continue, and the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 yo male with a history of COPD on home O2, CAD, s/p CABG
   presented to OSH with dyspnea and hypotension requiring rapid
   intubation and vasopressors transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further management
   and determined to have MRSA bacteremia.
   # Hypotension / Septic Shock
   Concern for septic etiology given elevated WBC today
 possible new
   aspiration pneumonia given abundant secretions and increased O2
   requirement yesterday.  However, lactate has been normal. Would also
   consider contribution from quinidine, though BP remain low despite held
   dose last night. Less likely, cardiogenic or hypovolemic etiology
   however . Does not appear to have significant autopeep/PTX
   - Continue neo to MAP>65
   - Consider vigileo to monitor CvO2, hold on CVL for now
   - Follow urine output, goal 0.5cc/kg/hr
   - Repeat TTE
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up pending micro, culture if febrile
   - Continue zosyn and vancomycin
 no double coverage for pseudomonas
   for now, but can expand if spikes
   - CT to r/o abcess if any fevers, continued decompensation
   # Afib and h/o Atach
   Episode of tachycardia this AM likely afib, probably exacerbated by
   levophed, infection
   - HOLD quinidine for now per d/w EP, keep patient on amiodarone in
   hospital
   - Continue amio load
   - Will address quinidine again as outpt with EP
   - Follow K, Magnesium closely and replete
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure, h/o COPD
   Possibly related to pulmonary infection and higher than target O2 sats
   yesterday. He did not recently get any sedating meds

   the day prior. Acidosis may be [**2-25**] hypotension
   - Continue ventilation, permissive hypercapnia
   - Check resistances
   - Trial of PSV as tolerated later today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
   # Acute kidney injury
   Cr up slightly today. In setting of hypotension, would be concerned for
   ATN. Also consider prerenal from poor cardiac perfusion
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>30cc/hr)
   - [**Month (only) 51**] check urine lytes
   # MRSA bacteremia
   Patient had cleared his recent blood cultures.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and s/p CABG. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea and hypotension, requiring rapid intubation and vasopressors. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management and was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension that may be due to septic shock. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia as well.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had an episode of tachycardia this morning, which is likely atrial fibrillation. This could be exacerbated by levophed and infection.
3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly related to pulmonary infection and higher than target oxygen saturations yesterday.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels have increased today, indicating a possible acute kidney injury. This could be due to hypotension or prerenal causes.
5. ICU Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing delirium, which is multifactorial and related to infection, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Lung Cancer: There is a possibility of recurrent lung cancer given the collapse of the left upper lobe.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has"

The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory failure, secretions, agitation, and reintubation.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has MRSA pneumonia and COPD, along with volume overload. The plan includes administering Zosyn, vancomycin for 6 weeks, diuresis, and a trial of spontaneous breathing test (SBT) once diuresed.

2. Hypotension (HoTN): The patient likely has sepsis-induced hypotension and an inability to compensate due to cardiomyopathy and propofol. The plan involves maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 with norepinephrine and appears volume overloaded, so starting diuresis with Lasix gtt aim 25-50cc/hr for TBB -500 to 1L.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent admission with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory failure, secretions, agitation, and reintubation. The patient's current condition includes bronchoscopy with likely left upper lobe infiltrating mass, central venous line (CVL) placement, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and restart of amiodarone.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and has limited movement.

The patient's physical examination reveals edema in the lower extremities, muscle wasting, warm skin on the right lower extremity, and cool skin on the left lower extremity. Neurological assessment is not available.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated troponin-T, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

1. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which revealed a malignant mass. However, a biopsy could not be taken due to the patient being on Plavix. Plavix was discontinued, and the patient was started on Lasix with urine output ranging from 80-100 cc/hr.

2. The patient's blood guaiac test was negative, and their hematocrit (Hct) decreased. As a result, the patient received a blood transfusion and was started on IV pantoprazole (Protonix).

3. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response around 10 pm, accompanied by hypotension. They were started on amiodarone (GTT) at 0.5 mg/min.

4. Lactate levels were recorded at 0.5 and 0.8, and central venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) ranged from 59 to 63.

5. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/67 to 158/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia new found to have new L lobe mass
   likely malignancy.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Exacerbated in setting of PNA with
   sepsis. Also has baseline  h/o COPD on oxygen at home. Also now found
   to have left mass. Has evidence of decreased compliance on vent [**2-25**]
   lung injury
   - Continue A/C ventilation, permissive hypercapnia, so want to keep
   tidal volumes low. Goal to keep Tv around 400, tolerating this without
   increased sedation
   - Still needs the vent [**2-25**] decreased compliance
   - Also, will need intubation for repeat bronch in OR after plavix
   washout for repeat bronch with biopsy
   - Continue diuresis to goal 1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
 day#12 of steroids today, will
   continue for 2 more days
   # Hypotension / Septic Shock:   [**2-25**] MRSA PNA. Being treated for HAP. BP
   has been stable on neo (0.1mcg/kg/min). Likely vasodilatory shock
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #3) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   .- Follow up all pending micro/ culture data

   # Atrial ectopy ( a-fib and atrial tachycardia ) : Plan to continue on
   amiodarone, and switch to quinidine as outpatient
   Restarted on IV amio drip yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] be from infection and was
   exacerbated in setting of recent Levophed so switched to neosynephrine.
   -cont telemetry
   -f/up EP recs
 s/p Amio load, will switch back to PO amiodarone today
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Drop in HCT from 30 to 24.9 range now. Positive guaiac
   today and questionable abdominal discomfort. Received 1 unit pRBCs
   yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] be stress gastritis
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25
   -check repeat stool guaiacs / abdominal exams
   -hold SC heparin for now .
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.6 range. Likely elevated In setting of
   hypotension and probable element of recent  ATN.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>50cc/hr)

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and CAD who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure. He has an MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia and is suspected to have a new left lung mass, likely malignancy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with permissive hypercapnia, intubated, and sedated. He is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia and sepsis. The patient also has atrial ectopy, including atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia, and is on amiodarone. His HCT dropped from 30 to 24.9 range, possibly due to stress gastritis or blood loss, and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells. His creatinine is still elevated at 1.6 range, possibly due to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has exacerbated hypercarbic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and sepsis. It is important to continue A/C ventilation and keep tidal volumes low to avoid further lung injury.
2. Decreased compliance of the left lung: The patient has evidence of decreased compliance on the left lung, which may require adjustments in ventilation settings and possibly intubation for a repeat bronchoscopy with biopsy.
3. Hypotension/septic shock: The patient has hypotension and septic shock secondary to"

   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia.
   # Hypotension / Septic Shock:   Lactate now improving from 1.5 to .9.
   Etiology based on recent labs and work-up showing likely cause was MRSA
   PNA and bacteremia. WBC trend improving and afebrile overnight.  BPs
   remain low but stable in the high 90s-130s systolic on neosynephrine
   now.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65
   - trend lactate and  monitor CvO2 q8hrs
 if acutely worsened switch
   back to levophed from neosynephrine
   - Follow urine output, goal 30 cc/hr
   .- Follow up all pending micro/ culture data
   -CIS
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Drop in HCT from 30 to 24.9 range now. Positive guaiac
   today and questionable abdominal discomfort.
   -stat repeat HCT
   -will trend HCTs q 8 hours
   -check repeat stool guaiacs / abdominal exams
   -hold SC heparin for now
   -given cardiac hx, will give 1 Unit PRBCs  .
   .
   # Atrial ectopy ( a-fib and atrial tachycardia ) :
   Relatively well controlled overnight. [**Month (only) 51**] be from infection and was
   exacerbated in setting of recent Levophed so switched to neosynephrine.
   -cont telemetry
   -f/up EP recs
 s/p Amio load, will switch to PO amiodarone today l
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete PRN
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Exacerbated in setting of PNA with
   sepsis. Also has baseline  h/o COPD on oxygen at home.
   - treat PNA as above
   - Continue A/C ventilation, permissive hypercapnia
   - based on recent gas with worse PO2 will increase Fi02 to 35-40% again
   and consider decrease RR from 20
 15 and recheck ABG
   - Check resistances
   - Trial of PSV as tolerated
 likely later this weekend
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.6 range. Likely elevated In setting of
   hypotension and probable element of recent  ATN.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>30cc/hr)
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   --opting to hold Plavix for upcoming IP bronch/biopsy

   Assessment and Plan
   Please see resident note for details.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
  likely lung injury (P:F < 200, compliance ~20;
   SBT due to low tidal volumes).  Continue lung protective strategy (i.e.
   Low tidal volume ventilation), continue antibiotics, net diuresis as
   tolerated.
   HYPOTENSION
 Continues to require vasopressor.  Plan transitioning
   from Levophed to Neosinephrine.  Likely vasodilatory given exam, high
   CVO2.  Repeat cv02 for now, follow up cultures, cont. neoosinephrine,
   maintain MAP> 60 mmHg.
   A-FIB
 Good response with rate control on amnioderone.
   FLIUDS
 desire net negative if tolerated, although low BP/vasopressor
   dependence may be limiting.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has a history of CHF, CAD, COPD, NSCLC, and possibly recurrent malignancy.
- The patient experienced hypercapnic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypotension.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and is receiving vasopressors for hemodynamic support.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, low platelet count, and elevated glucose levels.
- The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia.
- The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate.
- The patient's physical examination reveals hyperresonant percussion notes on the chest and trace bilateral lower extremity edema.
- The patient's neurologic status is not assessed due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and decreased venous return can increase the risk of DVT formation, which may lead to a potentially life-threatening PE.
3. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures can increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is hypercapnic respiratory failure. They have a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a new left upper lobe process possibly indicating recurrent malignancy.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin), vasopressors (Phenylephrine), antiarrhythmics (Amiodarone), diuretics (Furosemide), and sedatives (Propofol). 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 35%. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's lab results reveal elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, lactate, and troponin levels. The platelet count is slightly low, and the total bilir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, ischemic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia (VT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker (PM) placement, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and a past lung cancer that underwent right upper lobe (RUL) lobectomy. The patient was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis, leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), anticoagulants, antibiotics, vasopressor support with phenylephrine, sedation with propofol, and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). The patient's condition has shown improvements in respiratory compliance and oxygenation.

However, there are several potential medical complications to consider:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline COPD and recent MRSA pneumonia have exacerbated his respiratory failure, resulting in hypercarbia. This is a concern for ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and should be closely monitored.
2. Left-sided lung mass: A new left lobe mass has been identified, which raises concerns"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, and CAD (s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to MRSA PNA and bacteremia. He also has a new left lobe mass likely malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline h/o COPD and recent lung injury may exacerbate his hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Decreased compliance on vent: The patient's lung injury may lead to further decreased compliance on the ventilator, potentially worsening his respiratory status.
3. Hypotension/septic shock: The patient's hypotension and history of MRSA PNA suggest ongoing septic shock. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Atrial ectopy (a-fib and atrial tachycardia): The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent development of atrial tachycardia indicate ongoing cardiac rhythm disturbances. Continuous telemetry monitoring and adjustment of antiarrhythmic medications are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia new found to have new L lobe mass
   likely malignancy.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Exacerbated in setting of PNA with
   sepsis. Also has baseline  h/o COPD on oxygen at home. Also now found
   to have left mass. Has evidence of decreased compliance on vent [**2-25**]
   lung injury
   - Continue A/C ventilation, permissive hypercapnia, so want to keep
   tidal volumes low. Goal to keep Tv around 400, tolerating this without
   increased sedation
   - Still needs the vent [**2-25**] decreased compliance
   - Also, will need intubation for repeat bronch in OR after plavix
   washout for repeat bronch with biopsy
   - Continue diuresis to goal 1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
 day#12 of steroids today, will
   continue for 2 more days
   # Hypotension / Septic Shock:   [**2-25**] MRSA PNA. Being treated for HAP. BP
   has been stable on neo (0.1mcg/kg/min). Likely vasodilatory shock
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #3) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   .- Follow up all pending micro/ culture data
   .
   # Atrial ectopy ( a-fib and atrial tachycardia ) : Plan to continue on
   amiodarone, and switch to quinidine as outpatient
   Restarted on IV amio drip yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] be from infection and was
   exacerbated in setting of recent Levophed so switched to neosynephrine.
   -cont telemetry
   -f/up EP recs
 s/p Amio load, will switch back to PO amiodarone today
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Drop in HCT from 30 to 24.9 range now. Positive guaiac
   today and questionable abdominal discomfort. Received 1 unit pRBCs
   yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] be stress gastritis
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25
   -check repeat stool guaiacs / abdominal exams
   -hold SC heparin for now .
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.6 range. Likely elevated In setting of
   hypotension and probable element of recent  ATN.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>50cc/hr)
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   --opting to hold Plavix for upcoming IP bronch/biopsy
   - continue  ASA 81mg

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, ischemic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia (with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and pacemaker), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on home oxygen), and prior lung cancer (right upper lobe lobectomy). He was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and sepsis, which led to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Positive guaiac and hemoglobin concentration drop: The patient has received one unit of packed red blood cells. The cause of the hemoglobin drop is suspected to be stress gastritis. It is important to trend hemoglobin levels, perform repeat stool guaiacs, and check abdominal exams. The patient should be kept with a hemoglobin concentration greater than 25.

2. Hypotension and septic shock: The patient is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Blood pressure has been stable on neoephrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min). Vasodilatory shock is likely, and the plan is to continue Zosyn for 10 days and vancomycin for 6 weeks. Neoephrine will be weaned as tolerated, aiming for a mean arterial pressure greater than 65.

3. Decreased pulmonary compliance and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient is on ARDS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a complicated medical history, including ongoing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He presented with sepsis and hypoxemia and is currently in the ICU. The patient is mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube, receiving supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation. He is also receiving multiple infusions of medications, including phenylephrine, propofol, amiodarone, and pantoprazole.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to lung injury. The plan is to continue with lung-protective ventilation strategies, including low tidal volume ventilation, and continue antibiotics and diuresis as tolerated. The patient's gas exchange has improved, but he is not yet ready for extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to require low-dose vasopressor support.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with rate control using amiodarone.
4. Fluids: Gentle diuresis is being implemented.
5. Nutrition: The patient is receiving NovaSource Renal (Full) via a feeding tube.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored and managed appropriately.
7. Lines: The patient has multiple lines in place, including a PICC line, arterial line, and multi"

   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia new found to have new L lobe mass
   likely malignancy awaiting plavix washout for biopsy of mass in OR.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Multifactorial: baseline COPD, less
   lung volume on R and new L lung mass, volume overload with decreased
   compliance. Also has difficulty with secretions.
   - Hold on extubation due to inability to tolerate P/S. [**Month (only) 51**] have repeat
   bronch with biopsy as early as tomorrow (Tu) by IP
   - Continue diuresis by lasix gtt to goal 1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
 day#14 of predisone 20mg today,
   plan to switch to 10mg PO prednisone tomorrow [**5-6**]
   # L sided lung mass, concern for cancer recurrence
   - Plan for repeat bronch/biopsy tomorrow/Wed by IP
   - Hold TF after midnight in case procedure tomorrow
   # Hypotension: Likely component of hypotension from propofol. Also s/p
   septic physiology.   Being treated for HAP. Still pressor dependent.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #5) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   .- Follow up all pending micro/ culture data, none positive so far
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone. [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt.
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pain, atrial flutter, cellulitis, renal failure, and cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the ICU for septic shock, acute respiratory failure, delirium, hypotension, and pain control. The patient has been receiving various treatments including lasix, press support, PPI, heparin, and neo-synephrine. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and an FiO2 of 35%. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 124/53 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 154-215 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 211. The patient's renal function is impaired with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 27.6 mL/min. The patient's overall condition remains stable with no recent complications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current renal function is compromised, and further deterioration in kidney"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, CAD, and lung cancer. He was admitted with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia and is now suspected to have recurrent lung cancer. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 119/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia and suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anticoagulants, and cardiovascular support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to the inability to control secretions and poor respiratory reserve caused by underlying pneumonia, right upper lobe resection, and left upper lobe involvement by an obstructing lesion. There is a need to establish goals of care prior to extubation.

2. Hypotension: The patient is pressor-dependent and requires neosynephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. 

3. Tachycardia: The patient has been prescribed amiodarone (400 mg) to manage tachycardia.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (hct) was trending down but is now stable."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and lung cancer, admitted with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia.
- The patient has likely recurrent lung cancer and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure.
- He is receiving mechanical ventilation and is pressor-dependent for hypotension.
- His heart rate is elevated (tachycardia), and he is on amiodarone for rhythm control.
- His hemoglobin levels have been decreasing but are now stable.
- He has a history of anemia, but the cause is unclear.
- There are concerns about acute on chronic renal failure.
- The patient had a previous CABG surgery and is not taking Plavix while awaiting a biopsy.
- Discussions are ongoing regarding possible tracheostomy and peg tube placement or DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure, likely due to underlying pneumonia, right upper lobe resection, and left upper lobe involvement of an obstructing lesion.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient is pressor-dependent, indicating a need for ongoing support to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia found to have new L lobe mass on
   recent bronchoscopy concerning for recurrent cancer & now awaiting IP
   repeat bronch/biopsy this morning
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Very poor reserve due to baseline
   COPD. He also had prior RUL lobectomy in
96 for lung cancer. On serial
   imaging he has less lung volume on R and now a newer L lung mass and
   respiratory failure with need for intubation despite multiple broad
   antibiotics.  He also has ongoing volume overload issue with decreased
   compliance overall making his ventilation in ICU challenging. Excessive
   secretions continue. Plan for IP bronch/biopsy today.
   - IP procedure with bronch/biopsy today
   - Holding on extubation due to inability to tolerate P/S
   - Continue diuresis by lasix gtt to goal -1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
 day#15 of predisone 20mg today,
   plan to switch to 10mg today
   # L sided lung mass:  major concern for cancer recurrence
   - follow-up results of repeat bronch/biopsy today by IP
   - Holding TF until after procedure done
   - d/w IP when safe to place back on Plavix ( if at all) after biopsy
   # Hypotension: Still having transient episodes of low BPs to 80/50s.
   Likely from propofol effects / amiodarone therapy and his overall
   septic physiology.   Being treated for HAP. Responds well to pressor
   medications.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #6) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - f/up micro/ culture data, none positive so far
   - took 1.5 L off last night pre-bronch today so may need to ease up on
   lasix drip later today as long as MAPs appropriate
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone.  [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt, but per EP will likely just plan to switch to PO amiodarone
   as he has responded well to this therapy. Overnight still had several
   brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   - continue PO amiodarone with re-bolus PRN
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Improved now from 27-28 up to 30 range. [**Month (only) 51**] be stress
   gastritis. Hct has been stable, has not required transfusions since
   [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25
   - active T/S
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.8 range today . Likely elevated In
   setting of ongoing hypotension issues and probable element of recent
   ATN.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>50cc/hr) which has been good
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   --have been holding Plavix for past week for IP bronch/biopsy today
   - continue  ASA 81mg

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD) that underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and lung cancer with right upper lobe (RUL) lobectomy. He was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. The patient is currently awaiting an interventional procedure (IP) bronchoscopic biopsy for concern of recurrent lung cancer.

The patient has been experiencing occasional self-limited episodes of tachycardia, and diuresis with lasix has been initiated to achieve a negative fluid balance of -1.5 liters overnight. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/49 mmHg to 149/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with ventilatory support. The patient's physical examination reveals reactive pupils, good air movement, and bilateral rhonchi over the left side of the chest.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with decreased hematocrit and fibrinogen levels. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia new found to have new L lobe mass
   likely malignancy awaiting plavix washout for biopsy of mass in OR.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Multifactorial: baseline COPD, less
   lung volume on R and new L lung mass, volume overload with decreased
   compliance. Also has difficulty with secretions.
   - Hold on extubation due to inability to tolerate P/S. [**Month (only) 51**] have repeat
   bronch with biopsy as early as tomorrow (Tu) by IP
   - Continue diuresis by lasix gtt to goal 1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
 day#14 of predisone 20mg today,
   plan to switch to 10mg PO prednisone tomorrow [**5-6**]
   # L sided lung mass, concern for cancer recurrence
   - Plan for repeat bronch/biopsy tomorrow/Wed by IP
   - Hold TF after midnight in case procedure tomorrow
   # Hypotension: Likely component of hypotension from propofol. Also s/p
   septic physiology.   Being treated for HAP. Still pressor dependent.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #5) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   .- Follow up all pending micro/ culture data, none positive so far
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone. [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer with right upper lobe (RUL) lobectomy. He was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis, requiring intubation and vasopressors. The patient is currently awaiting an interventional procedure for a left-sided lung mass, which is suspected to be recurrent lung cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has difficulty with secretions, decreased lung volume due to the new left lung mass, and baseline COPD, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure. Measures such as diuresis and bronchoscopic interventions may be necessary.
2. Volume overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating volume overload. Diuretics (Lasix) are being used to manage this condition.
3. Hypotension: The patient is pressor-dependent and hypotensive, possibly due to septic physiology and propofol infusion. Vasopressors like neosynephrine are being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.
4. Atach/afib: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and amiodarone is being used for rate control. Quin"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia found to have new L lobe mass on
   recent bronchoscopy concerning for recurrent cancer & now awaiting IP
   repeat bronch/biopsy this morning
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Very poor reserve due to baseline
   COPD. He also had prior RUL lobectomy in
96 for lung cancer. On serial
   imaging he has less lung volume on R and now a newer L lung mass and
   respiratory failure with need for intubation despite multiple broad
   antibiotics.  He also has ongoing volume overload issue with decreased
   compliance overall making his ventilation in ICU challenging. Excessive
   secretions continue. Plan for IP bronch/biopsy today.
   - IP procedure with bronch/biopsy today
   - Holding on extubation due to inability to tolerate P/S
   - Continue diuresis by lasix gtt to goal -1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
 day#15 of predisone 20mg today,
   plan to switch to 10mg today
   # L sided lung mass:  major concern for cancer recurrence
   - follow-up results of repeat bronch/biopsy today by IP
   - Holding TF until after procedure done
   - d/w IP when safe to place back on Plavix ( if at all) after biopsy
   # Hypotension: Still having transient episodes of low BPs to 80/50s.
   Likely from propofol effects / amiodarone therapy and his overall
   septic physiology.   Being treated for HAP. Responds well to pressor
   medications.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #6) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - f/up micro/ culture data, none positive so far
   - took 1.5 L off last night pre-bronch today so may need to ease up on
   lasix drip later today as long as MAPs appropriate
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone.  [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt, but per EP will likely just plan to switch to PO amiodarone
   as he has responded well to this therapy. Overnight still had several
   brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   - continue PO amiodarone with re-bolus PRN
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Improved now from 27-28 up to 30 range. [**Month (only) 51**] be stress
   gastritis. Hct has been stable, has not required transfusions since
   [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25
   - active T/S
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.8 range today . Likely elevated In
   setting of ongoing hypotension issues and probable element of recent
   ATN.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>50cc/hr) which has been good
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and a previous right upper lobe lobectomy for lung cancer. He was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. The patient is currently awaiting an interventional procedure (IP) bronchoscopic biopsy to investigate a new left lung mass, which is concerning for recurrent lung cancer.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Due to the patient's baseline COPD and previous right upper lobe lobectomy, he has poor reserve and is at risk for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The ongoing volume overload and decreased lung compliance make ventilation challenging.

2. L-sided lung mass: The presence of a new left lung mass is concerning for cancer recurrence. The results of the repeat bronchoscopic biopsy will determine if this is indeed recurrent cancer.

3. Hypotension: The patient experiences transient episodes of low blood pressure, likely due to the effects of propofol and amiodarone therapy, as well as his overall septic physiology. He responds well to pressor medications and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia found to have new L lobe mass on
   recent bronchoscopy concerning for recurrent cancer & now awaiting IP
   repeat bronch/biopsy this morning
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Very poor reserve due to baseline
   COPD. He also had prior RUL lobectomy in
96 for lung cancer. On serial
   imaging he has less lung volume on R and now a newer L lung mass and
   respiratory failure with need for intubation despite multiple broad
   antibiotics.  He also has ongoing volume overload issue with decreased
   compliance overall making his ventilation in ICU challenging. Excessive
   secretions continue. Plan for IP bronch/biopsy today.
   - IP procedure with bronch/biopsy today
   - Holding on extubation due to inability to tolerate P/S
   - Continue diuresis by lasix gtt to goal -1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs
 day#15 today, plan to switch to
   10mg today ( down from 20mg)
   # L sided lung mass:  major concern for cancer recurrence
   - follow-up results of repeat bronch/biopsy today by IP
   - Holding TF until after procedure done
   - per IP
will be safe to place back on Plavix  about 24hrs after
   biopsy ( [**5-7**])
   # Hypotension: Still having transient episodes of low BPs to 80/50s.
   Likely from propofol effects / amiodarone therapy and his overall
   septic physiology.   Being treated for HAP. Responds well to pressor
   medications.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #6) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - f/up micro/ culture data, none positive so far
   - took 1.5 L off last night pre-bronch today so may need to ease up on
   lasix drip later today as long as MAPs appropriate and now CVPs
   trending < 5
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone.  [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt, but per EP will likely just plan to switch to PO amiodarone
   as he has responded well to this therapy. Overnight still had several
   brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   - continue PO amiodarone with re-bolus PRN
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Improved now from 27-28 up to 30 range. [**Month (only) 51**] be stress
   gastritis. Hct has been stable, has not required transfusions since
   [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25
   - active T/S
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.8 range today . Likely elevated In
   setting of ongoing hypotension issues and probable element of recent
   ATN.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>50cc/hr) which has been good
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   --have been holding Plavix for past week for IP bronch/biopsy today
   - continue  ASA 81mg

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer who was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis. He required intubation and pressors and is currently awaiting an intraoperative bronchoscopic biopsy for concern of recurrent lung cancer. The patient has had occasional episodes of tachycardia and has been on diuresis by Lasix gtt to goal -1L negative overnight. His total fluid output has been 2,727 mL with an input of 1,051 mL through TF, 1,505 mL through IVF, and a balance of -983 mL. He is receiving various medications including furosemide, phenylephrine, propofol, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has very poor reserve due to baseline COPD, prior right upper lobe (RUL) lobectomy, and decreased lung volume on the right side. He also has a new left lung mass, respiratory failure, and excessive secretions, making ventilation in the ICU challenging.
2. L-sided lung mass: There is a major concern for cancer recurrence, and the patient is awaiting the results of repeat bron"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. He was admitted with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. His hospital course has been notable for a new left upper lobe (LUL) mass concerning for carcinoma. He underwent bronchoscopy and biopsy this morning, which was well-tolerated with no bleeding. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely multifactorial related to MRSA pneumonia, recurrent lung cancer, and volume overload. He also has hypotension, atrial fibrillation/supraventricular tachycardia (AF/SVT), a drop in hematocrit (Hct), and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and may continue if not properly managed.
2. LUL mass: The biopsy results of the LUL mass need to be monitored, and further treatment decisions will depend on the findings.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sedation and the effects of the bronchoscopy procedure. Monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure support are necessary.
4. AF/SVT: The patient has been stable overall but has experienced transient tachycardic events with low blood pressure. Continuous monitoring and management with amiodarone are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for monitoring and management of various medical conditions. The patient underwent a biopsy with IP and is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/44 mmHg to 128/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 87.2 kg at admission to 85.5 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,567 mL, including 589 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 2,495 mL, primarily consisting of urine output. The patient's blood products and other fluid outputs are within normal limits.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 370 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The patient's respiratory status is assessed as stable with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, and electrolyte levels. However, the patient has elevated lactate levels at 36.2%, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is diagnosed with hypotension, delirium, pain control issues, atrial flutter, cellulitis, acute renal failure, other cardiomyopathy, septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and code status full code.

ICU Care:

The patient is receiving enteral nutrition through NovaSource Renal (Full) at a rate of 45 mL/hour. Glycemic control measures are in place, and the patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are also being implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently below the normal range, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which can be caused by various factors such as medication effects, infection, or other underlying medical conditions. It is important to address this issue promptly to prevent further complications.

3. Pain Control Issues: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain,"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia found to have new L lobe mass on
   recent bronchoscopy concerning for recurrent cancer & now awaiting IP
   repeat bronch/biopsy this morning
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Baseline COPD and s/p RUL lobectomy
   in
96 for lung cancer. On serial imaging he has less lung volume on R
   and now with a newer left sided lung mass which was biopsied with IP on
   [**5-6**].  Despite multiple antibiotics for PNA patient
s respiratory
   failure has required prolonged intubation.  Poor lung compliance,
   excessive secretions, and ongoing volume overload issues continue to
   challenge his ventilation in ICU. RSBI in low 100s this morning.
   - f/up IP bronch/biopsy  results
   - f/up ABG on current P/S settings
    -Continue diuresis by lasix gtt to goal -1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#16 today, down
   to 10mg daily )
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #7 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - CIS
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  major concern for cancer recurrence
   - follow-up results of repeat bronch/biopsy today by IP
   - place back on Plavix therapy today
   # Hypotension:  Better overnight.  He had some paralytics for IP
   procedure yesterday and was more heavily diuresed pre-procedure which
   likely  created his lower CVPs yesterday and low BPs.  Poor cardiac
   function, propofol effects / amiodarone therapy continue to add to his
   low BPs. Continues on current neosynephrine pressor  with goal MAPs >
   65.
   -
   - Continue neosynephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - PM CvO2 and lactate to ensure no ischemia w/ pressor
   - monitor I/Os, try to maintain UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs
   ( goal >[**5-29**]) & MAPs ( >65) ; may need to restart lasix drip later today
   if becomes too positive / overloaded
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone.  [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt, but per EP will likely just plan to switch to PO amiodarone
   as he has responded well to this therapy. Overnight still had several
   brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   - continue PO amiodarone with re-bolus PRN
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Stable now at 28 -30 range. [**Month (only) 51**] be stress gastritis. Has
   not required transfusions since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.6  range today ( has been 1.6-1.8 past
   few days)  . Likely elevated In setting of ongoing hypotension issues
   and probable element of recent  ATN earlier in ICU course.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>40cc/hr) which has been good
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   --have been holding Plavix for past week for IP bronch/biopsy today
   restart Plavix today
   - continue  ASA 81mg

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, h/o lung cancer, and CAD (s/p CABG) who was admitted with MRSA PNA and sepsis. He underwent intubation and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient is awaiting IP bronch/biopsy for concern for recurrent lung cancer. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 85/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 35%. The patient's RSBI is 104, indicating significant respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and previous right upper lobe lobectomy may contribute to poor lung compliance, excessive secretions, and ongoing volume overload issues, making ventilation challenging.
2. HAP (Hospital-acquired pneumonia): The patient has recently developed MRSA PNA and bacteremia, which requires continued antibiotic therapy with Zosyn and Vancomycin.
3. L-sided lung mass: The presence of a new left-sided lung mass raises concerns for cancer recurrence. The results of the repeat bronch/biopsy are pending.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely due to poor cardiac function, propofol effects, amiodarone therapy, and ongoing diuresis.

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and previous lung cancer with right upper lobe lobectomy. He was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis, requiring intubation and pressors. The patient is now awaiting an intraoperative repeat bronchoscopy and biopsy due to concern for recurrent lung cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has poor reserve due to baseline COPD and a prior right upper lobe lobectomy. He also has decreased lung volume on the right side and a new left lung mass. These factors make his ventilation in the ICU challenging, and excessive secretions continue.

2. L-sided lung mass: The presence of a new left lung mass is a major concern for cancer recurrence. Follow-up results of the repeat bronchoscopy and biopsy are pending.

3. Hypotension: The patient continues to have transient episodes of low blood pressure (80/50s). This is likely due to propofol effects/amiodarone therapy and overall septic physiology. The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and responds well to pressor medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer who was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis. He required intubation and pressors and is currently awaiting an interventional bronchoscopy and biopsy for concern of recurrent lung cancer. The patient has undergone a biopsy with intraoperative propagation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent lung cancer: The patient's history of lung cancer and the concern for recurrent lung cancer may pose a potential medical complication.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure, not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), could potentially worsen if there are complications during the bronchoscopy or if his underlying lung condition deteriorates.
3. Sepsis: Despite initial treatment, the patient remains at risk for sepsis due to his MRSA infection and compromised immune system.
4. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
5. Delirium/confusion: The patient's delirium/confusion may be attributed to sepsis, hypotension, or other factors, which need to be addressed to improve his mental status.
6. Pain control: The patient's acute and chronic pain need to be managed"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia found to have new L lobe mass on
   recent bronchoscopy concerning for recurrent cancer & now awaiting IP
   repeat bronch/biopsy this morning
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Baseline COPD and s/p RUL lobectomy
   in
96 for lung cancer. On serial imaging he has less lung volume on R
   and now with a newer left sided lung mass which was biopsied with IP on
   [**5-6**].  Despite multiple antibiotics for PNA patient
s respiratory
   failure has required prolonged intubation.  Poor lung compliance,
   excessive secretions, and ongoing volume overload issues continue to
   challenge his ventilation in ICU. RSBI in low 100s this morning.
   - f/up IP bronch/biopsy  results
   - f/up ABG on current P/S settings
    -Continue diuresis by lasix gtt to goal -1L negative today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#16 today, down
   to 10mg daily )
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #7 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - CIS
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  major concern for cancer recurrence
   - follow-up results of repeat bronch/biopsy today by IP
   - place back on Plavix therapy today
   # Hypotension:  Better overnight.  He had some paralytics for IP
   procedure yesterday and was more heavily diuresed pre-procedure which
   likely  created his lower CVPs yesterday and low BPs.  Poor cardiac
   function, propofol effects / amiodarone therapy continue to add to his
   low BPs. Continues on current phenylephrine pressor  with goal MAPs >
   65.
   -
   - Continue phenylephrine  to MAP>65, wean as tolerated
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - PM CvO2 and lactate to ensure no ischemia w/ pressor
   - monitor I/Os, try to maintain UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs
   ( goal >[**5-29**]) & MAPs ( >65) ; may need to restart lasix drip later today
   if becomes too positive / overloaded
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone.  [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt, but per EP will likely just plan to switch to PO amiodarone
   as he has responded well to this therapy. Overnight still had several
   brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   - continue PO amiodarone with re-bolus PRN
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Stable now at 28 -30 range. [**Month (only) 51**] be stress gastritis. Has
   not required transfusions since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.6  range today ( has been 1.6-1.8 past
   few days)  . Likely elevated In setting of ongoing hypotension issues
   and probable element of recent  ATN earlier in ICU course.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>40cc/hr) which has been good
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   --have been holding Plavix for past week for IP bronch/biopsy today
   restart Plavix today

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous right upper lobe (RUL) lobectomy for lung cancer. He was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis, requiring intubation and vasopressors. The patient is currently awaiting an intraoperative (IP) bronchoscopy and biopsy due to concern for recurrent lung cancer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline COPD and previous RUL lobectomy may contribute to this condition. The decreased lung volume on the right side and the presence of a new left-sided lung mass further complicate ventilation in the ICU.
2. HAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia): The patient has a recent history of MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. Ongoing treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin is necessary.
3. L-sided lung mass: The presence of a new left-sided lung mass raises concern for cancer recurrence. Follow-up results of the repeat bronchoscopic biopsy are pending.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to poor cardiac function, propofol effects, amiodarone therapy, and recent diuresis. Phenylephrine pressor is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65"

   L mass biopsy [**5-6**] pending
   All BCx no growth
   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of new L lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Multifactorial etiology. Baseline COPD and s/p
   RUL lobectomy in
96 for lung cancer. On serial imaging he has less
   lung volume on R and now with a newer left sided lung mass which was
   biopsied with IP on [**5-6**].  Despite multiple antibiotics for PNA
   patient
s respiratory failure has required prolonged intubation.  Poor
   lung compliance, excessive secretions, and ongoing volume overload
   issues continue to challenge his ventilation in ICU which we have been
   working to improve with diuresis, secretion control. RSBI in low 100s
   this morning but had tachycardia in SBT.
   - hold on extubation before clarify goals
   - f/up IP bronch/biopsy  results
   -Run his I/Os even today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#17 today, down
   to 10mg daily)
   - Talk to family regarding trach/PEG vs DNR/DNI status with trial of
   extubation
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #7 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - CIS
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  major concern for cancer recurrence
   - follow-up results of repeat bronch/biopsy today by IP
   # Hypotension:  Better overnight.  He had some paralytics for IP
   procedure yesterday and was more heavily diuresed pre-procedure which
   likely  created his lower CVPs yesterday and low BPs.  Poor cardiac
   function, propofol effects / amiodarone therapy continue to add to his
   low BPs. Were able to wean down off pressors this AM. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**2-25**]
   propofol hypotension so may still need low dose with re-sedation
   - Try to stay off pressors if possible, can do fluid boluses prn
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - monitor I/Os with goal even/slightly negative today, try to maintain
   UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs ( goal >7) & MAPs ( >65)
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone.  [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt, but per EP will likely just plan to switch to PO amiodarone
   as he has responded well to this therapy. Overnight still had several
   brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   - continue PO amiodarone with re-bolus PRN, especially when we trial
   extubation
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Stable now at 28 -30 range. [**Month (only) 51**] be stress gastritis. Has
   not required transfusions since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.6  range today ( has been 1.6-1.8 past
   few days)  . Likely elevated In setting of ongoing hypotension issues
   and probable element of recent  ATN earlier in ICU course.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>40cc/hr) which has been good
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - restarted on plavix yesterday, continue plavix
   - continue  ASA 81mg
   # Anxiety
 Patient with delirium/anxiety when not intubated last time.
   Psych was following prior for this
   - check EKG to see whether can use haldol prn (ie: 1mg PO Q8hr prn)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), COPD, and lung cancer (prior right upper lobe lobectomy) admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis. He required intubation and vasopressors and is currently awaiting an interventional bronchoscopic biopsy for concern of recurrent lung cancer. The patient's atrial fibrillation has improved overnight with no notable supraventricular tachycardia flare-ups. He underwent a biopsy with interventional procedures and was weaned off neosynephrine at 9 AM this morning. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume set at 370 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 35%. He is currently on amiodarone and propofol infusions. Other medications include piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and phenylephrine. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 81 beats per minute, blood pressure 85/44 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and previous right upper lobe lobectomy for lung cancer. He was admitted with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and sepsis, requiring intubation and vasopressors. He underwent an intraoperative bronchoscopy and biopsy for concern of recurrent lung cancer.

Current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 85/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient is currently receiving phenylephrine and propofol infusions.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Blood glucose levels are also elevated.

The patient's physical examination reveals reactive pupils with decreased extraocular movement, good air movement in the anterior chest, and bilateral rhonchi in the lungs. Cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm without murmurs or rubs. Abdominal examination is unremarkable.

Assessment and plan:
- Hypotension not in shock
- Delirium/confusion
- Pain control"

   1. Respiratory failure: much improved this morning, tolerated 1 hour
   SBT but then developed SVT at the end with HoTN requiring amiodarone
   bolus.  He still has some element of volume overload but overall
   secretions and infiltrate have improved
    - cont PSV with minimal settings, repeat SBT 0/0 x 30 min if fails
   then consider trach & PEG
    - cont to aim tbb even to negative 500 cc
    - cont steroid taper 10 mg

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and CAD. He presented with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia and was found to have a right upper lobe mass. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiac medications. He is also receiving nutritional support and has been placed on a ventilator due to respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently improving, but there is still an element of volume overload. It is important to continue monitoring his oxygenation and ventilation parameters, and adjust ventilator settings as necessary. If the patient fails a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may be considered.
2. Left Upper Lobe Mass: Further evaluation is needed for the pulmonary mass, including pathology results and staging CT scan. This will help determine the appropriate course of treatment.
3. MRSA Pneumonia/Bacteremia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin for MRSA infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of treatment failure or drug resistance. Cultures should be repeated to ensure clearance of the infection.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: Plavix should be held, and aspirin and beta-blocker therapy should be continued.
5. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SV"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of new L lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Extubated yesterday and has been stable off
   vent so far, still with high O2 requirement but weaning down. Will help
   his respiratory status by diuresis as CXR showing more fluid in lungs
   s/p extubation
   - run his I/Os negative today ( neg 1-2 L )
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#18 today, down
   to 10mg daily)
   - Talk to family regarding pathology results of squamous cell ca and
   goals of care/next steps
   # Delirium: Patient with delirium/anxiety when not sedated.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - check EKG / QT  today
   -consider using depakote
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #8 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - CIS
   - change Vanco to 1g q 24 hours
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer.
   - consider family meeting with goals of care changes
   - staging with CT studies once more stable
   -heme/onc consult today  & possibly RAD/Onc involvement
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - restarted on beta blocker and titrate up for now
   - restarted on plavix yesterday, continue plavix
   - continue  ASA 81mg
   - start ACE today or tomorrow as tolerated for afterload reduction
   #CHF:  recent EF 35%. Fluid overloaded on exam
   - consider starting ACE today or tomorrow, BP allowing
   -will diuresed to goal negative 1-2L today
   - keep MAPs >65
   # Hypotension:  Off pressors. Improved off propofol sedation
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - monitor I/Os with goal even/slightly negative today, try to maintain
   UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs ( goal >7) & MAPs ( >65)
   .
   # Atach/afib: Plan to continue on PO Amiodarone.  Overnight still had
   several brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   -continue lopressor 5mg q 4hrs for control
   - continue PO amiodarone
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Decreased to 26.[**5-26**] be stress gastritis. Has not
   required transfusions since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CKI : Cr still elevated at 1.6  range today ( has been 1.6-1.8 past
   few days)  . Likely elevated In setting of ongoing hypotension issues
   and probable element of recent  ATN earlier in ICU course. Given
   longevity this is likely CRF with new baseline vs. [**Last Name (un) **].

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer, and CAD (s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in the setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of a new left lobe mass.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable off vent so far, still with high O2 requirement but weaning down.
- The patient had a brief desaturation episode last night and required a face mask for oxygen supplementation.
- The patient experienced an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) after extubation, for which IVF bolus and amiodarone were administered. The patient still remains tachycardic and has been started on lopressor.
- The patient has had some fluctuations in blood pressure and requires close monitoring of I/Os with goal even/slightly negative today, trying to maintain UOP >30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs (goal >7) & MAPs (>65).
- The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires high flow oxygen.
- The patient's delirium/anxiety when not sedated is being managed with Haldol.
- The patient's recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia are being treated with Zosyn x 10 days total (day #8 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of new L lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Extubated yesterday. Multifactorial etiology.
   Baseline COPD and s/p RUL lobectomy in
96 for lung cancer. On serial
   imaging he has less lung volume on R and now with a newer left sided
   lung mass which was biopsied with IP on [**5-6**].  Despite multiple
   antibiotics for PNA patient
s respiratory failure has required
   prolonged intubation.  Poor lung compliance, excessive secretions, and
   ongoing volume overload issues continue to challenge his ventilation in
   ICU which we have been working to improve with diuresis, secretion
   control. RSBI in low 100s this morning but had tachycardia in SBT.
   - f/up IP bronch/biopsy  results
   -Run his I/Os even today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#18 today, down
   to 10mg daily)
   - Talk to family regarding trach/PEG vs DNR/DNI status with trial of
   extubation
   # Delirium
 Patient with delirium/anxiety when not sedated.
   - check EKG to see whether can use haldol prn per psych recs. Other
   recs from before include using depakote
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #8 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - CIS
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  major concern for cancer recurrence
   - follow-up rushed results of pathology
   # Hypotension:  Off pressors. Improved off propofol sedation
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - monitor I/Os with goal even/slightly negative today, try to maintain
   UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs ( goal >7) & MAPs ( >65)
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone.  [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt, but per EP will likely just plan to switch to PO amiodarone
   as he has responded well to this therapy. Overnight still had several
   brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   - continue PO amiodarone with re-bolus PRN, especially when we trial
   extubation
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Decreased to 26.[**5-26**] be stress gastritis. Has not
   required transfusions since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   # [**Last Name (un) **] : Cr still elevated at 1.6  range today ( has been 1.6-1.8 past
   few days)  . Likely elevated In setting of ongoing hypotension issues
   and probable element of recent  ATN earlier in ICU course.
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>40cc/hr) which has been good
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - restarted on plavix yesterday, continue plavix
   - continue  ASA 81mg

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer with right upper lobe (RUL) lobectomy, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia following a biopsy of a new left-sided lung mass.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and has been on invasive ventilation.
- He experienced multiple episodes of invasive ventilation stop, requiring reintubation.
- The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including baseline COPD and surgery-induced changes.
- He has been extubated but required reintubation due to ongoing volume overload issues and poor lung compliance.
- The patient has delirium/anxiety when not sedated.
- He has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, for which he is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.
- There is a concern for cancer recurrence on the left side.
- The patient has been hypotensive and required vasopressor support. His blood pressure has improved off pressors.
- He has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (afib) and is being treated with amiodarone.
- The patient has experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration, which may be due to stress gastritis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer with right upper lobe (RUL) lobectomy, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia following a biopsy of a new left-sided lung mass.

The patient has been intubated and on invasive ventilation, but has recently been extubated. He experienced supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) after extubation and received intravenous fluids (IVF) bolus and amiodarone. Despite this, he remained tachycardic, so lopressor was started at a dose of 5 mg IV every 6 hours. The patient also had a brief episode of desaturation in the high 80s with a respiratory rate in the 30s, for which a face mask was applied, and he recovered after suctioning.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 104/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmH"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of new L lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Extubated yesterday. Multifactorial etiology.
   Baseline COPD and s/p RUL lobectomy in
96 for lung cancer. On serial
   imaging he has less lung volume on R and now with a newer left sided
   lung mass which was biopsied with IP on [**5-6**].  Despite multiple
   antibiotics for PNA patient
s respiratory failure has required
   prolonged intubation.  Poor lung compliance, excessive secretions, and
   ongoing volume overload issues continue to challenge his ventilation in
   ICU which we have been working to improve with diuresis, secretion
   control. RSBI in low 100s this morning but had tachycardia in SBT.
   - f/up IP bronch/biopsy  results
   - run his I/Os negative today ( neg 1-2 L )
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#18 today, down
   to 10mg daily)
   - Talk to family regarding trach/PEG vs DNR/DNI status with trial of
   extubation
   # Delirium: Patient with delirium/anxiety when not sedated.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - check EKG / QT  today
   -consider using depakote
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #8 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - CIS
   - change Vanco to 1g q 24 hours
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer.
   - consider family meeting with goals of care changes
   - staging with CT studies once more stable
   -heme/onc consult today  & possibly RAD/Onc involvement
   # Hypotension:  Off pressors. Improved off propofol sedation
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - monitor I/Os with goal even/slightly negative today, try to maintain
   UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs ( goal >7) & MAPs ( >65)
   .
   # Atach/afib: Plan to continue on PO Amiodarone.  Overnight still had
   several brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as
   resolved  quickly. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to volume changes and increased
   diuresis.
   -continue lopressor 5mg q 4hrs for control
   - continue PO amiodarone
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Decreased to 26.[**5-26**] be stress gastritis. Has not
   required transfusions since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CKI : Cr still elevated at 1.6  range today ( has been 1.6-1.8 past
   few days)  . Likely elevated In setting of ongoing hypotension issues
   and probable element of recent  ATN earlier in ICU course. Given
   longevity this is likely CRF with new baseline vs. [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>40cc/hr) which has been good
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - restarted on plavix yesterday, continue plavix
   - continue  ASA 81mg
   #CHF:  recent EF 35%
   - consider starting ACE
   -will diuresed to goal negative 1-2L today
   - keep MAPs >65

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, and CAD (s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in the setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of a new L lobe mass. He has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to multifactorial respiratory failure, including poor lung compliance, excessive secretions, and ongoing volume overload. The patient's delirium/anxiety has been managed with Haldol, and he continues to receive multiple antibiotics for MRSA PNA. A biopsy of the left lung mass confirmed squamous cell lung cancer. The patient's hypotension has improved, and he is no longer on pressors. He is currently extubated and receiving oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's atach/afib is being managed with PO amiodarone, and he will continue to have close monitoring of his heart rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline COPD and previous right upper lobe lobectomy may contribute to his poor lung compliance and ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Delirium/Anxiety: The patient exhibits delirium/anxiety when not sedated, which requires ongoing management with Haldol. Regular assessment of his mental status is important to identify"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the hospital with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. On admission, his vital signs were stable, but he required immediate intubation due to respiratory distress. Since then, he has experienced several medical complications.

The patient's condition has been complicated by delirium, hypotension, pain control issues, atrial flutter, cellulitis, acute renal failure, other cardiomyopathy, septic shock, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, PaO2 of 240 mmHg, HCO3- of 31 mEq/L, BE of -9 mEq/L, and O2 saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory values show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 144 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 161 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L. The patient's platelet count is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is unresponsive and unable to assess his peripheral vascular status, skin condition, neurologic function, and tone. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg and requires ongoing respiratory support with high flow nebulization and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

The patient's current medications include amiodarone, lopressor, lorazepam, and heparin sodium. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and piperacillin.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, respiratory distress, sepsis, cardiac arrhythmias, and delirium. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, ABG results, laboratory values, and response to treatment in order to manage these complications effectively."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has a history of atrial flutter, chronic pain, cellulitis, and acute renal failure. He is currently on invasive ventilation and receiving various medications including antibiotics, antacids, antiarrhythmics, and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 104/46 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, along with decreased levels of hemoglobin and white blood cell count. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, PaO2 of 240 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 31 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination reveals absent peripheral pulses and poor skin turgor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating persistent hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of new L lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Extubated yesterday. Multifactorial etiology.
   Baseline COPD and s/p RUL lobectomy in
96 for lung cancer. On serial
   imaging he has less lung volume on R and now with a newer left sided
   lung mass which was biopsied with IP on [**5-6**].  Despite multiple
   antibiotics for PNA patient
s respiratory failure has required
   prolonged intubation.  Poor lung compliance, excessive secretions, and
   ongoing volume overload issues continue to challenge his ventilation in
   ICU which we have been working to improve with diuresis, secretion
   control. RSBI in low 100s this morning but had tachycardia in SBT.
   - f/up IP bronch/biopsy  results
   -Run his I/Os even today
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#18 today, down
   to 10mg daily)
   - Talk to family regarding trach/PEG vs DNR/DNI status with trial of
   extubation
   # Delirium
 Patient with delirium/anxiety when not sedated.
   - check EKG to see whether can use haldol prn per psych recs. Other
   recs from before include using depakote
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #8 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - CIS
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  major concern for cancer recurrence
   - follow-up rushed results of pathology
   # Hypotension:  Off pressors. Improved off propofol sedation
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - monitor I/Os with goal even/slightly negative today, try to maintain
   UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs ( goal >7) & MAPs ( >65)
   .
   # Atach/afib : Plan to continue on Amiodarone.  [**Month (only) 51**] switch to quinidine
   as outpt, but per EP will likely just plan to switch to PO amiodarone
   as he has responded well to this therapy. Overnight still had several
   brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer surgery (lobectomy), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia following a biopsy of a new left lung mass. The patient has been intubated and required prolonged mechanical ventilation due to poor lung compliance, excessive secretions, and volume overload issues. He was recently extubated but experienced tachycardia and desaturation, requiring the use of non-invasive ventilation support. The patient also had delirium and anxiety when not sedated. He has been diagnosed with recent MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia and is currently being treated with antibiotics. There is a major concern for cancer recurrence in the left-sided lung mass. The patient's hypotension has improved off pressors, and he is being monitored closely for fluid balance and electrolyte management. He is also being treated for atrial fibrillation with amiodarone. The patient's hematocrit level has decreased to 26%, likely due to stress gastritis, and he is being closely monitored for kidney function and urine output. His cardiac status, including a history of CAD and CABG, is stable at this time. The patient's family has been informed about the tracheostomy/PEG tube versus DNR/DNI status with a trial of extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and right upper lobe resection for SCLCA. He has been admitted with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, and now presents with a new lesion in the left upper lobe. The patient was extubated yesterday and tolerated well, but experienced brief tachycardia and hypoxemia overnight. He also became agitated and received haloperidol. The patient has multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, recurrent lung cancer, atrial tachycardia, CAD with CHF, delirium, hypotension, and CKD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further respiratory compromise due to his pre-existing conditions (COPD and CHF) and the presence of a new lung lesion. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.

2. Recurrent Lung Cancer: The new lesion in the left upper lobe suggests recurrent lung cancer. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Atrial Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial tachycardia and is currently in atrial fibrillation. These arrhythmias can lead to hemodynamic instability and complications such as heart failure.

4. Coronary Artery Disease with Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's history of CAD"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M COPD, CHF, RULectomy for SCLCA here with MRSA pna/bactermia and
   now found to have new LUL lesion
   1. Respiratory failure: stable s/p extubation with minimal secretions,
   likely [**2-25**] cardiogenic edema
    - cont aim tbb negative (1L)
    - cont aggressive pulmonary toilet including NT suctioning
    - cont prednisone 10 mg
   2. Recurrent lung CA:
    - will meet with wife and family regarding biopsy results and overall
   goals of care, he will need staging work-up
   3. Atrial Tachycardia, AFib
    - cont amiodarone
    - cont IV lopressor 5 mg q 4hr . consider initiating PO lopressor tid.
   4. CAD with CHF:
    - continue diuresis
    - cont lasix gtt aim - 1l for CVP </= 4
    - if bp remains stable would start captopril
    - cont asa/plavix
   5. Delirium:
    - haldol 2mg prn during the day and 3mg standing in afternoon as
   sundowning prophylaxis and daily ekg
   6. HoTN: much improved off propofol
    - will continue to treat tachycardia then address bp management
   7. Decreasing hct: cont guaiac stools, f/u hct

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of new L lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Extubated yesterday and has been stable off
   vent so far, still with high O2 requirement but weaning down. Will help
   his respiratory status by diuresis as CXR showing more fluid in lungs
   s/p extubation
   - run his I/Os negative today ( neg 1-2 L )
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#18 today, down
   to 10mg daily)
   - Talk to family regarding pathology results of squamous cell ca and
   goals of care/next steps
   # Delirium: Patient with delirium/anxiety when not sedated.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - check EKG / QT  today
   -consider using depakote
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - continue Zosyn x 10 days total (day #8 today) and IV Vanco x 6 weeks
   - CIS
   - change Vanco to 1g q 24 hours
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer.
   - consider family meeting with goals of care changes
   - staging with CT studies once more stable
   -heme/onc consult today  & possibly RAD/Onc involvement
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - restarted on beta blocker and titrate up for now
   - restarted on plavix yesterday, continue plavix
   - continue  ASA 81mg
   - start ACE today or tomorrow as tolerated for afterload reduction
   #CHF:  recent EF 35%. Fluid overloaded on exam
   - consider starting ACE today or tomorrow, BP allowing
   -will diuresed to goal negative 1-2L today
   - keep MAPs >65
   # Hypotension:  Off pressors. Improved off propofol sedation
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - monitor I/Os with goal even/slightly negative today, try to maintain
   UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs ( goal >7) & MAPs ( >65)
   .
   # Atach/afib: Plan to continue on PO Amiodarone.  Overnight still had
   several brief runs of SVT but no need for any re-bolus of amiodarone as

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer with right upper lobe lobectomy, and coronary artery disease (s/p CABG). The patient was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia following a biopsy of a new left lobe mass.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm with a range of 80-106 bpm, blood pressure of 126/52 mmHg with a range of 76-131/44-80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute with a range of 20-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient is extubated and stable off the ventilator but still requires a high O2 requirement. He is being weaned down slowly as tolerated. The physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles and anterior rhonchi in the lungs, jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 8 cm, regular heart sounds with no murmurs, and no overt signs of distress.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 27.2 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.6 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 0.9 mmol/L. The patient has an elevated potassium level of 5."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer with right upper lobe lobectomy, and coronary artery disease (s/p CABG). He was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia following a biopsy of a new left lobe mass. The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable off the ventilator so far, still requiring high oxygen but weaning down. The assessment includes respiratory failure, delirium, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), left-sided lung mass, coronary artery disease (CAD) post CABG, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/VR), and a drop in hemoglobin concentration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable as indicated by the need for high oxygen requirement. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if weaning off the ventilator is unsuccessful.
2. Delirium: The patient continues to experience delirium/anxiety when not sedated. This can lead to agitation, confusion, and increased risk of falls or self-harm.
3. Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has a recent history of MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. There is a risk of recurrent or resistant infections if appropriate antibiotics are not administered.
4. Left-Sided Lung Mass: The patient has a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and SCLCA who presented with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. He was found to have recurrent left upper lobe lung cancer. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure due to volume overload, COPD, and improving pneumonia. He also has confusion, squamous cell carcinoma, atrial tachycardia, acute-on-chronic renal failure (likely pre-renal), and feeding intolerance.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of COPD, further decline in renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility, and worsening of the underlying lung cancer.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, adjust diuretic therapy as needed, ensure adequate fluid balance, provide appropriate pain and symptom management, and consider further interventions for the recurrent lung cancer."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and previous surgery for SCLCA. He presented with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia and was found to have recurrent left upper lobe lung cancer. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to volume overload and improving pneumonia, confusion, squamous cell carcinoma, atrial tachycardia, acute on chronic renal failure (likely pre-renal), and feeding tube intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of volume overload, COPD, and improving pneumonia. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Confusion: The patient's confusion may worsen if he does not receive his standing haldol overnight, and he may also demonstrate significant agitation.
3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The patient has recurrent LUL lung cancer. Further complications can arise from the progression of the cancer, including spread to other organs and difficulty with breathing.
4. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has atrial tachycardia, which may increase the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac complications if not properly managed with medications such as amiodarone and lopressor.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure (AoCRF): The patient has likely pre-renal AoCRF, which could lead to further kidney dysfunction and electrolyte im"

   diagnosis s/p recent biopsy of  left  lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Extubated >48hrs ago and has been stable off vent so far, still with
   significant O2 requirements but weaning down gradually. Yesturday
   patient had worse fluid overload on  CXR so he was diuresed more
   aggressively

   - check EKG / QT  today
   - keep O2 sats around 90-92%
   - wean steroids to off
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer.
   - family meeting done yesterday and goals of care changed to DNR/DNI
   - f/up palliative care team recs
   - will discuss with family whether further onc evaluation desired
   - social work involved
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue [**Year (4 digits) **], plavix  BB
   # CHF, systolic, chronic:  recent EF 35%. Patient more euvolemic today
   -  continue BB
   - I/o goal as above
   - consider ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib:
   - continue amiodarone and metoprolol
   - monitoring on tele
   - follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia
    Has been stable [**Month (only) 51**] be stress gastritis. Has not required transfusions
   since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with hypoxia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient now has a recurrence of lung cancer, confirmed by biopsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has significant oxygen requirements and is being weaned off ventilatory support. He needs close monitoring to prevent re-intubation and ensure adequate oxygenation.
2. Delirium: The patient remains intermittently confused, which could be due to delirium. It is important to manage his delirium by providing frequent reorientation, maintaining sleep-wake cycles, and using appropriate medications such as haloperidol while monitoring for side effects like QT prolongation.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, which needs to be monitored, and transfusions should be given as necessary to maintain a hematocrit level above 25, especially considering his history of CAD.
4. Chronic Kidney Injury (CRI): The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated today, possibly due to aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is required to manage CRI.
5. Cardiovascular Issues: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer (right upper lobe lobectomy), and CAD (post coronary artery bypass grafting). He was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia following a biopsy of a new left lobe mass.

The patient has been extubated for over 48 hours and is stable off the ventilator, but still requires high oxygen supplementation. The plan is to continue weaning him off oxygen. A chest X-ray shows more fluid in the lungs post-extubation, so diuresis will be helpful in his respiratory status.

The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, delirium, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), left-sided lung mass, CAD, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and stress gastritis. 

Treatment plans include running his inputs and outputs negative, continuing steroid taper and MDIs, discussing pathology results and goals of care with the family, reassessing delirium, checking ABG, considering using depakote, and monitoring O2 saturations.

Medications include IV Vancomycin and Piperacillin-tazobactam, which will be discontinued today. Other medications include Heparin sodium (prophylaxis), Furosemide (Lasix), Haloperidol (Haldol), Metoprolol, and others as per the ICU care plan.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities, indicating possible kidney dysfunction and ongoing infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on high flow oxygen, which increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and impaired gas exchange. Close monitoring of respiratory status and gradual weaning off oxygen is crucial.

2. Delirium: The patient exhibits delirium and anxiety when not sedated. Reassessing the patient's mental status and adjusting medication dosages (particularly antipsychotics) is essential to prevent further complications like falls or worsening agitation.

3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. Discontinuing unnecessary antibiotics and implementing strict infection control measures are important to prevent further infections.

4. Left-Sided Lung Mass: The patient has a confirmed squamous cell lung cancer. Staging with CT studies once more stable and discussing treatment options with the family is necessary to manage the cancer progression.

5. CAD, s/p CABG: The patient's coronary artery disease and recent CABG surgery put him at risk for cardiac complications. Monitoring the patient's cardiac status, restarting beta-blockers, and maintaining optimal blood pressure control are essential.

6. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's recent ejection fraction of 35% indicates reduced cardiac function. Monitoring fluid balance, using diuretics, and"

   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CKI : Cr still elevated at 1.6  range today ( has been 1.6-1.8 past
   few days)  . Likely in setting of diuresis. However, this may be a new
   chronic RF baseline for him.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and prior lung cancer requiring lobectomy. He was admitted with hypoxia due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient now has a recurrent lung cancer diagnosis confirmed by recent biopsy of the left lobe mass. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient still has high O2 requirements despite being extubated over 48 hours ago. There is a concern for pulmonary overload, as indicated by worsening pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Diuretics have been used aggressively, and the patient's I/Os are being monitored with a goal of negative 500cc to maintain a UOP of more than 30cc/hr.
2. Delirium: The patient exhibits delirium/anxiety when not sedated. Haloperidol has been prescribed for symptom management, and an EKG to check QT interval will be done today. Depakote may be considered for treatment.
3. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP): The patient has recently had MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. He has completed a 10-day course of Zosyn and is now continuing IV Vancomycin for six weeks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and organ function. The patient's DNR/DNI status was updated, and palliative care was requested. Central line complications and replacement of the Dopamine pump occurred. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin) and various ICU medications, including heparin sodium, furosemide, haloperidol, and metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 120/52 mmHg and low oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 89%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. The patient's heart rhythm is paced, and there is no assessment of peripheral vascular pulses or neurologic status.

Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 172 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) level at 8.7 g/dL, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 113 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.9 mg/dL. Other lab values show abnormalities in electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical complications, including impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia s/p biopsy of new L lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Extubated >48hrs ago and has been stable off
   vent so far, still with high O2 requirement but weaning down. Will help
   his respiratory status by diuresis as CXR showing more fluid in lungs
   s/p extubation.
   - run his I/Os negative today
 run him even to -500cc today
   - DC lasix gtt
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#18 today, down
   to 10mg daily)  - keep at 10mg for now as patient still with wheezing
   - Talk to family regarding pathology results of squamous cell ca and
   goals of care/next steps
   - make sure on standing nebs
   # Delirium: Patient with delirium/anxiety when not sedated. Reassess in
   afternoon, check ABG.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - check EKG / QT  today
   -consider using depakote
   - check ABG
   - keep O2 sats around 90-92%
   #HAP : Recent MRSA PNA and bacteremia. No recent fevers or
   leukocytosis.
   - patient has been on Zosyn x 10 days total (day #9 today) and IV Vanco
   x 6 weeks
 DC zosyn today
   - CIS
   .
   # L sided lung mass:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer.
   - family meeting today with goals of care changes
   - staging with CT studies once more stable
   - social work involved
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - restarted on beta blocker and titrate up for now
   - restarted on plavix yesterday, continue plavix
   - continue  ASA 81mg
   - start ACE when Cr improved tolerated for afterload reduction
 or can
   try hydral
   #CHF:  recent EF 35%. Patient more euvolemic today
   - consider starting ACE today or tomorrow, BP allowing
   - keep MAPs >65
   # Hypotension:  Off pressors. Improved off propofol sedation
   - f/up micro/ culture data
   - monitor I/Os with goal even/slightly negative today, try to maintain
   UOP > 30cc/hr with close watch on CVPs ( goal >7) & MAPs ( >65)
   .
   # Atach/afib: On IV Amiodarone while no POs
   -continue lopressor 5mg q 4hrs for control
   - continue amiodarone
   -cont telemetry
   -follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   #HCT Drop :  Has been stable [**Month (only) 51**] be stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CKI : Cr still elevated at 1.8  range today ( has been 1.6-1.8 past
   few days)  . Likely in setting of diuresis
   - Repeat PM lytes
   - Follow urine output (keep UOP>40cc/hr) which has been good

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and previous SCLC who presented with MRSA bacteremia and pna. He was found to have recurrent left upper lobe lung cancer. The patient is currently in respiratory failure due to volume overload, COPD, and improving pneumonia. He is being treated with diuretics, antibiotics, and respiratory support.

The patient also has confusion, which is somewhat improved, and he is being given Haldol. He has newly diagnosed recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma and is being considered for staging evaluation if he improves. The patient is also experiencing atrial tachycardia and is being treated with amiodarone and lopressor.

Additionally, the patient has acute on chronic renal failure with mildly elevated creatinine levels. He is being monitored closely, and the rest of the plan is per resident note. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of volume overload, COPD, and improving pneumonia. The main complication to watch out for is worsening respiratory status, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of vital signs, particularly respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure, is essential. Frequent assessments of lung sounds and chest"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and SCLC who presented with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. He was found to have recurrent left upper lobe lung cancer. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to volume overload and improving pneumonia, confusion, squamous cell carcinoma recurrence, atrial tachycardia, acute on chronic renal failure, and fecal occult blood. The patient has been diuresed well using lasix PRN, and his TBB goal is even slightly negative today. He is being continued on vancomycin for a total of 6 weeks, completing a 10-day Zosyn course. His respiratory sounds are clearer today, and he will continue with prednisone taper and standing nebs. The target SaO2 range is 88-92%. His confusion has somewhat improved, and he is now being given Haldol. The newly diagnosed recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma will be evaluated for staging if he improves from his current status. The atrial tachycardia will continue to be managed with amiodarone and lopressor. The patient's creatinine levels are stably mildly elevated, and he will continue to be monitored in the context of diuresis. He has started total parenteral nutrition (TF) via Dobhoff. The rest of the plan is per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and prior non-small cell lung cancer (NSLC). He was admitted with hypoxia due to MRSA pneumonia with bacteremia and now has a recurrence of lung cancer. The patient received 40 IV lasix overnight and became agitated, but responded to Haldol. His EKG showed normal QT interval. The patient has no known drug allergies. He received Piperacillin and Vancomycin at different times. He is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for new developments. Flow sheet data shows vital signs within normal range, with a slight variation in blood pressure. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support and has a SpO2 of 96%. ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient's uncooperative behavior. Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Chest X-rays from different times show worsening lung infiltrates. Assessment and plan include various impairments in different body systems, including endurance, arousal, attention, and cognition, balance, respiration, hypotension, delirium, pain control, atrial flutter, cellulitis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with hypoxia in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient now has a recurrence of lung cancer, confirmed by recent biopsy of the left lobe mass.

The patient's recent events include being extubated three days ago and being stable off the ventilator so far. He has been diuresed aggressively overnight for recent fluid overload. The plan is to continue steroid taper, wean oxygen as tolerated, and keep up with nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers. The patient and family have decided against re-intubation if he decompensates.

The patient remains very confused intermittently and has delirium with limited response to Haldol. The plan is to continue Haldol, add Seroquel at bedtime, monitor EKG and QT interval, maintain oxygen saturation above 90%, and wean steroids.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%. He is on beta-blockers and will be uptitrated as tolerated. The goal is to maintain even input/output and check postmortem electrolytes. Consideration will be given to starting an ACE inhibitor when creatinine levels are"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia and now has recurrent lung cancer
   diagnosis s/p recent biopsy of  left  lobe mass.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Extubated >48hrs ago and has been stable off vent so far, still with
   significant O2 requirements but weaning down gradually. Yesturday
   patient had worse fluid overload on  CXR so he was diuresed more
   aggressively
   - run even today
   - lasix gtt only PRN , keeping UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue steroid taper and MDIs  ( PO prednisone
 day#19 today, down
   to 10mg daily)  - keep at 10mg for now as patient still with wheezing
   - continue  on standing nebs
   - wean FiO2 as tolerates , patient and family now decided do not want
   re-intubation if he decompensates to that point
   # Delirium
   Remains confused intermittently c/w delirium
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - check EKG / QT  today
   - keep O2 sats around 90-92%
   - wean steroids to off
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer.
   - family meeting done yesterday and goals of care changed to DNR/DNI
   - f/up palliative care team recs
   - will discuss with family whether further onc evaluation desired
   - social work involved
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # CHF, systolic, chronic:  recent EF 35%. Patient more euvolemic today
   -  continue BB
   - I/o goal as above
   - consider ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib:
   - continue amiodarone and metoprolol
   - monitoring on tele
   - follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. He presented with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia and was found to have recurrent left upper lobe lung cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to volume overload, COPD exacerbation, and improving pneumonia. He is delirious and experiencing difficulty sleeping.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has volume overload, COPD exacerbation, and improving pneumonia. The plan includes continuing nebs, leaving him on 5mg of prednisone, continuing vancomycin for a total of 6 weeks, and aiming for SaO2 between 88-92%.

2. Confusion: The patient was more delirious yesterday and has difficulty sleeping. The plan includes continuing with Haldol and adding QHS seroquel to assist with sundowning/insomnia.

3. Squamous cell carcinoma: The patient has a newly diagnosed recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. If he is able to improve from his current status, a staging evaluation will be considered.

4. Atrial tachycardia: The patient will continue on amiodarone and lopressor for his atrial tachycardia.

5. Acute on chronic renal failure (AoCRF): The patient's creatinine levels are stably mildly elevated, and he will continue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and previous squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. He presented with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia and was found to have recurrent lung cancer. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to volume overload and improving pneumonia. He is also confused and delirious, with difficulty sleeping. Additionally, he has a newly diagnosed recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. The patient has atrial tachycardia and mildly elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible acute-on-chronic renal failure. He is receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including antibiotics, antipsychotic medication, cardiac medications, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to volume overload and COPD. The main concern here is the potential worsening of respiratory function, which could lead to further respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Confusion/Delirium: The patient's confusion and delirium pose a risk of falls, self-removal of lines/tubes, and difficulty with weaning off sedation. Delirium can also complicate the assessment of the patient's mental status and overall clinical condition.

3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Recurrence: The newly diagnosed recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma indicates a poor prognosis and potential complications related to cancer progression, such as weight loss, anorexia, fatigue,"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia and now has recurrent lung cancer
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient was extubated  4 days ago and has been
   stable breathing off of the vent so far, weaning his O2 requirements
   slowly. Overnight he had some desaturations and needed to be switched
   from nasal cannula to face mask.  He continue to require additional
   Lasix boluses to for ongoing diureses of his mild fluid overloaded
   status.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , will taper diuresis today with goal I/O
   -500cc
   - Continue steroid taper / now 5mg daily prednisone  ( day#21 today)  -
   still with wheezing so will slowly taper
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - wean O2 as tolerates  ( on facemask now) , patient and family now
   decided do not want re-intubation if he decompensates to that point
   # Delirium:  Overnight he remains very confused intermittently c/w
   delirium and having only limited response to Haldol still. Patient
   pulled out his dobhoff  feeding tube last night.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis trial and will consider additional Seroquel HS
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - keep O2 sats  > 90% to avoid any hypoxia effects
   - wean steroids , now down to 5mg qdaily
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer. Per ecent family meetings, goals of care changed to
   DNR/DNI and optimizing patients comfort levels.
   - f/up palliative care team recs
 will be by to see team on Tuesday
   - will discuss with family whether further oncology palliative
   therapies/workup for more staging is desired
   - social work involved / f/up notes and recs
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # systolic CHF:  recent EF 35% on ECHO. Patient has slightly increased
   volume today with overnight 24h I/O positive 600cc.
   -f/up CXR today
   -continue BB, uptitrate as tolerates
   -continue with additional diuresis w/Lasix and goal I/O slightly
   negative today
   - checking PM lytes
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - continue metoprolol TID, uptitrate as tolerates
   - holding off on standing Amiodarone given concern for pulmonary
   fibrosis ; readdress risk vs. benefit
   - monitoring on tele
   - follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   - continue on PPI
   - will trend HCTs daily  keep >25 given CAD history
   - make sure updated  active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CRI :
   Cr slightly up today in setting of diuresis
   - continue to follow urine output, Cr

   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia and now has recurrent lung cancer
   which continued hypoxemia and delirium.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Respiratory status worsened overnight.
   Multifactorial with wheezes consistent with worsened COPD, increased
   fluid, with baseline poor lung function, low lung volumes.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , aim for diuresis today with goal I/O -500cc.
   Will give 40mg IV lasix now, if still with air hunger, give 0.5mg IV
   morphine
   - if no improvement, increase steroids back up to prednisone 40mg daily
   (has been on 5mg prednisone of long steroid taper)
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - aim for O2 sat 90-95%
   # Delirium:  Less delirium overnight.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis trial and will consider additional Seroquel HS if able
   to take POs
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer. Per recent family meetings, goals of care changed to
   DNR/DNI and optimizing patients comfort levels.
   - f/up palliative care team recs
 will be by to see team on Tuesday in
   person.
   - will discuss with family whether further oncology palliative
   therapies/workup for more staging is desired
   - social work involved / f/up notes and recs
   # Goals of care: Per meeting with family on Friday
 plan was to focus
   on nutrition and delirium over weekend. However, if no improvement, may
   need to focus more on comfort.  Also consider whether patient could
   transfer somewhere closer to family
   - talk to family today with update/readdress goals in setting of
   worsened respiratory status
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # systolic CHF:  recent EF 35% on ECHO. Patient has slightly increased
   volume today with overnight 24h I/O positive 600cc.
   -f/up CXR today
   -continue BB
   -continue with additional diuresis w/Lasix and goal I/O -500ml today
   - checking PM lytes
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - continue metoprolol TID IV, uptitrate as tolerates
   - continue amiodarone IV gtt (equivalent of 40
   - monitoring on tele
   - follow K, Mg  PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   - continue on PPI
   - will trend HCTs daily  keep >25 given CAD history
   - make sure updated active T/S

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, previous lung cancer surgery, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia.
- The patient now has recurrent lung cancer, which continues to cause hypoxemia and delirium.
- The patient's respiratory status worsened overnight, possibly due to worsened COPD, increased fluid intake, and baseline poor lung function.
- The plan is to keep the patient's urine output greater than 30cc/hr and aim for diuresis today with a goal of input/output balance of -500cc.
- If the patient still experiences air hunger, 0.5mg IV morphine may be given.
- If there is no improvement, steroids may be increased back up to prednisone 40mg daily.
- The patient will continue to receive standing nebs and MDIs, with an increase in nebs overnight.
- The goal is to maintain an oxygen saturation level of 90-95%.
- The patient's delirium has improved overnight, and Haldol will continue to be administered at a dose of 3mg qpm and 1-2mg PRN q8hrs during the daytime.
- Zydis will be continued, and additional Seroquel may be considered if the patient is able to take oral medications.
- The patient's EKG and QT interval will be monitored"

   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia and now has recurrent lung cancer
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient was extubated  4 days ago and has been
   stable breathing off of the vent so far, weaning his O2 requirements
   slowly. Overnight he had some desaturations and needed to be switched
   from nasal cannula to face mask.  He continue to require additional
   Lasix boluses to for ongoing diureses of his mild fluid overloaded
   status.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , will taper diuresis today with goal I/O
   -500cc
   - Continue steroid taper / now 5mg daily prednisone  ( day#21 today)  -
   still with wheezing so will slowly taper
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - wean O2 as tolerates  ( on facemask now) , patient and family now
   decided do not want re-intubation if he decompensates to that point
   # Delirium:  Overnight he remains very confused intermittently c/w
   delirium and having only limited response to Haldol still. Patient
   pulled out his dobhoff  feeding tube last night.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis trial and will consider additional Seroquel HS
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - keep O2 sats  > 90% to avoid any hypoxia effects
   - wean steroids , now down to 5mg qdaily
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed

   -continue with additional diuresis w/Lasix and goal I/O slightly
   negative today
   - checking PM lytes
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - continue metoprolol TID, uptitrate as tolerates
   - holding off on standing Amiodarone given concern for pulmonary
   fibrosis ; readdress risk vs. benefit
   - monitoring on tele
   - follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) recurrence. He was admitted with hypoxia in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, delirium, NSCLC recurrence, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), anemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires additional Lasix boluses to manage ongoing fluid overload and continues to need nebs and MDIs. O2 weaning should be done slowly, and the patient's decision against re-intubation should be respected.
2. Delirium: The patient remains confused and intermittently delirious. Haldol dosage will be increased, and other measures such as reorientation, enforcing sleep/wake cycles, light restraints, and considering additional Seroquel HS will be implemented.
3. NSCLC recurrence: The patient has confirmed squamous cell lung cancer recurrence. Goals of care have changed to do-not-resuscitate (DNR)/do-not-intubate (DNI), with a focus on optimizing patient comfort. Palliative care consultation is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted with hypoxia and found to have MRSA pneumonia with bacteremia. Now, there is a recurrence of his lung cancer. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, respiratory support with high flow nebulizers, and intravenous medications. His vital signs are stable, but he has an increased heart rate. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,847 mL and output of 1,209 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 638 mL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's severe COPD and recurrent lung cancer, he is at high risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and CABG puts him at risk for cardiovascular complications like myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart failure, and unstable angina.

3. Infection-related Complications: With the recurrence of lung cancer and previous MRSA infection, the patient is susceptible to further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bloodstream infections, and sepsis.

4. Thromboembolic Complications: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia and now has recurrent lung cancer
   .
   # Respiratory failure:
   Extubated  3  days ago and has been stable off vent so far, weaning
   his  O2 requirements  slowly.  He had been diuresed aggressively
   overnight for recent fluid overload.
   - run even today
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , will taper diuresis today
   - Continue steroid taper / now 5mg daily prednisone  ( PO prednisone
   day#20 today, down to 5mg daily)  - keep at 5 mg for now as patient
   still with wheezing
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs
   - wean O2 as tolerates  ( on 5L NC now) , patient and family now
   decided do not want re-intubation if he decompensates to that point
   # Delirium:  Remains very confused intermittently c/w delirium and
   having only limited response to Haldol now.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - will plan to add Seroquel HS to regimen
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - keep O2 sats  > 90% to avoid any hypoxia effects
   - wean steroids , now down to 5mg qdaily
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer.
   - family meeting done yesterday and goals of care changed to DNR/DNI
   - f/up palliative care team recs
 will be by to see team on Tuesday
   - will discuss with family whether further onc evaluation desired
   - social work involved
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # CHF, systolic, chronic:  recent EF 35%. Patient more negative today
   - continue BB, uptitrate as tolerates
   -goal I/O even, checking PM lytes
   - consider ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib:
   - continue metoprolol TID, uptitrate as tolerates
   - holding off on Amiodarone given concern for pulmonary fibrosis
   - monitoring on tele
   - follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia
    Has been stable [**Month (only) 51**] be stress gastritis. Has not required transfusions
   since [**5-2**].
   -will trend HCTs [**Hospital1 7**], keep >25 given CAD history
   - active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CRI :
   Cr slightly up today in setting of diuresis
   - continue to follow urine output, Cr

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with hypoxia in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia. Now, he has been found to have a recurrence of his lung cancer. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, delirium, NSCLC recurrence, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical condition that requires close monitoring and management. He has been extubated and stable off the ventilator so far, but weaning of oxygen requirements should be done slowly. Aggressive diuresis has been initiated for recent fluid overload, and fluid balance needs to be carefully managed to prevent further complications.
2. Delirium: The patient remains very confused and intermittently delirious, which is concerning. Delirium management should involve the use of antipsychotics like Haldol, reorientation, ensuring sleep/wake cycles, light restraints if needed, and avoiding hypoxia.
3. NSCLC Recurrence: The patient has confirmed squamous cell lung cancer recurrence. Goals of care have been changed to"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia and now has recurrent lung cancer
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Patient was extubated  4 days ago and has been
   stable breathing off of the vent so far, weaning his O2 requirements
   slowly. Overnight he had some desaturations and needed to be switched
   from nasal cannula to face mask.  He continue to require additional
   Lasix boluses to for ongoing diureses of his mild fluid overloaded
   status.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , will taper diuresis today with goal I/O
   -500cc
   - Continue steroid taper / now 5mg daily prednisone  ( day#21 today)  -
   still with wheezing so will slowly taper
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - wean O2 as tolerates  ( on facemask now) , patient and family now
   decided do not want re-intubation if he decompensates to that point
   # Delirium:  Overnight he remains very confused intermittently c/w
   delirium and having only limited response to Haldol still. Patient
   pulled out his dobhoff  feeding tube last night.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis trial and will consider additional Seroquel HS
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - keep O2 sats  > 90% to avoid any hypoxia effects
   - wean steroids , now down to 5mg qdaily
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer. Per ecent family meetings, goals of care changed to
   DNR/DNI and optimizing patients comfort levels.
   - f/up palliative care team recs
 will be by to see team on Tuesday
   - will discuss with family whether further oncology palliative
   therapies/workup for more staging is desired
   - social work involved / f/up notes and recs
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # systolic CHF:  recent EF 35% on ECHO. Patient has slightly increased
   volume today with overnight 24h I/O positive 600cc.
   -f/up CXR today
   -continue BB, uptitrate as tolerates
   -continue with additional diuresis w/Lasix and goal I/O slightly
   negative today
   - checking PM lytes
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - continue metoprolol TID, uptitrate as tolerates
   - holding off on standing Amiodarone given concern for pulmonary
   fibrosis ; readdress risk vs. benefit
   - monitoring on tele
   - follow K, Mg   PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   - continue on PPI
   - will trend HCTs daily  keep >25 given CAD history
   - make sure updated  active T/S
   - guaiac stools

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with hypoxia in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia (MRSA PNA) and bacteremia. The patient now has recurrent lung cancer.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require additional Lasix boluses to manage ongoing diuresis due to mild fluid overload. He remains on a face mask for oxygen delivery and requires nebulizers and metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) for respiratory support. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.

2. Delirium: The patient remains very confused and exhibits delirium, with intermittent limited response to haloperidol (Haldol). Delirium poses a risk for increased agitation, falls, and complications related to immobility.

3. Sepsis: The patient had MRSA PNA and bacteremia upon admission, indicating a systemic infection. There is a risk of sepsis recurrence or development of new infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression from steroids and potential feeding tube-related infections.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan:
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia and now has recurrent lung cancer
   which continued hypoxemia and delirium.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Respiratory status worsened overnight.
   Multifactorial with wheezes consistent with worsened COPD, increased
   fluid, with baseline poor lung function, low lung volumes.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , aim for diuresis today with goal I/O -500cc.
   Will give 40mg IV lasix now, if still with air hunger, give 0.5mg IV
   morphine
   - if no improvement, increase steroids back up to prednisone 40mg daily
   (has been on 5mg prednisone of long steroid taper)
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - aim for O2 sat 90-95%
   # Delirium:  Less delirium overnight.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis trial and will consider additional Seroquel HS if able
   to take POs
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer. Per recent family meetings, goals of care changed to
   DNR/DNI and optimizing patients comfort levels.
   - f/up palliative care team recs
 will be by to see team on Tuesday in
   person.
   - will discuss with family whether further oncology palliative
   therapies/workup for more staging is desired
   - social work involved / f/up notes and recs
   # Goals of care: Per meeting with family on Friday
 plan was to focus
   on nutrition and delirium over weekend. However, if no improvement, may
   need to focus more on comfort.  Also consider whether patient could
   transfer somewhere closer to family
   - talk to family today with update/readdress goals in setting of
   worsened respiratory status
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # systolic CHF:  recent EF 35% on ECHO. Patient has slightly increased
   volume today with overnight 24h I/O positive 600cc.
   -f/up CXR today
   -continue BB
   -continue with additional diuresis w/Lasix and goal I/O -500ml today
   - checking PM lytes
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - continue metoprolol TID IV, uptitrate as tolerates
   - continue amiodarone drip , transition to PO 400 BID once completed
   - follow K, Mg  PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   - continue on PPI
   - will trend HCTs daily  keep >25 given CAD history
   - make sure updated active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CRI : Trending downwards
   - continue to follow urine output, Cr

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with hypoxia in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient now has a recurrence of his lung cancer, which continues to cause hypoxemia and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status worsened overnight, likely due to worsened COPD, increased fluid, and baseline poor lung function. Measures to improve respiratory function include keeping urine output >30cc/hr, aiming for diuresis with goal I/O -500cc, giving 40mg IV lasix now, and considering 0.5mg IV morphine if needed. Increased steroids may be considered if there is no improvement.
2. Delirium: The patient has been less delirious overnight. Management includes continuing Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q8hrs during daytime, considering additional Seroquel HS if able to take POs, checking EKG/QT today given higher doses of Haldol, frequent reorientation, out-of-bed activities, and enforcing sleep/wake cycles. Light restraints may be necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and NSCLCA who underwent a right upper lobe resection. He is currently in the ICU with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, and has recurrent SCC. 

The patient experienced several medical events during his stay in the ICU. He had a sudden ventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight with hypotension, for which he was given a 150 mg bolus of amiodarone and 500 cc normal saline bolus. His heart rate improved with the administration of lopressor. 

The patient also showed signs of agitation and had his Dobhoff tube removed. He was given 10 mg of zydis at night, which did not cause any agitation. 

In terms of medications, the patient was on vancomycin, amiodarone, haloperidol (Haldol), furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and metoprolol. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate ranging from 81-160 bpm, blood pressure between 109/49-134/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.8-9.4 K/u"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and right upper lobe resection. He is currently admitted to the ICU with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient has recurrent SCC and has been experiencing several medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to a combination of volume overload, COPD, pneumonia, and an obstructing mass in the left upper lobe. The plan is to give 40 mg IV lasix to address fluid overload and improve oxygenation. Morphine will be administered to help alleviate air hunger and reduce tachypnea caused by anxiety. Flovent nebs will be started, and the goal is to maintain SaO2 between 90-95%. IV steroids (80mg methylpred q8h) will also be initiated.

2. Delirium: The patient is showing signs of delirium, which is being managed with zydis at night. Haldol 3 mg will be given QHS to help control agitation.

3. Goals of Care: The patient's family is considering readdressing overall goals of care if there is no improvement. They may transfer the patient to a facility near their home with a focus on comfort.

4. SVT: The patient experienced a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight and was given a 150 mg bolus of amiod"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia now found to have recurrent lung
   cancer with continued hypoxemia and delirium.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Respiratory status worsened overnight.
   Multifactorial with wheezes consistent with worsened COPD, increased
   fluid, with baseline poor lung function, low lung volumes.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , aim for diuresis today with goal I/O -500cc.
   - for air hunger, giving 0.5mg IV morphine PRN
   - willl keep goal -500cc today / gentle IV lasix PRN
   - if no improvement, increase steroids back up to prednisone 40mg daily
   (has been on 5mg prednisone of long steroid taper)
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - aim for O2 sat 90-95%
   - continue on IV steroids (day 2)
   - continue on IV vanco x 6 weeks total course for MRSA bacteremia/PNA
   # Delirium:  Less delirium overnight. Likely ICU delirium vs. potential
   metastatic process.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis QHS as patient with decreased delirium yesterday night
   on this regimen
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer. Per recent family meetings, goals of care changed to
   DNR/DNI and optimizing patients comfort levels.
   -
   - f/up palliative care team recs / family meeting
   - holding off on oncology consult for nw
   - social work involved / f/up notes and recs
   # Goals of care: Per meeting with family on Friday
 plan was to focus
   on nutrition and delirium over weekend. However, if no improvement, may
   need to focus more on comfort.  Also consider whether patient could
   transfer somewhere closer to family
   - talk to oncology today to weigh in on any options for
   treatment/prognosis for recurrent squamous cell ca
   - talk to family today with update/readdress goals in setting of
   worsened respiratory status
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix
   - change BB from Po to IV
   # systolic CHF:  recent EF 35% on ECHO. Patient has slightly increased
   volume today with overnight 24h I/O positive 600cc.
   -f/up CXR today
   -switch back to  IV beta blocker
   -keep patient even to negative -500L out, watching PM lytes and Cr
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - EP physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5758**] to come to evaluate/talk to family
   - continue metoprolol TID IV, uptitrate as tolerates
   - continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] via Dophoff
   - follow K, Mg  PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   - continue on PPI
   - will trend HCTs daily  keep >25 given CAD history
   - make sure updated active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CRI : Trending downwards
   - continue to follow urine output, Cr

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia and now has recurrent lung cancer
   which continued hypoxemia and delirium.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Respiratory status worsened overnight.
   Multifactorial with wheezes consistent with worsened COPD, increased
   fluid, with baseline poor lung function, low lung volumes.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , aim for diuresis today with goal I/O -500cc.
   Will give 40mg IV lasix now, if still with air hunger, give 0.5mg IV
   morphine
   - if no improvement, increase steroids back up to prednisone 40mg daily
   (has been on 5mg prednisone of long steroid taper)
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - aim for O2 sat 90-95%
   # Delirium:  Less delirium overnight.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis trial and will consider additional Seroquel HS if able
   to take POs
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer. Per recent family meetings, goals of care changed to
   DNR/DNI and optimizing patients comfort levels.
   - f/up palliative care team recs
 will be by to see team on Tuesday in
   person.
   - will discuss with family whether further oncology palliative
   therapies/workup for more staging is desired
   - social work involved / f/up notes and recs
   # Goals of care: Per meeting with family on Friday
 plan was to focus
   on nutrition and delirium over weekend. However, if no improvement, may
   need to focus more on comfort.  Also consider whether patient could
   transfer somewhere closer to family
   - talk to oncology today to weigh in on any options for
   treatment/prognosis for recurrent squamous cell ca
   - talk to family today with update/readdress goals in setting of
   worsened respiratory status
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # systolic CHF:  recent EF 35% on ECHO. Patient has slightly increased
   volume today with overnight 24h I/O positive 600cc.
   -f/up CXR today
   -continue BB
   -continue with additional diuresis w/Lasix and goal I/O -500ml today
   - checking PM lytes
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - EP physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5758**] to come to evaluate/talk to family
   - continue metoprolol TID IV, uptitrate as tolerates
   - continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - follow K, Mg  PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   - continue on PPI
   - will trend HCTs daily  keep >25 given CAD history
   - make sure updated active T/S

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, lung cancer with right upper lobe lobectomy, and coronary artery disease (s/p CABG). The patient was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient now has recurrent lung cancer, which continues to cause hypoxemia and delirium.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status worsened overnight, likely due to worsened COPD, increased fluid, and baseline poor lung function. The goal is to keep the urine output >30cc/hr and aim for diuresis today with a goal of I/O -500cc. Lasix will be given at 40mg IV now, and if there is still air hunger, 0.5mg IV morphine will be given. If there is no improvement, steroids will be increased back to prednisone 40mg daily. Nebulizers and MDIs will continue, with increased nebs overnight. The target oxygen saturation range is 90-95%.

2. Delirium: The patient has less delirium overnight. Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q8hrs during daytime will be continued. Zydis trial will be considered, and additional Seroquel HS may be given if able to take POs. E"

   [**Name (NI) 36**] status: DNR/DNI
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, previous lung cancer with right upper lobe lobectomy, and coronary artery disease (s/p CABG). The patient was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. Currently, the patient has recurrent lung cancer and continues to experience hypoxemia and delirium.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status worsened overnight, which may be multifactorial with worsened COPD, increased fluid, and baseline poor lung function. The patient's goal is to maintain oxygen saturation at 90-95%. Interventions include diuretics, nebulizers, and oxygen therapy.

2. Delirium: The patient's delirium has shown some improvement overnight. The plan is to continue Haldol for sedation, reorient the patient frequently, enforce sleep/wake cycles, and consider additional Seroquel at night if the patient can take oral medications.

3. NSCLC recurrence: The patient has been diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer. Given the recent family meetings, the goals of care have changed to DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) and optimizing the patient's comfort levels. Further oncology palliative therapies or workup for staging may be considered based on family preferences.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia now found to have recurrent lung
   cancer with continued hypoxemia and delirium.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Respiratory status worsened overnight.
   Multifactorial with wheezes consistent with worsened COPD, increased
   fluid, with baseline poor lung function, low lung volumes.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , aim for diuresis today with goal I/O -500cc.
   Will give 40mg IV lasix now, if still with air hunger, give 0.5mg IV
   morphine
   - if no improvement, increase steroids back up to prednisone 40mg daily
   (has been on 5mg prednisone of long steroid taper)
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - aim for O2 sat 90-95%
   # Delirium:  Less delirium overnight.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis QHS as patient with decreased delirium yesterday night
   on this regimen
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer. Per recent family meetings, goals of care changed to
   DNR/DNI and optimizing patients comfort levels.
   - f/up palliative care team recs
 will be by to see team on Tuesday in
   person.
   - talk with oncology regarding whether palliative therapies/workup
   would be relevant for patient
   - social work involved / f/up notes and recs
   # Goals of care: Per meeting with family on Friday
 plan was to focus
   on nutrition and delirium over weekend. However, if no improvement, may
   need to focus more on comfort.  Also consider whether patient could
   transfer somewhere closer to family
   - talk to oncology today to weigh in on any options for
   treatment/prognosis for recurrent squamous cell ca
   - talk to family today with update/readdress goals in setting of
   worsened respiratory status
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # systolic CHF:  recent EF 35% on ECHO. Patient has slightly increased
   volume today with overnight 24h I/O positive 600cc.
   -f/up CXR today
   -switch IV beta blocker back to PO metoprolol
   -keep patient even to negative -500L out, watching PM lytes and Cr
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - EP physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5758**] to come to evaluate/talk to family
   - continue metoprolol TID IV, uptitrate as tolerates
   - switch amio gtt back to amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] via Dophoff
   - follow K, Mg  PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   - continue on PPI
   - will trend HCTs daily  keep >25 given CAD history
   - make sure updated active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CRI : Trending downwards
   - continue to follow urine output, Cr

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with COPD, h/o lung cancer with RUL lobectomy, & CAD (
   s/p CABG) who was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure in
   setting of MRSA PNA and bacteremia now found to have recurrent lung
   cancer with continued hypoxemia and delirium.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Respiratory status worsened overnight.
   Multifactorial with wheezes consistent with worsened COPD, increased
   fluid, with baseline poor lung function, low lung volumes.
   - keeping UOP > 30cc/hr , aim for diuresis today with goal I/O -500cc.
   Will give 40mg IV lasix now, if still with air hunger, give 0.5mg IV
   morphine
   - if no improvement, increase steroids back up to prednisone 40mg daily
   (has been on 5mg prednisone of long steroid taper)
   - continue  on standing nebs & MDIs; increased  nebs overnight
   - aim for O2 sat 90-95%
   # Delirium:  Less delirium overnight.
   - continue Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q 8 hrs during daytime
   - continue Zydis QHS as patient with decreased delirium yesterday night
   on this regimen
   - check EKG / QT  today given higher doses of Haldol
   - reorient frequently, out of bed, enforce sleep/wake cycles
   - light restraints as needed
   .
   # NSCLC recurrence:  IP biopsy results now confirmed as squamous cell
   lung cancer. Per recent family meetings, goals of care changed to
   DNR/DNI and optimizing patients comfort levels.
   - f/up palliative care team recs
 will be by to see team on Tuesday in
   person.
   - talk with oncology regarding whether palliative therapies/workup
   would be relevant for patient
   - social work involved / f/up notes and recs
   # Goals of care: Per meeting with family on Friday
 plan was to focus
   on nutrition and delirium over weekend. However, if no improvement, may
   need to focus more on comfort.  Also consider whether patient could
   transfer somewhere closer to family
   - talk to oncology today to weigh in on any options for
   treatment/prognosis for recurrent squamous cell ca
   - talk to family today with update/readdress goals in setting of
   worsened respiratory status
   # CAD,s/p CABG: No active issues
   - continue ASA, plavix  BB
   # systolic CHF:  recent EF 35% on ECHO. Patient has slightly increased
   volume today with overnight 24h I/O positive 600cc.
   -f/up CXR today
   -switch IV beta blocker back to PO metoprolol
   -keep patient even to negative -500L out, watching PM lytes and Cr
   - consider adding ACEI when Cr trending back down
   .
   # Atach/afib: Patient had flare up of his atrial fibrillation
   overnight.  He needed additional beta blocker boluses and Amiodarone to
   control his ectopy.
   - EP physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5758**] to come to evaluate/talk to family
   - continue metoprolol TID IV, uptitrate as tolerates
   - switch amio gtt back to amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] via Dophoff
   - follow K, Mg  PM labs  and replete aggressively
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 28 range now.  Has been stable for several days and
   etiology felt to be [**2-25**] some occult  stress gastritis. Has not required
   transfusions since [**5-2**].
   - continue on PPI
   - will trend HCTs daily  keep >25 given CAD history
   - make sure updated active T/S
   - guaiac stools
   # CRI : Trending downwards
   - continue to follow urine output, Cr

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and recurrent lung cancer. He was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient has continued hypoxemia and delirium. 

The patient's respiratory status has worsened overnight, likely due to multifactorial causes including worsening COPD, increased fluid intake, and baseline poor lung function. The goal is to keep urine output above 30cc/hr and aim for diuresis with 40mg IV lasix. If there is no improvement, 0.5mg IV morphine can be given. The patient should continue with standing nebs and MDIs, and the nebs should be increased overnight. The target oxygen saturation should be between 90-95%. 

The patient's delirium has improved overnight. He should continue with Haldol 3mg qpm and 1-2 mg PRN q8hrs during the day. Zydis should be given QHS as the patient responded well to this regimen yesterday. An EKG and QT check should be done today due to the higher doses of Haldol. Reorientation, keeping the patient out of bed, and enforcing sleep/wake cycles should be continued. Light restraints may be necessary. 

The patient has been diagnosed with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer. The plan is to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and previous right upper lobe resection for non-small cell lung cancer, currently admitted with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient has been diagnosed with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma obstructing the left upper lobe. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to a combination of volume overload, COPD, MRSA pneumonia, and an obstructing mass in the left upper lobe. The patient also has delirium and is being treated with zydis and haloperidol. The family has decided to focus on comfort care and transfer the patient back to a facility closer to their home, with the wife not wanting the patient to know about his new oncologic diagnosis. The patient is also being treated for SVT with amiodarone and is receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen due to the combination of volume overload, COPD, MRSA pneumonia, and the obstructing mass in the left upper lobe. This may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and delirium could progress if not properly managed. This may result in increased confusion, agitation, and difficulty in providing effective care.
3. Infectious complications: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics for MRSA"

   1. Respiratory failure: likely combination volume overload and COPD on
   top of pneumonia and LUL obstructing mass
    - will give 40 mg IV lasix now, with aim TBB negative 1L as tolerated
    - Will give 0.5 mg morphiine to assist with air hunger as his
   tachypnea appears partly driven by anxiety and is increasing his
   deadspace/worsening oxygenation
    - start flovent nebs
    - aim SaO2 90-95%
   - Start iv steroids
 80mg methypred q8 hrs for next day
   2. Delirium: tolerated zydis overnight while NPO, will given haldol 3
   mg QHS
   3. goals of care:
    - currently aiming to optimize nutrition and mental status before
   determining possible further care.  If patient continues to demonstrate
   no improvement, family is considering readdressing overall goals of
   care, may ultiimately be best to transfer to facility near their home
   with focus of care on comfort
   4. SVT: currently on IV amiodarone while not tolerating POs, replete

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and previous right upper lobe lung resection. He is currently in the ICU due to MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, as well as recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 

The patient is experiencing multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, delirium, SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), renal insufficiency, and fluid overload. 

Respiratory failure is likely caused by a combination of volume overload, underlying COPD, pneumonia, and a left upper lobe obstructing mass. The plan is to administer 40 mg IV lasix to reduce fluid buildup and improve breathing. Morphine will be given to alleviate air hunger and reduce anxiety-related tachypnea. Nebulized Flovent will be started to help with inflammation, and the goal is to maintain SaO2 levels between 90-95%. 

Delirium is being managed with zydis overnight while the patient is NPO, and haloperidol 3 mg QHS will be given. 

The overall goals of care include optimizing nutrition and mental status before making further decisions about care. If there is no improvement, the family may consider transferring the patient to a facility near their home with a focus on comfort care. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren Pulmonary at a rate of 45"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M COPD, CHF, history NSCLCA s/ RUL resection, here with MRSA
   pneumonia and bacteremia, found to have recurrent squamous cell CA
   obstructing LUL.
   #. Respiratory failure: likely combination volume overload and COPD on
   top of MRSA pneumonia and LUL obstructing mass
   - Gentle diuresis, nebs, morphine, IV steroids (D2)
   - Goal O2 sat low 90s on 35% FM with 4L NC
   - Vanc for MRSA PNA c/b bacteremia
   #. Delirium: tolerated zydis overnight while NPO, will given haldol 3
   mg QHS, still restrained and altered.
   #. Goals of care: Family meeting today to discuss changing focus to
   comfort with ultimate transfer back to facility closer to family. Of
   note, wife does not want patient to know about his new oncologic
   diagnosis.
   #. SVT: On amiodarone, replete lytes as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and a right upper lobe resection for non-small cell lung cancer. He is currently admitted to the ICU with MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, and has been found to have recurrent squamous cell carcinoma obstructing the left upper lobe. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to a combination of volume overload, COPD, MRSA pneumonia, and an obstructing mass in the left upper lobe. He is being treated with gentle diuresis, nebs, morphine, and IV steroids. The goal is to maintain oxygen saturation in the low 90s on 35% face mask with 4 liters of nasal cannula. Vancomycin is being administered for MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia.

The patient is also experiencing delirium, and will be given haloperidol 3 mg at bedtime. The family has decided to shift the focus of care to comfort measures and transfer the patient to a facility closer to their home, with the wife not wanting the patient to be aware of his new oncologic diagnosis. The patient is on amiodarone for SVT and electrolytes are being managed as needed.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 45 mL/hour and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. He has a PICC line in place and is receiving prophylactic SQ UF he"
