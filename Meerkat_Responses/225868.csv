   IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and
   disorganization of the background rhythm. No areas of focal slowing,
   epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen during
   this
   recording.
   [**2145-5-6**] MRI: pending
   [**2145-5-5**] ECHO:
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   inferior akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral
   regurgitation is probably moderate but was not fully assessed. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation
   is present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the SVC and
   right atrium (see cell 28) that may be adherent to catheter. This
   structure is in the same vicinity as echodense structures seen in the
   prior study of [**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is
   limited.
   Agitated saline contrast study revealed late passage of bubbles into
   the left heart consistent with probable passage via pulmonary AV
   shunting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. The patient's past medical history includes metabolic acidosis, bradycardia, breast mass, stroke, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a pre-existing condition of ESRD, which may worsen due to the current acute respiratory failure and other underlying health issues.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a history of metabolic acidosis, and their condition may deteriorate if not properly managed.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia, and this may be exacerbated by medications or underlying medical conditions.
5. Breast Mass: The patient has a history of a breast mass, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Stroke: The patient's symptoms of right-sided weakness and blurred vision could be indicative of a stroke, and further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, which can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint is right-sided weakness and altered mental status. The patient underwent an MRI of the brain, invasive ventilation, and was extubated at 6 pm. An EEG was performed and showed negative seizure activity. The patient was placed on CVVH overnight and used BiPAP due to drowsiness and hypercarbia. Allergies and last doses of antibiotics were documented. The patient received infusions of Heparin Sodium, Norepinephrine, KCl (CRRT), and Calcium Gluconate (CRRT). Other ICU medications and medications were also administered. The patient's medical and family history remained unchanged. Review of systems did not reveal any new findings.

Flow sheet data as of 07:20 AM on 05/07/2145 showed vital signs with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/61 mmHg to 125/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm was a first-degree AV block. Fluid balance showed a total input of 3,275 mL and output of 5,122 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,847 mL. Respiratory support included the use of a nasal cannula, standby ventilator mode, tidal volume of 387 mL, positive end-exp"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. The patient's condition has been complex and dynamic, with multiple medical complications.

1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and is on hemodialysis. There is no new information regarding renal function in the progress note.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She requires intermittent BiPAP support for drowsiness and hypercarbia.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a history of metabolic acidosis, which may be related to renal failure.

4. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia, which could be related to medications or underlying conditions such as sick sinus syndrome.

5. Breast Mass: The patient has a history of breast mass, but this is not relevant to the current clinical situation.

6. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient has a history of CVA/stroke, but no new information is provided in the progress note.

7. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, which is a common complication of renal failure.

   [**2145-5-5**] ECHO:
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   inferior akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral
   regurgitation is probably moderate but was not fully assessed. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation
   is present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the [**Month/Day/Year 949**] and
   right atrium (see cell 28) that may be adherent to catheter. This
   structure is in the same vicinity as echodense structures seen in the
   prior study of [**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is
   limited.
   Agitated saline contrast study revealed late passage of bubbles into
   the left heart consistent with probable passage via pulmonary AV

The patient's medical history includes acidosis, bradycardia, breast mass, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), hyperkalemia, and hypotension.

The patient has been diagnosed with renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and several other medical conditions. The assessment and plan include further evaluation with EEG and MRI brain to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms, treatment of infectious and metabolic abnormalities, initiation of IV heparin for atrial fibrillation, SVC/RA thrombus, and DVTs, fluid removal through dialysis, and adjustment of medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening renal function, pulmonary edema, infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and further neurological deficits. The patient's facial swelling suggests potential SVC narrowing and volume overload, which can lead to respiratory distress. The presence of an echodense structure near the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and right atrium raises concern for a possible thrombus, which could lead to pulmonary embolism if dislodged.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and respiratory status. Frequent assessments of neurologic function and prompt"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. She is lethargic and has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which metoprolol has been withheld due to hypotension. The patient also has facial swelling, which has improved, and a left lower infiltrate. Her blood pressure is stable, and she is currently receiving midodrine and continuing with the antibiotic regimen of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. CVVH has been discontinued, and hemodialysis will be restarted tomorrow. The patient's renal transplant medication will be changed from solute to prednisone, and she will be followed up with renal recommendations for tapering. The patient requires intermittent BiPAP for drowsiness and hypercarbia, likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An echodense structure seen on echo at the superior vena cava (SVC) is stable from the last echo. The patient is already anticoagulated with intravenous heparin and will start taking coumadin after 48 hours of INR monitoring. She is also on a diabetes management diet and supplemental insulin. The patient has arterial, dialysis catheter, and PICC lines in place for ICU care. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis presenting with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. An MRI showed no abnormalities, and EEG did not show seizure activity. The patient's facial swelling is likely due to known narrowing in the setting of volume overload. Hypotension is stable at baseline, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels remain negative except in the urine with yeast. The patient's respiratory failure is managed with intermittent BiPAP for drowsiness and hypercarbia, considering her history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Facial swelling is likely related to known stenosis, and there is no thrombus seen in the area. The echodense structure observed on echo at [Name (NI) 949] is stable from the last echo. The patient is already anticoagulated with IV heparin. Diabetes management involves sliding scale insulin. The patient has an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and PICC line in place. Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."
