   # Sepsis: Pt currently shows a leukocytosis of 21.0 up from 9.4
   yesterday, overnight required vasopressor support after running a SBP
   in the 60s-70 with no response to IVF. Pt
s decline last night was
   rapid, pt around 1900 showed signs of somonelence and apnea, she was
   then noted to be hypotensive requiring at first peripheral Dopamine.
   Yesterday evening pt also showed no [**Location (un) **] on rectal temperature and
   was started on a Bair hugger. Concern last night stemmed from her
   progression of AMS to sepsis, given this data there is a large concern
   for bacterial meningitis. Pt was given Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin
   empirically last night, an LP was deferred given the pt was
   hemodynamically unstable. AM labs today showed elevated coags, concern
   remains for DIC. Will order DIC labs.
   - Continue Vancoymcin and Ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis
   - Will also add Ampicillin for Listeria coverage
   - [**Location (un) 5456**] notified last night of events, will f/u recs this AM
   - Will send for DIC labs, Fibrinogen, FDP, D Dimer labs sent
   - Will LP today of DIC labs are negative,as pt is now more stable will
   also attempt an MRI to eval whether pt had a stroke that caused the
   initial seziure event.
   # AMS: Pt stil not responsive yesterday, given the witnessed episode of
   tonic clonic seizure, it was hypothesized that Ms. [**Known lastname 5460**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5461**] a
   seizure on the floor and was post-ictal upon assessment. [**Last Name (Titles) 5456**] were
   consulted and recommended loading with Keppra continuing 500mg Keppra
   IV BID. CT head performed yesterday showed no acute ICP, pt was unable
   to undergo MRI unfortunately as she became hemodynamically unstable.
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (Titles) **] recommendations
   - f/u CT head
   - MRI head today following LP
   - Infectious w/u including u/a, ucx, and blcxs
   - Per [**Last Name (Titles) **], no need for EEG given clear, witnessed tonic clonic
   seizures

   # NSTEMI:  No ECG changes, no complaint of chest pain.  Suspect likely
   demand ischemia in setting of acute illness.  CK MB index was initially
   noted to be elevated however now appear to be trending down.

   has OGT in place, will initiate tube feeds per nutrition recs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia admitted to the hospital with weakness and dysarthria. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension (not in shock), hypothermia, altered mental status (not delirium), and seizure without status epilepticus.

The patient's recent events include somnolence and apnea, requiring intubation. The patient also experienced a decrease in systolic blood pressure to the 60s, which was unresponsive to fluid administration, necessitating the initiation of peripheral dopamine. Additionally, the patient was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for CNS prophylaxis due to rapid changes in mental status. However, lumbar puncture was unable to be obtained as the patient was hemodynamically unstable.

Central venous access was attempted but failed due to coiling of the line, resulting in the removal of the right central line and subsequent placement of the left central line.

A discussion regarding code status was held with the family, confirming a full code.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 79/57 mmHg to 66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia. She was admitted to the hospital with weakness and dysarthria and later transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status. 

The patient experienced a seizure episode, which was likely secondary to a post-ictal state. The etiology of the seizure could be due to a brain mass or infarct, as infectious etiologies are less likely given the clinical picture. The plan includes loading the patient with keppra (levetiracetam), following up with a CT scan of the head, and an MRI to evaluate the cause of the new seizure. Additionally, an infectious workup including urinalysis, urine culture, and blood cultures will be performed. An EEG is not necessary as the seizures were witnessed and tonic-clonic in nature. A tox screen will also be followed up.

The patient also had an episode of NSTEMI, although there were no ECG changes or chest pain reported. It is suspected that the ischemia could be due to demand in the setting of acute illness. The plan includes continuing cycle ergometry, performing an ECG in the morning, and starting heparin if the CT head is negative for bleed. High-dose aspirin, statin, low-dose beta-blocker if blood pressure is present, stress test when stable, and secondary prevention with blood pressure and glycemic control are recommended.

   Plan:
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt currently shows a leukocytosis of 21.0 up from 9.4
   yesterday, overnight required vasopressor support after running a SBP
   in the 60s-70 with no response to IVF. Pt
s decline last night was
   rapid, pt around 1900 showed signs of somonelence and apnea, she was
   then noted to be hypotensive requiring at first peripheral Dopamine.
   Yesterday evening pt also showed no [**Location (un) **] on rectal temperature and
   was started on a Bair hugger. Concern last night stemmed from her
   progression of AMS to sepsis, given this data there is a large concern
   for bacterial meningitis. Pt was given Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin
   empirically last night, an LP was deferred given the pt was
   hemodynamically unstable. AM labs today showed elevated coags, concern
   remains for DIC. Will order DIC labs.
   - Continue Vancoymcin and Ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis
   - [**Location (un) 5456**] notified last night of events, will f/u recs this AM
   - Will send for DIC labs, Fibrinogen, FDP, D Dimer labs sent
   # AMS: Pt stil not responsive yesterday, given the witnessed episode of
   tonic clonic seizure, it was hypothesized that Ms. [**Known lastname 5460**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5461**] a
   seizure on the floor and was post-ictal upon assessment. [**Last Name (Titles) 5456**] were
   consulted and recommended loading with Keppra continuing 500mg Keppra
   IV BID. CT head performed yesterday showed no acute ICP, pt was unable
   to undergo MRI unfortunately as she became hemodynamically unstable.
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (Titles) **] recommendations
   - f/u CT head
   - MRI head once pt is hemodynamically stable
   - Infectious w/u including u/a, ucx, and blcxs
   - Per [**Last Name (Titles) **], no need for EEG given clear, witnessed tonic clonic
   seizures
   - f/u tox screen

   # NSTEMI:  No ECG changes, no complaint of chest pain.  Suspect likely
   demand ischemia in setting of acute illness.  CK MB index was initially
   noted to be elevated however now appear to be trending down.
   # FEN: replete lytes prn, NPO given altered mental status, pt currently
   has OGT in place, will initiate tube feeds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia admitted to the hospital with weakness and dysarthria. She was transferred to the ICU with altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL and a respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute. The plateau pressure is 15 cmH2O, and the PEEP is 5 cmH2O.
- Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently in the 60s.
- Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F).
- Altered mental status: The patient is somnolent and not fully responsive.
- Seizure: The patient had a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure last night.

The assessment and plan include:
- Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and required vasopressor support. There is a concern for bacterial meningitis, so she is being treated empirically with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Lumbar puncture was deferred due to hemodynamic instability.
- Altered mental status: The patient's decline last night was rapid, and she showed signs of somnolence and apnea. She is being evaluated for seizures and given Kendra loading and maintenance dosing.

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia who was admitted with weakness and dysarthria. She was transferred to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, hypothermia, altered mental status, and a recent seizure. 

Based on the assessment and plan, the following potential medical complications can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which indicates severe respiratory distress. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed promptly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to shock and organ dysfunction.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is below normal, indicating hypothermia. If not treated, it can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or organ dysfunction.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is impaired, which may be due to various causes including the underlying condition or side effects of medications. Monitoring for any changes in mental status is crucial to ensure the patient's well-being.
5. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, and further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology. If left untreated or if the underlying cause is not addressed, there is a risk of recurrent seizures.

   # Sepsis: Pt currently shows a leukocytosis of 21.0 up from 9.4
   yesterday, overnight required vasopressor support after running a SBP
   in the 60s-70 with no response to IVF. Pt
s decline last night was
   rapid, pt around 1900 showed signs of somonelence and apnea, she was
   then noted to be hypotensive requiring at first peripheral Dopamine.
   Yesterday evening pt also showed no [**Location (un) **] on rectal temperature and
   was started on a Bair hugger. Concern last night stemmed from her
   progression of AMS to sepsis, given this data there is a large concern
   for bacterial meningitis. Pt was given Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin
   empirically last night, an LP was deferred given the pt was
   hemodynamically unstable. AM labs today showed elevated coags, concern
   remains for DIC. Will order DIC labs.
   - Continue Vancoymcin and Ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis
   - Will also add Ampicillin for Listeria coverage
   - Neurology notified last night of events, will f/u recs this AM
   - Will send for DIC labs, Fibrinogen, FDP, D Dimer labs sent
   - Will LP today of DIC labs are negative,as pt is now more stable will
   also attempt an MRI to eval whether pt had a stroke that caused the
   initial seziure event.
   # AMS: Pt stil not responsive yesterday, given the witnessed episode of
   tonic clonic seizure, it was hypothesized that Ms. [**Known lastname 5460**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5461**] a
   seizure on the floor and was post-ictal upon assessment. Neurology were
   consulted and recommended loading with Keppra continuing 500mg Keppra
   IV BID. CT head performed yesterday showed no acute ICP, pt was unable
   to undergo MRI unfortunately as she became hemodynamically unstable.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations
   - f/u CT head
   - MRI head today following LP
   - Infectious w/u including u/a, ucx, and blcxs
   - Per neurology, no need for EEG given clear, witnessed tonic clonic
   seizures
   # NSTEMI:  No ECG changes, no complaint of chest pain.  Suspect likely
   demand ischemia in setting of acute illness.  CK MB index was initially
   noted to be elevated however now appear to be trending down.
   # FEN: replete lytes prn, NPO given altered mental status, pt currently
   has OGT in place, will initiate tube feeds per nutrition recs.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia. She was admitted with weakness and dysarthria, then transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status. 

The patient's condition has rapidly declined, with signs of somnolence and apnea. She required vasopressor support and showed hypotension, indicating possible sepsis. Laboratory results show leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), coagulopathy (elevated coagulation markers), and concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

Given these findings, the medical team suspects bacterial meningitis as the underlying cause. They have started the patient on empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and vancomycin and will also add ampicillin for Listeria coverage. An immediate lumbar puncture was deferred due to hemodynamic instability, but plans are in place to attempt an LP once DIC labs are negative.

The patient's altered mental status may also be attributed to a seizure event, for which neurology recommended loading with Keppra and continuing 500mg IV BID. A CT head showed no acute increased intracranial pressure, but unfortunately, an MRI could not be performed due to the patient's instability.

There are also concerns for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), although the patient has no ECG changes or chest pain."

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia, admitted with weakness and dysarthria. She was transferred to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient required vasopressor support due to hypotension and showed signs of somnolence and apnea. She also had no response to IV fluids. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis, elevated coagulation parameters, and concerns for bacterial meningitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was started on empirical antibiotics for bacterial meningitis and will undergo lumbar puncture (LP) if DIC labs are negative. An MRI will be performed to evaluate for a stroke that could have caused the initial seizure event. Neurology recommendations were appreciated, and further evaluation will include an EEG. The patient's electrolytes are replete, she is NPO due to altered mental status, and tube feeds will be initiated per nutrition recommendations. Heparin and Lansoprazole were administered prophylactically. The patient's code status and disposition are pending. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Bacterial meningitis: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest a possible bacterial infection in the central nervous system. If left untreated, this can lead to severe neurological complications and potentially fatal outcomes.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The elevated coagulation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89F w/ HTN, vascular dementia admitted with weakness and
   dysarthria, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with altered mental status.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  intubated because of AMS and concerns
   regarding ability to protect airway.  Will attempt PS today.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt had a leukocytosis on [**2-27**] and required pressors after
   SBPs in the 60s-70 with no response to IVF. Pt
s decline was rapid, pt
   around 1900 showed signs of somonelence and apnea, she was then noted
   to be hypotensive requiring at first peripheral Dopamine. Concern
   stemmed from progression of AMS to sepsis, but culture data negative
   thus far and no clear source.  Very dopamine sensitive.
   - attempt to weane dopamine and check CVO2 to distinguish sepsis (low
   O2 from cardiogenic shock high O2)
   # AMS: Pt stil not responsive yesterday, given the witnessed episode of
   tonic clonic seizure, it was hypothesized that Ms. [**Known lastname 5460**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5461**] a
   seizure on the floor and was post-ictal upon assessment. Neurology were
   consulted and recommended loading with Keppra continuing 500mg Keppra
   IV BID. CT head performed yesterday showed no acute ICP as did MRI
   head.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations
   - Infectious w/u including u/a, ucx, and blcxs
   - Continue Vancoymcin, Ceftriaxone, and ampicillin for bacterial
   meningitis
   - Per neurology, no need for EEG given clear, witnessed tonic clonic
   seizures
   # Cardiac enzyme elevation:  No ECG changes, no complaint of chest
   pain.  Suspect likely demand ischemia in setting of acute illness.  CK
   MB index was initially noted to be elevated however now appear to be
   trending down.
   # FEN: replete lytes prn, NPO given altered mental status, pt currently
   has OGT in place, will initiate tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   ## PPx: heparin SC, Lansoprazole
   ## Code: full per discussion with family

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia. She was admitted with weakness and dysarthria and later transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status.

The patient has been intubated because of respiratory distress and concerns regarding her ability to protect her airway. She also experienced hypotension, which required the use of pressors, specifically dopamine. The patient's decline was rapid, and she showed signs of somnolence and apnea, leading to the initiation of peripheral dopamine. There were concerns about the progression of altered mental status to sepsis, but culture data has been negative thus far, and no clear source has been identified.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin for suspected bacterial meningitis. She is also being treated with Keppra for seizure activity, and no further EEG is required given the clear, witnessed tonic-clonic seizures.

There are concerns about cardiac enzyme elevation, but no ECG changes or chest pain have been reported. The elevation is suspected to be due to demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis and elevated troponin levels.

The patient's nutritional status is being managed with tube feeds, and she is currently receiving Fibersource HN at a rate of 55 mL/hour. Her glycemic control is being closely monitored"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female with history of HTN and Demenia now admit with weakness
   and altered mental status now with defined sepsis and started with ABX
   coverage for possible meningitis.  She had intubation required with
   need for airway protection and has had persistent impairment of mental
   status, although, patient with favorable level of ventilatory support
   and excellent oxygenation all consistent with extrapulmonary source of

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and dementia. She was admitted with weakness and altered mental status, and is now diagnosed with defined sepsis and started on antibiotic coverage for possible meningitis. The patient required intubation due to the need for airway protection and has persistent impairment of mental status. She has favorable levels of ventilatory support and excellent oxygenation, consistent with an extrapulmonary source of failure. There is also persistent left lower lobe opacity suggesting an area of collapse/consolidation.

The patient has respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and continues to require airway support. Her mental status alteration is the primary impairment preventing movement from ventilatory support to partial support ventilation (PSV) support. The patient's hypotension is not due to shock, as her central venous pressure (CVP) is at an adequate level. However, the patient has been refractory to attempts to wean pressors to date, and it is necessary to evaluate the source of the hypotension. Dopamine will be weaned today, and a cardiac echo will be performed to re-quantify cardiac output.

The patient also has an altered mental status (not delirium) in the setting of presentation with fever and altered mental status. The patient is being treated with antibiotics and antivirals, and a lumbar puncture will be performed today by interventional radiology. Follow-up of an MRI is also"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   This is a 89F w/ HTN, vascular dementia admitted with weakness and
   dysarthria, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with altered mental status.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  intubated because of AMS and concerns
   regarding ability to protect airway.  PS trial [**5-31**] overnight successful
   -Plan for extubation if pt remains stable on PS after IR guided LP.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt had a leukocytosis on [**2-27**] and required pressors after
   SBPs in the 60s-70 with no response to IVF. Pt
s decline was rapid, pt
   around 1900 showed signs of somonelence and apnea, she was then noted
   to be hypotensive requiring at first peripheral Dopamine. Concern
   stemmed from progression of AMS to sepsis, but culture data negative
   thus far and no clear source.  Very dopamine sensitive.
   - attempt to wean dopamine as tolerated today
   # AMS: On [**2-27**], given the witnessed episode of tonic clonic seizure, it
   was hypothesized that Ms. [**Known lastname 5460**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5461**] a seizure on the floor and
   was post-ictal upon assessment. CT head performed yesterday showed no
   acute ICP as did MRI head.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations- currently rec continuing abx
   and IR guided LP today
   - f/u cultures, CSF
   - Continue Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and ampicillin for bacterial
   meningitis as well as acyclovir
   - Per neurology, no need for EEG given clear, witnessed tonic clonic
   seizures
    # Cardiac enzyme elevation:  No ECG changes, no complaint of chest
   pain.  Suspect likely demand ischemia in setting of acute illness.  CK
   MB index was initially noted to be elevated however all CE now trending
   down.
   # FEN: replete lytes prn, NPO for now given plan to extubate

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia, admitted for weakness and dysarthria. She was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and concerns about her ability to protect her airway. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hypotension, hypothermia, altered mental status, and seizure. 

Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient was intubated due to her altered mental status and concerns regarding her ability to protect her airway. A trial of pressure support (PS) was successful overnight, and the plan is to extubate the patient if she remains stable on PS after an informed risk (IR) guided lumbar puncture (LP).
2. Hypotension: The patient required pressors after experiencing stable blood pressures in the 60s-70s with no response to intravenous fluids (IVF). She also showed signs of somnolence and apnea, which required the use of dopamine. The concern is the progression of altered mental status to sepsis, but culture data has been negative thus far, and no clear source has been identified. An attempt will be made to wean dopamine as tolerated today.

   .
   Plan:
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  intubated because of AMS and concerns
   regarding ability to protect airway.  Will attempt PS today.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt had a leukocytosis on [**2-27**] and required pressors after
   SBPs in the 60s-70 with no response to IVF. Pt
s decline was rapid, pt
   around 1900 showed signs of somonelence and apnea, she was then noted
   to be hypotensive requiring at first peripheral Dopamine. Concern
   stemmed from progression of AMS to sepsis, but culture data negative
   thus far and no clear source.  Very dopamine sensitive.
   - attempt to weane dopamine and check CVO2 to distinguish sepsis (low
   O2 from cardiogenic shock high O2)
   # AMS: Pt stil not responsive yesterday, given the witnessed episode of
   tonic clonic seizure, it was hypothesized that Ms. [**Known lastname 5460**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5461**] a
   seizure on the floor and was post-ictal upon assessment. Neurology were
   consulted and recommended loading with Keppra continuing 500mg Keppra
   IV BID. CT head performed yesterday showed no acute ICP as did MRI
   head.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations
   - Infectious w/u including u/a, ucx, and blcxs
   - Continue Vancoymcin, Ceftriaxone, and ampicillin for bacterial
   meningitis
   - Per neurology, no need for EEG given clear, witnessed tonic clonic
   seizures
    # Cardiac enzyme elevation:  No ECG changes, no complaint of chest
   pain.  Suspect likely demand ischemia in setting of acute illness.  CK
   MB index was initially noted to be elevated however now appear to be
   trending down.
   # FEN: replete lytes prn, NPO given altered mental status, pt currently

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia who was admitted with weakness and dysarthria. She was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and concerns about her ability to protect her airway. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV mode, with a set Vt of 400 mL and PS of 5 cmH2O. She has been on dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and her blood pressure is currently stable. The patient's seizures have been controlled with Keppra, and she is being monitored for any further episodes. Her cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, but there are no ECG changes or complaints of chest pain. She has a history of altered mental status, hypotension, hypothermia, respiratory failure, and seizure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function should be closely monitored, especially since she is on CPAP/PSV mode. Any deterioration in oxygen saturation or increased work of breathing should be addressed promptly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken if hypotension recurs. Adjustments in dopamine infusion may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status should continue to be assessed regularly. Any new changes or deterioration should be evaluated promptly.
4. Seizure: Although the patient"

","The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted with altered mental status and subsequent respiratory failure. She has shown some improvement in mental status while receiving empiric treatment for meningitis. The patient's MRI findings do not reveal any clear discrete deficit to explain the altered mental status at this time. The patient's white blood cell count has declined, and she has been moved to minimal ventilator settings at 5/5 today.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If not managed properly, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, lung infection, or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as meningitis or other underlying conditions. If not treated appropriately, the condition may progress to severe confusion, delirium, or even coma.

3. Hypotension: The patient has persistent pressor requirements, indicating ongoing hypotension. If not managed effectively, there is a risk of shock or organ dysfunction due to inadequate blood flow to vital organs.

4. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is slightly elevated but still within normal range. However, if not monitored and managed properly, the patient may develop hypothermia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

5. Seizure: Although the patient has experienced a seizure, it was without status epileptic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hypertension and vascular dementia. She was admitted with weakness and dysarthria, and later transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory distress and was intubated due to altered mental status and concerns about airway protection. She was successfully extubated but remains on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced persistent hypotension that required pressors, specifically dopamine. Her blood pressure remained in the 60s-70s, indicating poor perfusion.
3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's mental status has fluctuated throughout her stay. She experienced a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure, but imaging studies (CT head and MRI) showed no evidence of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
4. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature was recorded at 35.9°C (96.6°F), indicating hypothermia.
5. Seizure: The patient had a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure, which was likely post-ictal upon assessment. However, an EEG was not performed due to clear, witnessed seizures.
6. Cardiac Enzyme Elevation: The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes, suggesting myocardial ischemia. However, all cardiac enzymes are"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female who was admitted with altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has shown some improvement in mental status while receiving continued empiric treatment for meningitis. The patient was extubated yesterday and is now being weaned off oxygen. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially on mechanical ventilation and is now extubated but still has mild/moderate secretions and a weak cough. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory function does not improve.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have altered mental status despite improvement. The ongoing treatment with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Acyclovir, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin) and minimizing sedating medications are aimed at addressing this issue. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status closely for any deterioration.

3. Hypotension: The patient has shown reasonable blood pressure stability after being extubated and receiving adequate volume. However, close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent hypotension and ensure adequate perfusion.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and ongoing management of these potential complications."
