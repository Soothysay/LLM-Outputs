   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  He
   presents with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea as well as two
   syncopal episodes during this admission.  He was found to have an
   aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3 today on cardiac
   catheterization.  CT Surgery is involved, and the patient is being
   worked up for AVR, likely early next week
    - F/U read on pre-op Carotid U/S
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had persistently elevated LFTs on
   this admission.  Hepatitis serologies were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -1 to 2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # ANTICOAG.- Vit K now for INR 1.6

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis post-porcine valve replacement, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events, and critical aortic stenosis was found with a valve area of 0.3. Cardiac catheterization showed a cardiac index of 1.3.

The patient is being worked up for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely early next week. Preoperative evaluations are ongoing, including clearance from hepatology and ID consultation.

The patient has persistently elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with negative hepatitis serologies, SM Ab, tox screen, and pending results for EBV, CMV, and HSV. Hepatology is involved in the patient's care, and differential diagnoses include shock liver, poor forward flow versus hepatic congestion, congestive heart failure, medication effect in the setting of HAART, and EtOH abuse.

The patient has a history of CAD, with previous percutaneous intervention to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). A cardiac catheterization yesterday showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis.

The patient's diastolic heart failure is chronic and compensated, but elevated filling pressures indicate a need for diuresis before surgery. Lasix gtt is being continued with a goal of -1 to 2 liters today, and monitoring for creatinine (Cr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He underwent cardiac catheterization and is being worked up for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. The patient also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), possibly due to shock liver, medication effect, or alcohol abuse. Hepatology is involved in the patient's care, and he is being held on HAART medications until after surgery. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a cardiac catheterization yesterday, which showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis. He is currently on a cardiac diet and has macrocytic anemia likely secondary to EtOH use. The patient's sodium levels are low, possibly due to poor forward renal flow or liver dysfunction. He is being managed with gentle diuresis and folate and thiamine supplementation. His INR is elevated, and he is receiving vitamin K. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the critical care unit (CCU). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of critical aortic stenosis, which can lead to cardiogenic shock. The low cardiac index (CI) and high systemic vascular"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, aortic stenosis post-porcine valve replacement, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. The patient is currently in the ICU awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's fluid balance is a concern, with a negative balance of -3,074 mL over 24 hours. This could potentially lead to AKI due to inadequate renal perfusion.

2. Hepatic congestion: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may indicate hepatic congestion. This can be a result of right-sided heart failure caused by severe aortic stenosis.

3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 131. This may be due to poor forward renal flow and an appropriate ADH response or liver dysfunction.

4. Macrocytic anemia: The patient has a macrocytic anemia likely secondary to EtOH use. Monitoring and continuation of folate and thiamine supplementation is recommended.

5. Coagulation abnormalities: The patient's INR is elevated at 1.6, indicating a coag"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  He
   presents with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea as well as two
   syncopal episodes during this admission.  He was found to have an
   aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3 today on cardiac
   catheterization.  CT Surgery is involved, and the patient is being
   worked up for AVR, likely early next week
    - F/U read on pre-op Carotid U/S
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had persistently elevated LFTs on
   this admission.  Hepatitis serologies were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -1 to 2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.

   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal today
   -2L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   DDx includes shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v.
   hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive heart failure v. medication effect in
   the setting of HAART v. EtOH abuse.  Hepatology has cleared pt for

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, aortic stenosis post-porcine valve replacement, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. The patient is currently in the ICU awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. He has been diuresed to optimize fluid status prior to surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic valve area is severely reduced at 0.3, indicating critical aortic stenosis. This condition can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea, syncope, and potentially life-threatening complications like heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest if not promptly treated with AVR surgery.
2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may indicate liver dysfunction. Possible causes include medication effects, alcohol abuse, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring LFTs and INR daily, holding HAART medications, and considering further investigations like EBV and HSV serologies are recommended.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low at 131, likely due to poor forward renal flow and appropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) response or liver dysfunction. Daily monitoring of sodium levels and gentle diuresis are advised.

   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal today
   -2L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   DDx includes shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v.
   hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive heart failure v. medication effect in
   the setting of HAART v. EtOH abuse.  Hepatology has cleared pt for
   surgery and signed off.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps

   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until

    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which is increased from
   127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and
   appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -2L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis status post porcine valve replacement, and coronary artery disease. He presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe progressive dyspnea and syncopal episodes due to critical aortic stenosis. He is waiting for an aortic valve replacement surgery. The main complication to watch out for is further deterioration of cardiac function leading to heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest.

2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which may be due to various causes such as medication effects, viral infections, or alcohol abuse. It is important to monitor the trend of liver enzymes and INR daily, hold HAART medications, and consider other potential causes.

3. CAD (Coronary Artery Disease): The patient has a history of CAD and previous stenting of the left anterior descending artery. The main complication to watch out for is recurrent angina or myocardial infarction.

   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 44-year-old man with HIV, a history of aortic stenosis (porcine valve replacement in [**2155**]) and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events. He was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3.
- The patient is waiting for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely early next week. Currently, he is being diuresed to optimize fluid status prior to surgery.
- Pre-operative carotid ultrasound showed no carotid stenosis.
- The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which appear to be improving. Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, and other tests are pending. Most likely, hepatic congestion is causing the transaminitis.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previously treated with a drug-eluting stent in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis.
- The patient's filling pressures are elevated, but diastolic heart failure is chronic and compensated. There is no pulmonary edema on chest X-ray or exam. The patient is grossly volume overloaded, and the goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before surgery.
- The patient continues to be in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and will"

   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of
   ~-2L met yesterday so Lasix gtt discontinued.
   - Consider adding Dopamine if becomes hypotensive
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diurese as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - Cr did bump yesterday to 1.4 but trended back down.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated

   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**].  His hyponatremia was likely secondary to poor
   forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis today w/ PO/IV Lasix as tolerated. Pt is
   now -1.5L length of stay.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was

","The patient is a 44-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, aortic stenosis post-porcine valve replacement in [**2155**], and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. The patient is currently waiting for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely early next week. He is being diuresed to optimize fluid status prior to surgery.

The patient also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which are improving. Hepatitis serologies and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were negative, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies were negative. Tox screen was negative, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) may have been ordered. Most likely, hepatic congestion is the cause of the transaminitis.

The patient has a history of CAD, with a previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.

The patient's CD4 count on [**2163-4-6**] was 532, and the ID team recommended holding HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery due to liver function abnormalities.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of
   even to -500ccs today.  Off lasix for now.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump yesterday to 1.4 but trended back down.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**].  His hyponatremia was likely secondary to poor
   forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   -          Continue Folate and thiamine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a medical history of HIV, aortic stenosis post porcine valve replacement in [**2155**], and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3.

The patient is currently in the ICU awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely early next week. He is being diuresed to optimize fluid status prior to surgery. His recent laboratory results show improving liver function tests (LFTs), although they are still elevated. Hepatitis serologies and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were negative, and tox screen was also negative. The most likely cause of transaminitis is hepatic congestion.

The patient has a history of CAD, with previous placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). His cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis. He is currently on aspirin (ASA) 325 mg daily and lisinopril has been held due to critical aortic stenosis.

The patient's CD4 count on [**2163-4-6**] was 532, and he is advised to hold his highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) until after cardiac surgery. His"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis post-porcine valve replacement, and coronary artery disease. He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. The patient's current condition is stable, with controlled blood pressure and improved renal function. His liver function tests are improving, but he still has elevated lactate levels and macrocytic anemia. He is awaiting an aortic valve replacement surgery, likely early next week. The patient is being diuresed to optimize fluid status before surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. This condition can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea, syncope, and heart failure. The patient is waiting for an aortic valve replacement surgery to address this issue.
2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which may indicate hepatic congestion or drug-induced liver injury. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response or liver dysfunction. Close monitoring of sodium levels is necessary.
4. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this week.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine stable at 1.3.
   - CT surgery following,  fu date of AVR
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Continues to trend downwards.  Hepatitis serologies
   and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was
   negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic
   congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Change ASA to 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety:
   - Will start 0.5mg PO Ativan
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, aortic stenosis after porcine valve replacement, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events and was diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and critical aortic stenosis. He is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes due to critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He is waiting for AVR surgery.
2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), but they appear to be improving. Hepatitis serologies and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were negative, and other tests are pending.
3. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and underwent a drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). His cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis.
4. PUMP Dysfunction: The patient has elevated filling pressures, but diastolic heart failure is chronic and compensated. There is no pulmonary edema on chest X-ray or examination.
5. RHYTHM: The patient continues to be in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Telemetry monitoring is ongoing.
6. HIV: The patient's CD4"

   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely Wednesday.  Hypotensive to 84/56 yesterday so
   diuretics held.  Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine
   stable at 1.3.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.

The patient is awaiting aortic valve replacement surgery, likely on Wednesday.

The patient has a history of bicuspid aortic valve, severe aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He is currently hypotensive and has had episodes of hypotension in the past, leading to the decision to hold diuretics for now. The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a net intake of 185 mL over the past day, and his creatinine level is stable at 1.3.

The patient also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which appear to be improving. Hepatitis serologies and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were negative, as well as SM Ab and tox screen. EBV and HSV may have been ordered. Most likely, hepatic congestion is the cause of the transaminitis.

","The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis status post porcine valve replacement in [**2155**], and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He is currently being optimized for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely early next week. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including critical aortic stenosis, transaminitis (elevated liver function tests), CAD, macrocytic anemia, hyponatremia, and coagulation abnormalities. 

His critical aortic stenosis requires urgent surgical intervention to replace the aortic valve. The patient's transaminitis may be related to hepatic congestion or other causes, and it is being monitored with daily trends of liver enzymes and INR. The patient's CAD is being managed with aspirin and holding statins and ACE inhibitors due to elevated liver function tests and critical aortic stenosis. Macrocytic anemia is likely secondary to EtOH use, and the patient has been started on folate and thiamine supplementation. Hyponatremia is being closely monitored, and the patient is being diuresed to optimize fluid status prior to surgery. Coagulation abnormalities are being addressed with vitamin K supplementation.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely Wednesday.  Hypotensive this morning with Lasix
   held.  Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine stable at
   1.3.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Change ASA to 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery. Lasix drip held yesterday
   given hyoptension
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/
   goal as much as tolerated

   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, not at goal of -500cc, with a mild creatinine increase at 1.4
   from 1.3.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension and now increasing Cr, attempt
   goal of even to -500ccs today, as patient is still fluid overloaded,
   but based on BUN/Cr appearing pre-renal, do not over-diurese. Continue
   fluid restriction of 1500 cc.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  ALT trending down, AST slightly increased,
   essentially unchanged.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**]
   and SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV
   may have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus
   significant alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is ___, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr
   elevation, do not over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of ____, increased/decreased from yesterday of
   1.3.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension and now increasing Cr, attempt
   goal of even to -500ccs today;  patient is still fluid overloaded, but
   based on BUN/Cr appearing pre-renal, do not over-diurese. Continue
   fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  ALT/AST trending ________ and INR ______.
   Improving/Stable Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM
   Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have
   been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant alcohol
   ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.

   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is ___, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He has been optimized for maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4, and is awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely this Wednesday.

Potential medical complications:
1. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient has severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes due to critical aortic stenosis. This condition can lead to cardiogenic shock and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1, indicating reduced heart function. This can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may lead to organ dysfunction or failure if not managed properly.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and an increased INR, suggesting hepatic congestion or liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and monitor liver function.
4. Macrocytic anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to alcohol use. It is important to continue folate and th"

Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of critical aortic stenosis and is awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility due to the severe narrowing of the aortic valve, which can lead to inadequate blood flow to the body's organs.

2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), suggesting possible liver dysfunction. This may be related to hepatic congestion, significant alcohol ingestion prior to admission, or other factors. Monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and INR daily is recommended.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response versus liver dysfunction. Diuresis is needed to correct Na levels, but caution should be taken due to the patient's poor renal function.

4. Macrocytic anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia, which is likely secondary to EtOH use. Folate and thiamine supplementation has been started, and it should be continued.

5. Coagulation abnormalities: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a potential bleeding risk. Vitamin K administration has been initiated, and ongoing monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
    - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr
   elevation, do not over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

   Disposition: CCU until surgery
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis post-porcine valve replacement in 2015, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. The patient is awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely this Wednesday.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention:

1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe, progressive dyspnea and syncopal episodes. He has a history of aortic stenosis with a bicuspid valve and previously underwent porcine valve placement in 2015. His current aortic valve area is 0.3, indicating critical stenosis. He is awaiting AVR surgery.

2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), with levels slightly improved from yesterday. His total bilirubin is stable at 2.0. The INR is stable at 1.4. The cause of transaminitis is likely hepatic congestion and significant alcohol ingestion prior to admission. The patient's hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, and tox screen was negative. Further evaluation for EBV and HSV may be considered.

   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, not at goal of -500cc, with a mild creatinine increase at 1.4
   from 1.3.
   - CT surgery following,  will assess if patient stable for surgery
   today.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Continues to trend downwards.  Hepatitis serologies
   and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was
   negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic
   congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Change ASA to 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety:
   - Will start 0.5mg PO Ativan

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a medical history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events. He was found to have cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He has been optimized for maximal diuresis, transaminitis is resolving, and his INR is 1.4. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, bicuspid valve, and previously underwent porcine valve placement in [**2155**]. He is currently awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely this Wednesday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's current condition of cardiogenic shock can lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion, potentially resulting in organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's critical aortic stenosis can cause symptoms such as dyspnea, syncope, and heart failure. If left untreated, it can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and potentially fatal outcomes.

3. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (transaminase levels) indicate liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause, which may include hepatic congestion due to heart failure.

4. Macrocytic Anemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr, do not
   over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
    ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis after porcine valve replacement in 2015, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. The patient has been medically optimized with maximal diuresis, transaminitis stable, INR 1.4, and is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low at 123, which may be secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response versus liver dysfunction. This condition is likely hypervolemic hyponatremia and typically responds to fluid restriction and diuresis.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are slightly elevated, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is slightly increased. This could indicate increasing decompensation with low increases over the last several days. Possible causes include hepatic congestion, significant alcohol ingestion prior to admission, or other factors.
3. PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: The patient has elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. There is no"
