   67 y/o blind, deaf male w/ESRD, s/p cath on [**8-24**] with stenting of
   distal LAD stenosis.  Patient had continued chest pain and was again
   taken to cath which was complicated by LMCA dissection and cardiac
   arrest.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cath [**8-24**]: LAD w/ 3 sequential stents widely patient. 50%
   lesion at D1 proximal to stents. 60% diffuse disease between 2nd and
   3rd stents; 90% focal lesion just distal to 3rd stent (new since [**5-6**]).
   D1 with proximal 90% disease (unchanged). New stent placed over distal
   LAD lesion. Procedure stopped prematurely secondary to patient
   agitation. Patient continued to have chest pain requiring nitroglycerin
   for chest pain overnight, EKG's consistently unchanged. Unrelieved with
   maalox, GI cocktail. Trop 0.63 morning of [**8-25**]. Was 0.97 at OSH.   The
   patient underwent a second cath with successful angioplasty to the D1
   and successful PCI of prox/mid LAD with DES.  This procedure was
   complicated by LMCA dissection which caused cardiac arrest requiring
   CPR, atropine, and intubation.  The LMCA dissection was corrected by
   LMCA stenting.
   -Continue Aspirin, plavix, lipitor
   -Start low dose metoprolol when patient off of pressors
   -Hold home Imdur
   -Continue to trend enzymes post LMCA dissection and cardiac arrest to
   evaluate extent of heart damage
   -EKG, ECHO in AM
   -Will add an ACE inhibitor when BP allows
   .
   # PUMP: Has known ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 35% on [**5-6**] Echo. No
   overt clinical signs of heart failure at this time. No peripheral
   edema, crackles, or JVD.
   -Will add an ACE inhibitor when BP allows
   .
   # RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Sinus rhythm today.
   -C/w amiodarone, start metoprolol when pressures stabilize off of
   pressors
   .
   # Hypotension: Currently on dopamine given peripherally with goal to
   maintain pressures above 90s-100s systolic
   -C/w metoprolol, ACE inhibitor when BP stable
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient intubated and sedated following code.  Continue
   Versed/Fentanyl as needed for sedation on vent.  Patient can likely be
   extubated tomorrow morning as vent settings are on assist control with
   Tidal volume=500 cc, Respiratory rate: 18, PEEP: 5 cm/h2o, FIO2: 50%.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct dropped from 30.9 pre-procedure to 24.8 post-procedure
   which is out of proportion to what would be an expected blood loss from
   cath.  Concern for retroperitoneal bleed.
   -Hct checks q8h
   -Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor post transfusion Hct
   -Premedicate with Tylenol 1 gram and Benadryl 25mg IV as patient has
   low grade temperature of 99.7

   Total time spent on patient care: 50 minutes.
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), ischemic cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and gout. He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to chest pain and continued to experience chest pain despite medical management. The procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection, leading to cardiac arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/69 mmHg to 117/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 37.2Â°C. The patient's blood glucose level is 140 mg/dL.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of creatinine (4.6 mg/dL), potassium (5.5 mEq/L), and lactic acid (0.7 mmol/L). The troponin-T level is elevated at 0.63 ng/mL, indicating myocardial injury. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 7.7 K/uL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary Arteries: The patient has significant coronary artery disease involving the distal left anterior descending artery ("

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old blind and deaf male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent coronary catheterization and stenting due to chest pain. However, the procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection and cardiac arrest. The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, and intubation. The LMCA dissection was corrected by LMCA stenting.

The patient's current medical conditions include ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypoxia, anemia, ESRD requiring hemodialysis (HD) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, gout, and congenital deafness.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F), heart rate (HR) of 85 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 112/69 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, except for the presence of a temporary HD catheter site which is clean and intact.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o blind, deaf male w/ESRD, s/p cath on [**8-24**] with stenting of
   distal LAD stenosis.  Patient had continued chest pain and was again
   taken to cath which was complicated by LMCA dissection and cardiac
   arrest.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cath [**8-24**]: LAD w/ 3 sequential stents widely patient. 50%
   lesion at D1 proximal to stents. 60% diffuse disease between 2nd and
   3rd stents; 90% focal lesion just distal to 3rd stent (new since [**5-6**]).
   D1 with proximal 90% disease (unchanged). New stent placed over distal
   LAD lesion. Procedure stopped prematurely secondary to patient
   agitation. Patient continued to have chest pain requiring nitroglycerin
   for chest pain overnight, EKG's consistently unchanged. Unrelieved with
   maalox, GI cocktail. Trop 0.63 morning of [**8-25**]. Was 0.97 at OSH.   The
   patient underwent a second cath with successful angioplasty to the D1
   and successful PCI of prox/mid LAD with DES.  This procedure was
   complicated by LMCA dissection which caused cardiac arrest requiring
   CPR, atropine, and intubation.  The LMCA dissection was corrected by
   LMCA stenting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old blind and deaf male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent cardiac catheterization on [**8-24**] due to continued chest pain. The procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection and cardiac arrest. The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, and intubation. The LMCA dissection was corrected by LMCA stenting. 

The patient's medical history includes ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35% and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He also has a history of peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia. 

Current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/69 to 117/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, creatinine level of 4.6 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.50 ng/mL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 28.8 mg/L. 

The patient has been extubated and is currently off pressors. He experienced one episode of chest pain that resolved after administering sublingual nitroglycerin. Medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, imdur, famotidine, and heparin sodium. 

Potential medical complications to consider include hypotension, hypoxia, anemia, gout, peptic ulcer disease, and potential heart damage from the LMCA dissection and cardiac arrest."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old blind and deaf male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent cardiac catheterization due to chest pain. The procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection and cardiac arrest, which required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, and intubation. The dissection was successfully corrected with LMCA stenting. The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated and sedated. He has multiple medical conditions including ischemic cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypoxia, anemia, gout, peptic ulcer disease, and ESRD requiring hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent LMCA dissection, there is a potential risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is currently intubated and sedated, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory infections.
3. Bleeding complications: The drop in hemoglobin concentration from 30.9 to 24.8 suggests a possible retroperitoneal bleed, especially considering the recent cardiac catheterization procedure. Close monitoring of blood parameters and prompt investigation if there are signs of bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old blind and deaf male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent cardiac catheterization due to continued chest pain. The procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection and cardiac arrest. The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, and intubation, and the dissection was corrected by LMCA stenting. The patient's current condition includes cough and sputum production, hypotension, hypoxia, anemia, ESRD, gout, peptic ulcer disease, and deafness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient has a cough and sputum production, which raises concern for HAP. Although the patient is afebrile, a chest X-ray (PA/lateral) may be considered to evaluate for any lung infiltrates or consolidation.
2. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent cardiac arrest during the catheterization, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and ongoing management of the patient's cardiac medications are essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient continues to have hypotension despite being on dopamine. Further evaluation and management of the patient's blood pressure should be done, including optimizing anti-hypertensive medication"

   67 y/o blind, deaf male w/ESRD, s/p cath on [**8-24**] with stenting of
   distal LAD stenosis.  Patient had continued chest pain and was again
   taken to cath which was complicated by LMCA dissection and cardiac
   arrest.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cath [**8-24**]: LAD w/ 3 sequential stents widely patient. 50%
   lesion at D1 proximal to stents. 60% diffuse disease between 2nd and
   3rd stents; 90% focal lesion just distal to 3rd stent (new since [**5-6**]).
   D1 with proximal 90% disease (unchanged). New stent placed over distal
   LAD lesion. Procedure stopped prematurely secondary to patient
   agitation. Patient continued to have chest pain requiring nitroglycerin
   for chest pain overnight, EKG's consistently unchanged. Unrelieved with
   maalox, GI cocktail. Trop 0.63 morning of [**8-25**]. Was 0.97 at OSH.   The
   patient underwent a second cath with successful angioplasty to the D1
   and successful PCI of prox/mid LAD with DES.  This procedure was
   complicated by LMCA dissection which caused cardiac arrest requiring
   CPR, atropine, and intubation.  The LMCA dissection was corrected by
   LMCA stenting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to chest pain. The procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection, leading to cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient has been producing green/yellow sputum, which raises concern for HAP. Although he is currently afebrile, further evaluation is needed, and a chest X-ray may be considered.
2. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) dropped significantly after the procedure, suggesting an unexpected blood loss. This raises concern for a retroperitoneal bleed, and close monitoring of Hct levels is recommended.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, necessitating the use of dopamine to maintain systolic pressures above 90s-100s. The cause of hypotension could be attributed to the recent cardiac events or potential complications from the catheterization procedure.
4. Hypoxia: The patient is currently intubated and sedated following the cardiac arrest. Oxygen supplementation is being provided, and weaning off ventilatory support may be considered soon.
5. Gout: The patient has a history of gout, and appropriate management should be continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has no known drug allergies and has been receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The review of systems shows no significant changes except for productive green/yellow sputum. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/64 mmHg to 117/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished and in no acute distress, although mildly diaphoretic. Physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles and bronchial breath sounds in the right posterior lung, indicating possible pulmonary edema or infection. The patient has poor dentition and right lower extremity edema, which may suggest peripheral arterial disease or venous thromboembolism. Neurologic examination is not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with decreased platelet count, creatinine, and potassium levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient is on multiple medications including heparin sodium, antibiotics, and nutritional support. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by ineffective communication and cardiac"

   67 y/o blind, deaf male w/ESRD, s/p cath on [**8-24**] with stenting of
   distal LAD stenosis.  Patient had continued chest pain and was again
   taken to cath which was complicated by LMCA dissection and cardiac
   arrest.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cath [**8-24**]: LAD w/ 3 sequential stents widely patient. 50%
   lesion at D1 proximal to stents. 60% diffuse disease between 2nd and
   3rd stents; 90% focal lesion just distal to 3rd stent (new since [**5-6**]).
   D1 with proximal 90% disease (unchanged). New stent placed over distal
   LAD lesion. Procedure stopped prematurely secondary to patient
   agitation. Patient continued to have chest pain requiring nitroglycerin
   for chest pain overnight, EKG's consistently unchanged. Unrelieved with
   maalox, GI cocktail. Trop 0.63 morning of [**8-25**]. Was 0.97 at OSH.   The
   patient underwent a second cath with successful angioplasty to the D1
   and successful PCI of prox/mid LAD with DES.  This procedure was
   complicated by LMCA dissection which caused cardiac arrest requiring
   CPR, atropine, and intubation.  The LMCA dissection was corrected by
   LMCA stenting.
   -Continue Aspirin, plavix, lipitor
   -cont metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   -cont Imdur
   -Continue to trend enzymes post LMCA dissection and cardiac arrest to
   evaluate extent of heart damage
   -lisinopril 2.5mg daily -> will hold anti-hypertensives pre-dialysis
   given low SBP 80s
   .
   # cough/sputum production:  concern for hospital-acquired PNA, although
   pt afebrile
   - will consider PA/lateral, defer empiric therapy for now
   # PUMP: Has known ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 35% on [**5-6**] Echo. No
   overt clinical signs of heart failure at this time. No peripheral
   edema, crackles, or JVD.
   -Will add an ACE inhibitor when BP allows
   .
   # RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Sinus rhythm today.
   -C/w amiodarone, start metoprolol yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Currently on dopamine given peripherally with goal to
   maintain pressures above 90s-100s systolic
   -C/w metoprolol, ACE inhibitor
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient intubated and sedated following code.  Continue
   Versed/Fentanyl as needed for sedation on vent.  Patient can likely be
   extubated tomorrow morning as vent settings are on assist control with
   Tidal volume=500 cc, Respiratory rate: 18, PEEP: 5 cm/h2o, FIO2: 50%.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct dropped from 30.9 pre-procedure to 24.8 post-procedure
   which is out of proportion to what would be an expected blood loss from
   cath.  Concern for retroperitoneal bleed.  Hct up to 27.6 this AM
   -Hct checks q8h
   -Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor post transfusion Hct
   -Premedicate with Tylenol 1 gram and Benadryl 25mg IV as patient has
   low grade temperature of 99.7

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.

   Nothing to add,
   Total time spent on patient care: 50 minutes.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient continued to experience chest pain overnight and underwent a second catheterization procedure, which resulted in successful angioplasty to the D1 segment and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the proximal/mid LAD with drug-eluting stent (DES). However, the procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection, leading to cardiac arrest that required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, and intubation. The LMCA dissection was corrected by LMCA stenting.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with ongoing monitoring and treatment for several conditions:

1. Chest pain: The patient continues to experience chest pain, which is concerning for hospital-acquired pneumonia (PNA). A chest X-ray may be considered, but empiric therapy will be deferred for now.

2. Hypotension: The patient is on dopamine to maintain blood pressures above 90s-100s systolic. Metoprolol and an ACE inhibitor will be added when the patient's blood pressure allows.

3. Hypoxia: The patient is intubated and sedated following the cardiac arrest. Ventilator settings will be adjusted to provide appropriate support"

   67 y/o blind, deaf male w/ESRD, s/p cath on [**8-24**] with stenting of
   distal LAD stenosis.  Patient had continued chest pain and was again
   taken to cath which was complicated by LMCA dissection and cardiac
   arrest.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cath [**8-24**]: LAD w/ 3 sequential stents widely patient. 50%
   lesion at D1 proximal to stents. 60% diffuse disease between 2nd and
   3rd stents; 90% focal lesion just distal to 3rd stent (new since [**5-6**]).
   D1 with proximal 90% disease (unchanged). New stent placed over distal
   LAD lesion. Procedure stopped prematurely secondary to patient
   agitation. Patient continued to have chest pain requiring nitroglycerin
   for chest pain overnight, EKG's consistently unchanged. Unrelieved with
   maalox, GI cocktail. Trop 0.63 morning of [**8-25**]. Was 0.97 at OSH.   The
   patient underwent a second cath with successful angioplasty to the D1
   and successful PCI of prox/mid LAD with DES.  This procedure was
   complicated by LMCA dissection which caused cardiac arrest requiring
   CPR, atropine, and intubation.  The LMCA dissection was corrected by
   LMCA stenting.
   -Continue Aspirin, plavix, lipitor
   -cont metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   -discontinue Imdur
   -lisinopril 2.5mg daily -> will hold anti-hypertensives pre-dialysis
   given SBP 90s to 100s

   # cough/sputum production:  concern for hospital-acquired PNA, although
   pt afebrile; no white count, but trending up
   - defer empiric therapy for now
   - if patient still has O2 requirement post-dialysis today, consider PA
   and lateral chest film and empiric antibiotic treatment of HAP
   # PUMP: Has known ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 35% on [**5-6**] Echo. No
   overt clinical signs of heart failure at this time. No peripheral
   edema, crackles, or JVD.
   -added ACE inhibitor

   # Hypotension: Initially managed with dopamine given peripherally with
   goal to maintain pressures above 90s-100s systolic, now off dopa, doing
   well
   -C/w metoprolol, ACE inhibitor
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient intubated and sedated following code.
   Versed/Fentanyl was needed for sedation on vent.  Patient now extubated
   .
   # Anemia: Hct dropped from 30.9 pre-procedure to 24.8 post-procedure
   which is out of proportion to what would be an expected blood loss from
   cath.  Concern for retroperitoneal bleed.  Hct up to 27.6 this AM
   -Hct checks q8h
   -Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor post transfusion Hct
   -Premedicate with Tylenol 1 gram and Benadryl 25mg IV as patient has

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting of the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to chest pain. The procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection, leading to cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent placement in the proximal/mid LAD and LMCA stenting.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, metoprolol, lisinopril (to be held pre-dialysis), and famotidine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 104/64 mmHg and heart rate of 78 bpm. He is on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 95%. His respiratory status is improved from previous days.

The patient has a cough and productive green/yellow sputum but no fever or white blood cell count elevation. His review of systems is otherwise unchanged from admission. Physical examination findings include mild diaphoresis, bibasilar crackles in the right posterior lung, and no lower extremity edema. His neurological examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and potassium levels. Troponin-T is within"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent stenting of the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis. He continues to experience chest pain and has been requesting nitroglycerin. His EKG has remained unchanged, and he did not have relief with Maalox or a gastrointestinal cocktail. His troponin level is elevated, which may indicate ongoing myocardial ischemia or component of congestive heart failure (CHF) and renal failure. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction, and has been on aspirin, Plavix, Imur, metoprolol, and Lipitor. He also has known cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35%. No overt signs of heart failure were observed during this time.

The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but is currently in sinus rhythm. He is on amiodarone and metoprolol for rhythm control. 

He experienced hypotension earlier in the day, which necessitated the administration of dopamine to maintain systolic pressures above 90s-100s. 

The patient's oxygen requirement has decreased after dialysis yesterday, making pneumonia unlikely.

His hemoglobin concentration dropped from 30.9% pre-procedure to 24.8% post-procedure, raising concerns about a retroperitoneal bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old blind and deaf male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a coronary angioplasty and stenting of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He continues to experience chest pain and has had two episodes of chest pain overnight, which were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin and a GI cocktail. The patient's EKG has remained unchanged. His troponin level is elevated, which may be due to a component of congestive heart failure (CHF) and renal failure, given the flat creatinine kinase (CK) level.

The patient is currently on multiple cardiac medications including aspirin, Plavix, imdur, metoprolol, and Lipitor. It is anticipated that he will also require imdur upon discharge for angina/burning chest pain. The patient is also on an ACE inhibitor, with stable blood pressure.

The patient has a known history of cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35% on a previous echocardiogram. There are no overt clinical signs of heart failure at this time. No peripheral edema, crackles, or jugular venous distention (JVD) were observed.

The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. He is being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol.

The patient is experiencing hypotension and is receiving dopamine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease, impaired physical mobility, and ineffective communication. He has been experiencing episodes of chest pain during dialysis sessions, which were relieved by sitting up and receiving sublingual nitrate. His cardiac medications were temporarily held due to hypotension earlier in the day. The patient also had another episode of chest pain at 3:30 AM, which was relieved with a GI cocktail. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/61 mmHg to 115/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 68 kg at admission to 75 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 660 mL and output of 1,500 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 840 mL. The patient is not receiving respiratory support and has an ABG result of ///32/. Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments. Lab results indicate elevated levels of potassium (K+), glucose, and troponin-T, while creatinine, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt) are within normal range. The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU, with ongoing monitoring and treatment for coronary"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 67 y/o blind, deaf male w/ESRD, s/p cath on [**8-24**]
   with stenting of distal LAD stenosis with continued to have chest pain
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cath [**8-24**]: LAD w/ 3 sequential stents widely patient. 50%
   lesion at D1 proximal to stents. 60% diffuse disease between 2nd and
   3rd stents; 90% focal lesion just distal to 3rd stent (new since [**5-6**]).
   D1 with prximal 90% disease (unchanged). New stent placed over distal
   LAD lesion. Procedure stopped prematurely secondary to patient
   agitation. Patient has continued to ask for nitroglycerin for chest
   pain overnight, including when he triggered this morning for same
   request. EKG's consistently unchanged. Unrelieved with maalox, GI
   cocktail. Trop 0.63 this morning. Was 0.97 at OSH. Elevated troponin
   may include component of CHF and renal failure, given flat CK.
   -Aspirin, plavix, imdur, metoprolol, lipitor; pt will likely need imdur
   upon d/c for angina/burning chest pain
   -added ACE inhibitor, BP stable
   -chest pain episodes yesterday resolved with SL NTG and then GI
   cocktail
   .
   # PUMP: Has known cardiomyopathy with EF 35% on [**5-6**] Echo. No overt
   clinical signs of heart failure at this time. No peripheral edema,
   crackles, or JVD.
   -on ACEi
   .
   # RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Sinus rhythm today.
   -C/w amiodarone, metoprolol
   .
   # Hypotension: Currently on dopamine given peripherally with goal to
   maintain pressures above 90s-100s systolic
   -C/w metoprolol, ACE inhibitor
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient intubated and sedated following code.  Continue
   Versed/Fentanyl as needed for sedation on vent.  Patient can likely be
   extubated tomorrow morning as vent settings are on assist control with
   Tidal volume=500 cc, Respiratory rate: 18, PEEP: 5 cm/h2o, FIO2: 50%
   - pt no longer has O2 requirement after dialysis yesterday, pneumonia
   unlikely.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct dropped from 30.9 pre-procedure to 24.8 post-procedure
   which is out of proportion to what would be an expected blood loss from
   cath.  Concern for retroperitoneal bleed.
   -Hct stable
   .
   # ESRD w/ HD on MWF: Underwent normal session of HD Friday morning
   prior to cath.
   -C/w Nephrocaps, renagel
   -F/u renal recs -> 1.5 liters removed yesterday during HD
   .
   # Gout
   -C/w allopurinol
   .
   # Congenital deafness: Can read lips effectively at baseline. Will
   involve ASL interpreters as needed when patient extubated.
   .
   # Peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia: Famotidine for now.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, consider OG tube feeds if not extubated tomorrow
   .
   ACCESS: PIV, HD cath

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 67-year-old blind and deaf male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a catheterization of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery with stenting due to significant stenosis.
- The patient continues to experience episodes of chest pain, which are relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin and a GI cocktail.
- The patient's vital signs show hypotension, with blood pressure readings ranging from 104/61 mmHg to 115/73 mmHg. His heart rate is within normal limits, and he has a sinus rhythm.
- The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35%, but no overt clinical signs of heart failure are currently present.
- The patient has been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but is currently in sinus rhythm.
- The patient requires dopamine to maintain blood pressures above 90s-100s systolic due to hypotension.
- The patient was intubated and sedated following a code but can likely be extubated tomorrow morning.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 30.9% pre-procedure to 24.8% post-procedure, raising concern for a retroperitoneal bleed.
- The patient has ESRD and requires"
