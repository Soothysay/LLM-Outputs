   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o M w/ ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, CKD s/p renal
   transplant, admit with acute on chronic systolic heart failure; now
   transfer to MICU with concern for acute UGIB.
   .
   # UGIB.  History of gastritis and esophagitis on past endoscopies. No
   known liver disease to suggest portal HTN/varices.  Also consider
   [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] with history of retching.  No EtOH, NSAID use, though
   does take coumadin and prednisone.  On PPI at baseline.  HCT stable
   thus far, but very early.  HD stable though slightly more tachy than
   baseline.  Given 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and DDAVP.  Since MICU admit, no
   further episodes of hematemesis.
   - IV PPI gtt x72hrs
   - GI following
   - Hold anti-HTNs for now.
   - Hold coumadin and ASA for now (?stents in place)
   - DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Diuresing on IV furosemide
   gtt and bolus chlorthiazide.
   - Cards/CHF team following, as well as renal for volume management.
   - Continue to hold lisinopril; not on BB.
   - O2 by nasal cannula, monitor sats.
   .
   #. Renal Failure and s/p renal transplant: Stably poor with diuresis
   (creatinine in mid-4 range).
   - strict I/O and weights
   - Hold ACEI as above for now.
   - Renal transplant following
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] level
   - Epo.
   .
   #. Diabetes: Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale.
   .
   #. RLE Wound: Stage 3-4. wound care consulting. Daily dressing changes
   for now, Wound care nurse attempting to get vac.
   .
   # CAD/HTN: continue imdur, hold hydral; hold ACE.  Hold ASA for now.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Despite aggressive IV diuresis.  Likely renal
   failure related.
   - COntinue PO bicarb.
   .
   # Postitive urine culture.  Continues to grow GNRs in urine (last
   [**3-7**]); previous culture with ESBL Klebs.  Team treating as colonizer.
   - f/u culture data; if hemodynamically unstable will treat despite
   likelihood that not truly causing infection.
   - check when last foley change (or change again)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and a previous renal transplant. He was admitted with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and is now being transferred to the MICU due to concern for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient has a history of gastritis and esophagitis, which could contribute to his current condition. He is also taking prednisone and coumadin, both of which may increase the risk of bleeding. However, no known liver disease or portal hypertension/varices were found. The patient is already on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy at baseline.

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and desmopressin (DDAVP) since being admitted to the MICU. There have been no further episodes of hematemesis.

The plan includes continuing IV PPI for 72 hours, following up with gastroenterology, holding anti-hypertensive medications for now, holding coumadin and aspirin, and administering DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.

In addition to the UGIB, the patient has other medical conditions such as acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD) post-renal transplant, and diabetes mellitus. The heart failure is being managed with diuretics, and the patient is also"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with a history of heart failure and chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently receiving aggressive diuresis with furosemide (Lasix) and chlorothiazide IV. Pantoprazole is being infused to manage stress ulcers. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate but stable blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a fluid balance of 2,865 mL total intake and 1,240 mL total output, with significant blood product transfusions. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of crackles at the right lung base and diminished breath sounds at the left lung base.

Physical examination reveals a sinus bradycardia with a systolic murmur and jugular venous distention (JVD) that appears to be up to the ear at 30 degrees. Peripheral pulses are absent in both lower extremities. The abdomen is soft but tender throughout, with worse pain around the periumbilical and epigastric regions. There is also 2+ stump edema in the right lower extremity, and bilateral finger amps are present. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and intact cranial nerves.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, CKD, and renal transplant. He was admitted with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and is now being transferred to the MICU due to concern for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has a history of gastritis and esophagitis, but no known liver disease to suggest portal hypertension or varices. He is on chronic hemodialysis and has been given 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and DDAVP for the bleeding. He is currently receiving IV pantoprazole, furosemide, and chlorothiazide. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient's history of gastritis and esophagitis, along with the current presentation, suggests an increased risk for UGIB. The use of anticoagulants (such as coumadin) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) further contribute to this risk. Immediate management includes administering IV proton pump inhibitors, ensuring NPO status, and preparing for endoscopy if the patient becomes unstable.

2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% puts him at high risk for systolic heart failure. The current presentation indicates worsening of this condition, necessitating aggressive"

   does take coumadin and prednisone.  On PPI at baseline.  HCT stable
   thus far, but very early.  HD stable though slightly more tachy than
   baseline.  Given 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and DDAVP.  Since MICU admit, no
   further episodes of hematemesis.
   - IV PPI gtt x72hrs, will plan to d/c gtt tomorrow and start PPI IV
   - GI recs contact if has rebleed, no plan for EGD currently given
   medical issues.
   - Hold coumadin and ASA for now (?stents in place)
   - DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.
   .
   #  Elevated INR:  INR off coumadin had been trending down
   appropriately, this AM [**3-11**] INR 4.4 of unclear reason.
   - recheck INR

   #. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Diuresing on IV furosemide
   gtt and bolus metolazone.  Started [**3-10**] on milrinone gtt and metoprolol
   for HR control, minimal improvement in diuresis with initiation of
   milrinone.
   - Cards/CHF, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] team following, as well as renal for volume
   management.
   - cont lasix gtt, cont metolazone.
   - started on milrinone gtt yesterday, cont milrinone gtt today per CHF
   team
   - Continue to hold lisinopril
   - cont inc metoprolol to 75mg tid, titrate up as tolerated for goal HR
   60-80
   - O2 by nasal cannula, monitor sats.
   .
   #. Renal Failure and s/p renal transplant: Stably poor with diuresis
   (creatinine in mid-4 range).
   - strict I/O and weights
   - Hold ACEI as above for now.
   - cont milrinone gtt
   - Renal transplant following, will discuss [**Last Name (un) **] dosing given low level
   - Epo.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic kidney disease post renal transplant, and diabetes. He was admitted with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has a history of gastritis and esophagitis, but no known liver disease or portal hypertension. He is currently receiving IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and will be transitioned to oral pantoprazole once the IV line is discontinued.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 104 bpm (normal range: 95-107 bpm), blood pressure of 108/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (normal range: 10-20 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, overweight/obese, pale conjunctiva, normal heart sounds with a murmur, crackles at the right lung base, diminished breath sounds at the left lung base, tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and peripheral edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination is largely unremarkable, but the patient struggles with orientation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic kidney disease, and a history of renal transplant. He was admitted with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and is now being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with concerns for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has a history of gastritis and esophagitis on past endoscopies, but no known liver disease to suggest portal hypertension or varices. He is taking coumadin and prednisone and has been on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy at baseline. His hematocrit (HCT) has been stable thus far, but it is still early. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and desmopressin (DDAVP). Since admission to the MICU, he has had no further episodes of hematemesis. The plan includes administering IV PPI for 72 hours, contacting the gastroenterology team if there are any rebleeding episodes, holding coumadin and aspirin for now, and using DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient is being diuresed with intravenous furosemide and metolazone. He has been started on milrin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 108/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is receiving multiple medications including furosemide, milrinone, pantoprazole, metoprolol, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CHF, there is a risk of worsening heart failure or development of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.

2. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction. This could be due to pre-existing kidney disease or acute kidney injury secondary to hypotension or medications.

3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's low blood pressure and low urine output may suggest inadequate tissue perfusion, which could lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's use of medications like pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). Renal recommendations include pursuing ultrafiltration but deferring to the CHF team, who recommend metolazone. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, milrinone, and pantoprazole. Social work consult for depression was also initiated.

The patient's allergies include erythromycin base, rash; protamine, unknown; and minoxidil, possibly hearing loss. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2139-3-11**]. The patient is currently receiving infusions of furosemide (Lasix) at 30 mg/hour, milrinone at 0.375 mcg/Kg/min, and pantoprazole (Protonix) at 8 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include metoprolol and morphine sulfate.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 104 bpm (sinus tachycardia), blood pressure ranging from 108/47 mmHg to 139/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 88.2 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,092 mL, with 252 mL being IV fluids. Total output was 1,610 mL, with 357 mL being urine output. The patient's blood products and NG output are also recorded. The respiratory support shows an oxygen saturation of 97% and ABG results of ///17/. The patient appears well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination findings include pale conjunctiva, a systolic murmur throughout the precordium, crackles at the right lung base, and diminished breath sounds at the left lung base. The patient has bilateral lower extremity amputations with 2+ stump edema. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness throughout the abdomen, particularly worse periumbilical to epigastric. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movement, and intact cranial nerves.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, slightly low sodium and potassium levels, and elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has a history of left above-knee amputation and right below-knee amputation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to dehydration and decreased renal perfusion.
2. Hypotension and hypoxemia due to heart failure exacerbation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and decreased venous return.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Infection at the amputation site due to compromised tissue integrity.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and stress on the heart.
7. Non-healing wounds or pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and poor perfusion."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 1 and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), which has improved, and is now being treated for congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's heart rate (HR) is elevated, and he is on several medications including milrinone, lopressor, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic HF: The patient's heart failure has not responded well to treatment, indicating a potential complication.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's high heart rate may indicate an underlying issue that needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): Although the bleeding has improved, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or other gastrointestinal complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged clotting times suggest a risk of bleeding or poor wound healing.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's poor urine output indicates worsening kidney function, which can lead to further complications.
6. Diabetic complications: The patient's diabetes may contribute to other complications such as infections or poor wound healing.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to limited mobility.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 20%, and a renal transplant. He was admitted with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and is now in the MICU due to concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient has been diuresing with IV furosemide and metolazone. He is currently on milrinone and metoprolol for heart rate control, but there has been minimal improvement in diuresis with the initiation of milrinone. His renal function is stable, but he will likely need dialysis, which needs to be discussed with the patient and family. The patient also has an elevated INR, possibly due to poor nutrition, and has received vitamin K. 

The patient's back pain is chronic and has been managed with morphine, but he will be switched to long-acting PO medications to avoid IV morphine. His diabetes is well-controlled with glargine and insulin sliding scale. He has a stage 3-4 RLE wound that requires wound care consulting and daily dressing changes. 

The patient's medications include PPI, metolazone, metoprolol, and hold on ACE inhibitors and aspirin. He also has a positive urine culture growing GNRs, which is being treated as a colonizer. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, and acute pain. The patient was admitted to the ICU with complaints of hypoglycemia and acute pain. Since admission, the patient's condition has been unstable with multiple interventions. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but there are concerns regarding fluid balance and respiratory support. The patient is receiving various medications including milrinone, metoprolol, furosemide, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels and prolonged PT/INR. The patient is expected to undergo hemodialysis and placement of a tunneled HD catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a potential risk for inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's pre-existing renal failure may worsen due to factors such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and inadequate filtration of waste products.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's history of GI bleed raises concerns for ongoing bleeding or re-bleeding, which could lead to hemodynamic instability and require urgent intervention.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia, which can be potentially life-threatening.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o M w/ ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, CKD s/p renal
   transplant, admit with acute on chronic systolic heart failure; now
   transfer to MICU with concern for acute UGIB.
   .
   # UGIB.  History of gastritis and esophagitis on past endoscopies. No
   known liver disease to suggest portal HTN/varices.  Also consider
   [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] with history of retching.  No EtOH, NSAID use, though
   does take coumadin and prednisone.  On PPI at baseline.  HCT stable
   thus far, but very early.  HD stable though slightly more tachy than
   baseline.  Given 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and DDAVP.  Since MICU admit, no
   further episodes of hematemesis.
   - IV PPI gtt x72hrs, will plan to d/c gtt tomorrow and start PPI IV
   - GI recs contact if has rebleed, no plan for EGD currently given
   medical issues.
   - Hold coumadin and ASA for now (?stents in place)
   - DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.
   .
   #  Elevated INR:  INR off coumadin had been trending down
   appropriately, this AM [**3-11**] INR 4.4 of unclear reason.
   - recheck INR
   - vit K po if recheck shows cont elevated INR
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Diuresing on IV furosemide
   gtt and bolus metolazone.  Started [**3-10**] on milrinone gtt and metoprolol
   for HR control, minimal improvement in diuresis with initiation of
   milrinone.
   - Cards/CHF, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] team following, as well as renal for volume
   management.
   - cont lasix gtt, cont metolazone.
   - started on milrinone gtt yesterday, cont milrinone gtt today per CHF
   team
   - Continue to hold lisinopril
   - cont inc metoprolol to 75mg tid, titrate up as tolerated for goal HR
   60-80
   - O2 by nasal cannula, monitor sats.
   .
   #. Renal Failure and s/p renal transplant: Stably poor with diuresis
   (creatinine in mid-4 range).
   - strict I/O and weights
   - Hold ACEI as above for now.
   - cont milrinone gtt
   - Renal transplant following, will discuss [**Last Name (un) **] dosing given low level
   - Epo.
   .
   #. Diabetes: Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale.  Blood
   glucose well controlled currently
   .
   #. RLE Wound: Stage 3-4. wound care consulting. Daily dressing changes
   for now, Wound care nurse attempting to get vac.
   .
   # CAD/HTN: continue metolazone, metoprolol; hold ACE.  Hold ASA for
   now.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Despite aggressive IV diuresis.  Likely renal
   failure related.
   - COntinue PO bicarb.
   .
   # Postitive urine culture.  Continues to grow GNRs in urine (last
   [**3-7**]); previous culture with ESBL Klebs.  Team treating as colonizer.
   - f/u culture data; if hemodynamically unstable will treat despite
   likelihood that not truly causing infection.
   - check when last foley change (or change again)
   .
   # FEN: regular diet as tolerated, d/c NGT
   # Prophylaxis: INR therapeutic currently, PPI gtt, not stooling
   currently, on bowel regimen
   # Access: PIV x 2;
   # Code: full
   # Dispo:  will remain in the MICU care while on milrinone gtt.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, CKD, and renal transplant. He was admitted with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and now transferred to the MICU with concern for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient has multiple medical issues, including gastritis and esophagitis on past endoscopies, no known liver disease to suggest portal hypertension/varices, and history of retching. He takes coumadin and prednisone, and is already on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) at baseline. The patient received 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and DDAVP since MICU admit, with no further episodes of hematemesis.

The plan includes IV PPI gtt x72hrs, with the intention to discontinue the gtt tomorrow and start PPI IV. The patient is advised to contact the GI team if he experiences rebleeding, with no current plan for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Coumadin and ASA are held, and DDAVP is given for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.

The patient also has an elevated INR of 6.5, with an unclear reason. The plan is to recheck the INR and administer vitamin K orally if it remains elevated. The patient is being diuresed with IV furosemide gtt and bolus metolazone for acute on chronic systolic heart failure. He was started on milrinone gtt and metoprolol for heart rate control, with minimal improvement in diuresis with initiation of milrinone. The CHF team is following up with the patient, as well as the renal team for volume management.

The patient has renal failure and is post-renal transplant, with stable diuresis but with creatinine in the mid-4 range. Strict input and output (I/O) and weights are being monitored, and ACE inhibitors are being held. The patient is also on milrinone gtt, and the renal transplant team will discuss dosing of [**Last Name (un) **] given the low level of Epo.

In terms of diabetes management, the patient is on glargine and insulin sliding scale, with well-controlled blood glucose levels. The patient has an RLE wound that is stage 3-4, and wound care consulting has been requested. Daily dressing changes are being performed, and a wound care nurse is attempting to obtain a vacuum-assisted closure (vac).

The patient has a history of CAD/HTN, and medications include metolazone, metoprolol, and holding ACE inhibitors. ASA is also being held for now. The patient has metabolic acidosis despite aggressive IV diuresis, which is likely related to renal failure. The plan is to continue PO bicarb.

The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure. The patient's wife requested 24 hours to contemplate dialysis, and the patient received an additional 5mg PO vitamin K to reverse INR. The plan is to proceed with catheter placement if the decision is made to go forward with dialysis. The patient's urine output has been zero, so Milrinone and Metoprolol drips were discontinued. The patient has allergies to erythromycin base, protamine, minoxidil, and unknown hearing loss. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is on various medications including Furosemide (Lasix) and Morphine sulfate.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/46 mmHg to 115/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 90.1 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 823 mL, with 573 mL given intravenously.

   transfer to MICU with concern for acute UGIB.
   .
   #. Renal Failure and s/p renal transplant: Stably poor with diuresis
   (creatinine in mid-4 range).  Patient with continually more uremic
   symptoms.  Mental status today [**3-12**] much worse with patient more
   delirious.  Wife reluctant to start dialysis.
   - will discuss with wife again today need for dialysis and dialysis
   catheter placement.   Milrinone gtt discontinued on [**3-12**] after no
   improvement in renal function or diuresis.
   - strict I/O and weights
   - Hold ACEI as above for now.
   - Renal transplant following, will discuss [**Last Name (un) **] dosing given low level
   - Epo.
   - increase sevelamer
   .
   # UGIB.  History of gastritis and esophagitis on past endoscopies. No
   known liver disease to suggest portal HTN/varices.  Also consider
   [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] with history of retching.  No EtOH, NSAID use, though
   does take coumadin and prednisone.  On PPI at baseline.  HCT stable
   thus far, but very early.  HD stable though slightly more tachy than
   baseline.  Given 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and DDAVP.  Since MICU admit, no
   further episodes of hematemesis.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI recs contact if has rebleed, no plan for EGD currently given
   medical issues.
   - Hold coumadin and ASA for now (?stents in place)
   - DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.
   .
   #  Elevated INR:  INR off coumadin had been trending down
   appropriately, but has increased significantly yesterday and remains
   elevated today. Received 5mg vit K on [**3-11**]. unclear reason, probably
   poor nutrition playing a role
   - recheck INR
   - vit K po again today
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Patient upon admission
   placed on IV furosemide gtt and bolus metolazone.  Started [**3-10**] on
   milrinone gtt and metoprolol for HR control, minimal improvement in
   diuresis with initiation of milrinone.  Decision to stop metoprolol and
   milrinone gtt on [**3-12**] due to minimal improvement and worsening uremic
   symptoms.
   - Cards/CHF, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] team following, as well as renal for volume
   management.
   - cont lasix gtt, cont metolazone.
   - Continue to hold lisinopril
   - O2 by nasal cannula, monitor sats.
   .
   #. Back pain: patient does have chronic back pain which today he states
   is [**7-6**].
   - ATC Tylenol
   - MS Contin
   #. Diabetes: Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale.  Blood
   glucose well controlled currently
   .
   #. RLE Wound: Stage 3-4. wound care consulting. Daily dressing changes
   for now, Wound care nurse attempting to get vac.
   .
   # CAD/HTN: continue metolazone; hold ACE.  Hold ASA for now.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Despite aggressive IV diuresis.  Likely renal
   failure related.  Will need dialysis.
   - COntinue PO bicarb.
   .
   # Possible depression: Patient denies depressive symptoms however
   appears down and will discuss further with him whether he would like
   this to be addressed.  Patient progressively more delirious since MICU
   admit, likely related to uremia from renal failure in addition to
   baseline depression.
   # Postitive urine culture.  Continues to grow GNRs in urine (last
   [**3-7**]); previous culture with ESBL Klebs.  Team treating as colonizer.
   - f/u culture data; if hemodynamically unstable will treat despite
   likelihood that not truly causing infection.
   - check when last foley change (or change again)
   .
   # FEN: regular diet as tolerated, discontinued NGT
   # Prophylaxis: INR therapeutic currently, PPI, not stooling currently,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, an EF of 20%, and a history of chronic kidney disease who underwent renal transplantation. He was admitted with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and is now being transferred to the MICU with concerns about acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's renal function has been progressively worsening, leading to increased uremic symptoms, and his mental status has deteriorated significantly. The patient's wife is reluctant to start dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and poor renal function post-transplantation. His current symptoms, including worsening mental status and delirium, suggest ongoing renal dysfunction.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction. His current presentation indicates worsening heart failure.
3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of gastritis and esophagitis, and there is concern for ongoing bleeding. He has received blood products and DDAVP to manage the bleeding.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely related to renal failure. This condition requires urgent attention and may necessitate dialysis.
5. Positive Urine Culture: The patient has a positive urine culture growing GNRs, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. However, the"

   delirious.  Wife reluctant to start dialysis.
   - will discuss with wife again today need for dialysis and dialysis
   catheter placement.   Milrinone gtt discontinued on [**3-12**] after no
   improvement in renal function or diuresis.  Lasix gtt d/c this AM [**3-13**]
   due to lack of response to lasix.
   - Tunnelled dialysis catheter today.  Will give 2u FFP and recheck INR
   in preparation for IR guided tunneled dialysis catheter.
   - Plan CVVH once dialysis catheter in place.

   further episodes of hematemesis.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI recs contact if has rebleed, no plan for EGD currently given
   medical issues.
   - Hold coumadin and ASA for now (?stents in place)
   - DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.
   .
   #  Elevated INR:  INR off coumadin had been trending down
   appropriately, but has increased significantly yesterday and remains
   elevated today. Received 5mg vit K on [**3-11**]. unclear reason, probably
   poor nutrition playing a role
   - INR improved today after po vit K yesterday.  Cont to trend INR.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic kidney disease, and a renal transplant. He was admitted with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and is now being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to concerns about upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient has been experiencing worsening uremic symptoms, including delirium, and his mental status has deteriorated further. His wife is reluctant to start dialysis. The patient's renal function has not improved despite diuretic therapy, so it has been decided to proceed with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) once a dialysis catheter is placed. 

The patient also has a history of gastritis and esophagitis, but there is no known liver disease to suggest portal hypertension or varices. He is on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) at baseline, and it will be continued. 

His coagulation profile shows an elevated INR of 22.6, which has improved after receiving vitamin K. The patient is currently receiving 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and desmopressin (DDAVP) due to significant renal dysfunction and ongoing bleeding. 

The patient's cardiovascular status is complicated by acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure. Despite initial treatment with IV furosem"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypotension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been admitted to the ICU due to worsening health condition.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/46 mmHg to 115/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received additional 5mg PO vitamin K to reverse INR and will need INR <3 for temporary catheters or INR <1.5 for tunneled catheter. No urine output has been observed, so Milrinone and Metoprolol drips have been discontinued.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of abdominal pain. The patient appears somewhat depressed and has a systolic murmur along with crackles at the right base. The patient also has tender abdomen, worse periumbilical to epigastric area, and reports pain throughout the abdomen. The patient has bilateral below-knee amputations with 2+ stump edema and is receiving bilateral finger amps. No rash or ja"

   transfer to MICU with concern for acute UGIB.
   .
   #. Renal Failure and s/p renal transplant: Stably poor with diuresis
   (creatinine in mid-4 range).  Patient with continually more uremic
   symptoms.  Mental status today [**3-12**] much worse with patient more
   delirious.  Wife reluctant to start dialysis.
   - will discuss with wife again today need for dialysis and dialysis
   catheter placement.   Milrinone gtt discontinued on [**3-12**] after no
   improvement in renal function or diuresis.  Lasix gtt d/c this AM [**3-13**]
   due to lack of response to lasix.  After discussion with wife in
   addition to patient becoming more uremic, decision was made to initiate
   dialysis on [**3-13**].  A tunneled HD catheter was placed by IR on [**3-13**] and
   CVVH was initiated with good response.
   - Per renal, will start HD today.
   - Renal transplant following, [**Last Name (un) **] dosing per renal
   - Epo
   - cont sevelamer

   # UGIB.  History of gastritis and esophagitis on past endoscopies. No
   known liver disease to suggest portal HTN/varices.  Also consider
   [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] with history of retching.  No EtOH, NSAID use, though
   does take coumadin and prednisone.  On PPI at baseline.  HCT stable
   thus far, but very early.  HD stable though slightly more tachy than
   baseline.  Given 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and DDAVP.  Since MICU admit, no
   further episodes of hematemesis.
   - cont PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI recs contact if has rebleed, no plan for EGD currently given
   medical issues.
   - cont to hold coumadin.
   - restart ASA today
   - DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.
   .
   #  Elevated INR:  INR off coumadin had been trending down
   appropriately, but has increased significantly yesterday and remains
   elevated today. Received 5mg vit K on [**3-11**]. unclear reason, probably
   poor nutrition playing a role.  Improved INR after receiving PO vit K.
   - Cont to trend INR.
   - will place on heparin gtt today for hx CHF
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Patient upon admission
   placed on IV furosemide gtt and bolus metolazone.  Started [**3-10**] on
   milrinone gtt and metoprolol for HR control, minimal improvement in
   diuresis with initiation of milrinone.  Decision to stop metoprolol and
   milrinone gtt on [**3-12**] due to minimal improvement and worsening uremic
   symptoms.  Lasix gtt d/c.  Patient placed on CVVH after tunneled HD
   line placed by IR on [**3-13**] with 2L off on first overnight of CVVH.
   - HD per renal today
   - will start ASA/heparin gtt today.
   - Cards/CHF, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] team following, as well as renal for volume
   management.
   - Continue to hold lisinopril
   .
   #. Back pain: patient does have chronic back pain which today he states
   is [**7-6**].   Pain now well controlled with ATC Tylenol and MS contin.
   - ATC Tylenol
   - will d/c MS Contin
   #. Diabetes: Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale.  Blood
   glucose well controlled currently
   - hypoglycemia today.  Will monitor blood sugars closely as pt is now
   starting on CVVH.
   - hold dose of lantus today as patient has been persistently
   hypoglycemic with FSBG in 30
   .
   #. RLE Wound: Stage 3-4. wound care consulting. Daily dressing changes
   for now, Wound care nurse attempting to get vac.
   .
   # CAD/HTN: hold ACE.  Hold ASA for now.
   - d/c metolazone
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Despite aggressive IV diuresis.  Likely renal
   failure related.
   - HD
   - Continue PO bicarb.
   .
   # Possible depression: Patient denies depressive symptoms however
   appears down and will discuss further with him whether he would like
   this to be addressed.  Patient progressively more delirious since MICU
   admit, likely related to uremia from renal failure in addition to
   baseline depression.
   # Postitive urine culture.  Continues to grow GNRs in urine (last
   [**3-7**]); previous culture with ESBL Klebs.  Team treating as colonizer.
   - f/u culture data; if hemodynamically unstable will treat despite
   likelihood that not truly causing infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic kidney disease, and a history of renal transplant. He was admitted with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and is now in the MICU due to concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
- The patient has been experiencing worsening uremic symptoms, including delirium, and has been unresponsive to diuretics. His renal function has not improved, leading to the decision to initiate dialysis.
- A tunneled hemodialysis (HD) catheter was placed, and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) was started, resulting in a good response.
- The patient's INR is elevated, and he received vitamin K, which improved it. Coumadin was held, and he will be placed on heparin.
- The patient was on IV furosemide and metolazone initially, but diuresis was minimal. Milrinone was started but discontinued due to no improvement in renal function or diuresis. Lasix was also discontinued.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o M w/ ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, CKD s/p renal
   transplant, admit with acute on chronic systolic heart failure; now
   transfer to MICU with concern for acute UGIB.
   .
   #. Renal Failure and s/p renal transplant: Stably poor with diuresis
   (creatinine in mid-4 range).  Patient with continually more uremic
   symptoms.  Mental status today [**3-12**] much worse with patient more
   delirious.  Wife reluctant to start dialysis.
   - will discuss with wife again today need for dialysis and dialysis
   catheter placement.   Milrinone gtt discontinued on [**3-12**] after no
   improvement in renal function or diuresis.  Lasix gtt d/c this AM [**3-13**]
   due to lack of response to lasix.  After discussion with wife in
   addition to patient becoming more uremic, decision was made to initiate
   dialysis on [**3-13**].  A tunneled HD catheter was placed by IR on [**3-13**] and
   CVVH was initiated with good response.
   - Cont CVVH vs. HD per renal
   - Renal transplant following, [**Last Name (un) **] dosing per renal
   - Epo
   - cont sevelamer
   .
   # UGIB.  History of gastritis and esophagitis on past endoscopies. No
   known liver disease to suggest portal HTN/varices.  Also consider
   [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] with history of retching.  No EtOH, NSAID use, though
   does take coumadin and prednisone.  On PPI at baseline.  HCT stable
   thus far, but very early.  HD stable though slightly more tachy than
   baseline.  Given 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and DDAVP.  Since MICU admit, no
   further episodes of hematemesis.
   - cont PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI recs contact if has rebleed, no plan for EGD currently given
   medical issues.
   - cont coumadin and ASA for now (?stents in place)
   - DDAVP for bleeding in the setting of significant renal dysfunction.
   .
   #  Elevated INR:  INR off coumadin had been trending down
   appropriately, but has increased significantly yesterday and remains
   elevated today. Received 5mg vit K on [**3-11**]. unclear reason, probably
   poor nutrition playing a role.  Improved INR after receiving PO vit K.
   - Cont to trend INR.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Patient upon admission
   placed on IV furosemide gtt and bolus metolazone.  Started [**3-10**] on
   milrinone gtt and metoprolol for HR control, minimal improvement in
   diuresis with initiation of milrinone.  Decision to stop metoprolol and
   milrinone gtt on [**3-12**] due to minimal improvement and worsening uremic
   symptoms.  Lasix gtt d/c.  Patient placed on CVVH after tunneled HD
   line placed by IR on [**3-13**] with 2L off on first overnight of CVVH.
   - Cont CVVH per renal.
   - Cards/CHF, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] team following, as well as renal for volume
   management.
   - Continue to hold lisinopril
   .
   #. Back pain: patient does have chronic back pain which today he states
   is [**7-6**].   Pain now well controlled with ATC Tylenol and MS contin.
   - ATC Tylenol
   - MS Contin
   #. Diabetes: Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale.  Blood
   glucose well controlled currently
   - hypoglycemia today.  Will monitor blood sugars closely as pt is now
   starting on CVVH.
   .
   #. RLE Wound: Stage 3-4. wound care consulting. Daily dressing changes
   for now, Wound care nurse attempting to get vac.
   .
   # CAD/HTN: hold ACE.  Hold ASA for now.
   - d/c metolazone
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Despite aggressive IV diuresis.  Likely renal
   failure related.
   - CVVH
   - Continue PO bicarb.
   .
   # Possible depression: Patient denies depressive symptoms however
   appears down and will discuss further with him whether he would like
   this to be addressed.  Patient progressively more delirious since MICU
   admit, likely related to uremia from renal failure in addition to
   baseline depression.
   # Postitive urine culture.  Continues to grow GNRs in urine (last
   [**3-7**]); previous culture with ESBL Klebs.  Team treating as colonizer.
   - f/u culture data; if hemodynamically unstable will treat despite
   likelihood that not truly causing infection.
   - check when last foley change (or change again)
   .
   # FEN: regular diet as tolerated
   # Prophylaxis: INR therapeutic currently, PPI, not stooling currently,
   on bowel regimen
   # Access: PIV x 2; will need HD access
   # Code: DNR, not DNI.
   # Dispo:  ICU care until CVVH d/c.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic kidney disease (CKD) status post renal transplant, and admitted with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure. He also has a history of gastritis and esophagitis, and is currently being treated in the ICU for possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), renal failure, and other medical complications.

24-hour events:
- A tunneled hemodialysis (HD) catheter was placed after administering fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to an elevated INR.
- Continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) was initiated overnight.
- The patient's intake and output (I/O) balance improved due to the initiation of CVVH.
- A peripherally inserted percutaneous catheter (PPC) was placed in the left ventral forearm for access.
- The patient's blood pressure (BP) has been stable, with a slight increase in heart rate (HR).
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 2 units of FFP, and desmopressin (DDAVP).
- No further episodes of hematemesis have occurred since admission to the MICU.
- The patient's mental status has worsened, and he is now more delirious.
- The wife is reluctant to start dialysis."

","The patient's chief complaints are congestive heart failure (CHF) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, depression, pain, anemia, coagulopathy, and mental status changes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are well-nourished and not in acute distress. Their cardiovascular examination shows a normal S1 and S2 with distant heart sounds. The respiratory examination is clear bilaterally with symmetric chest expansion. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. The extremities show bilateral above-knee amputations (AKAs). The musculoskeletal examination is unable to stand. The neurologic examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person and hospital, and movement and tone assessments are not performed.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, low hemoglobin (Hct), elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and platelet count. The electrolyte levels show imbalances in sodium,"
