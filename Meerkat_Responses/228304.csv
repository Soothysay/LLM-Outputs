","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, diabetes mellitus (hypoglycemic coma), and recent intra-cranial hemorrhage. She was admitted two weeks ago with mental status changes due to hypercarbia. The patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and underwent a sleep study with preliminary settings of 20/8. After discharge, she was not given bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) therapy, leading to somnolence in the morning. She was then transferred to another hospital but did not continue with BIPAP. On arrival, her pH was 7.25, and she required invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is a serious condition that requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Infection: The presence of erythema and marked boundaries on the left leg raises concerns for potential infection or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
3. Hypoglycemia: As a diabetic patient, the patient is at risk of hypoglycemia, particularly if insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications are not managed properly.
4. Pneumonia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, diabetes mellitus, and recent intra-cranial hemorrhage. She was admitted two weeks ago with mental status changes due to hypercarbia, which was felt to be secondary to obstructive sleep apnea/obstructive hypoventilation syndrome (OSA/OHS). The patient underwent a sleep study with preliminary settings of 20/8 and was not given bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) after discharge. Upon arrival at this hospital, her pH was 7.25, PaCO2 was 152, and she had a respiratory rate of 70. She was maintained on apneic care (apneic on pressure support). The patient required invasive ventilation at 08:15 PM and has been intubated. Allergies include Motrin (Ibuprofen) and latex. She has been receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis since 12:47 AM. Other ICU medications include RISS, Xalatan, glipizide, rosiglitazone, acebutalol, Keppra, simvastatin, PPI, fluticasone, and Peridex.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/41 to 160/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 inspiratory/min, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her weight remains unchanged at 134 kg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,035 mL and output of 2,835 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 200 mL. The patient is receiving oxygen via an endotracheal tube and is on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, pressure support (PS) of 10 cmH2O, respiratory rate (RR) of 10, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. RSBI is 101, plateau pressure (Plateau) is 30 cmH2O, compliance is 14 cmH2O/mL, and SpO2 is 92%. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 85, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 197, and base excess (BE) of -4. The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, intubation, responsiveness to voice and sternal rub but not following commands, regular heart sounds with a right-sided S3, clear anterior lungs, decreased bowel sounds, 1+ edema, and left leg with erythema and marked boundaries.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.3 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 196 K/uL, blood glucose of 140 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 140 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 3.5 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 101 mEq"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss after hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and asthma. She was admitted previously with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status. The patient has a diagnosis of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN).

The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated in the morning. However, there are concerns for possible aspiration post-extubation, so she is being kept NPO (nothing by mouth). The patient's left lower extremity ultrasound showed no deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but there is erythema of the left leg, which improved with elevation. An echocardiogram was not done yet.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/43 mmHg to 180/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 134 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,090 mL and output of 1,180 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 910 mL. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She also has a recent left temporal hemorrhage, possibly related to hypertension and anticoagulation. The patient's blood sugars have been poorly controlled despite adjustments in her diabetes regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and intubation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular chest X-rays will be necessary to prevent and manage these complications.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension increases the risk of cardiac events. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and blood pressure is essential to prevent further complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.

3. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's recent left temporal hemorrhage raises concerns about the potential for further bleeding events, especially considering the use of anticoagulant medications. Monitoring for signs of rebleeding"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and previous admissions for subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute change in mental status. 

The patient was readmitted with acute change in mental status and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The note mentions a new right lung collapse on chest X-ray, likely due to mucous plugging. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, indicating poor ventilation in the setting of acute right lung collapse.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration: The patient had coughing and desaturation with one sip of water post-extubation, which is concerning for aspiration. This could lead to pneumonia or other respiratory infections.

2. Right lung collapse: The patient's chest X-ray showed whiteout of the right lung with rightward tracheal deviation, indicating a new right lung collapse. This could be caused by mucous plugging and may require interventions such as bronchoscopy for deep suctioning.

3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, indicating inadequate ventilation leading to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can result in respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was admitted previously for an acute change in mental status and is currently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, likely due to poor ventilation resulting from a new right lung collapse. There is also concern for aspiration, possibly requiring intubation. Additionally, the patient has a recent left temporal hemorrhage, unclear etiology, and is on anticoagulation therapy. She is in sinus rhythm but experiences paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and is being treated for these conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure with new right lung collapse: This condition can lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and acidosis if not properly managed.
2. Concern for aspiration: Aspiration can result in pneumonia, which may require mechanical ventilation and antibiotics.
3. Recent left temporal hemorrhage: This could lead to neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, or seizures.
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: If left untreated,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/43 to 136/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is also experiencing chest discomfort, and further evaluation for cardiac events is recommended.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Kidney function appears to be within normal limits based on creatinine levels. Electrolyte levels show slightly low potassium and normal sodium, chloride, and magnesium levels. Glucose levels are elevated.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion with rhonchorous breath sounds, cool skin, and signs of obesity. Neurological examination shows the patient attentive and oriented, but further assessment is needed for movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes.

The patient's plan includes managing hypertension with nitroglycerin and hydralazine, assessing for extubation, diuresis with lasix and acetazolamide, holding narcotics/sedatives, considering discontinuation of oral hypoglycemics for diabetes management, and evaluating potential infection or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss, hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was admitted with acute change in mental status and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been intubated due to a traumatic tracheal tear found on chest CT and flexible bronchoscopy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal tear - The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear, which requires prolonged intubation to allow for healing. There is a risk of complications associated with long-term intubation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheal stenosis, or infection at the site of intubation.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure with right lung collapse - The patient has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is evidence of right lung collapse. This could be due to mucous plugging or aspiration. The patient may require further interventions to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Altered mental status - The patient has an altered mental status with unclear etiology. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, and the patient's mental status should be closely monitored.
4. Concern for aspiration - The patient had coughing and desaturation after taking a sip of water, suggesting a risk of aspiration. This concern should be addressed to prevent aspiration pneumonia.
5. Left temporal hemorrhage - The patient has a left temporal hemorrhage with unclear etiology. It is less likely due to trauma and more likely related to hypertension and anticoagulation. Monitoring clinically and holding anticoagulation medications are recommended.
6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation therapy may be required, but it needs to be carefully managed given the recent hemorrhage.
7. Type II diabetes mellitus - The patient has type II diabetes mellitus. Insulin therapy may be required, especially during periods of NPO status.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications in the ICU setting."

   TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due
   to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot
   be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
   minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.

 Continued evolution of left medial temporal intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage, without evidence of new hemorrhage.

 1. Probable pulmonary hypertension. No emboli in the main,
   right, left, or lobar pulmonary arteries, peripheral circulation is not
   evaluated by this study.  2. Right lower lobe collapse and
   heterogeneous opacification in the right upper lobe and lingual, more
   likely aspiration than pneumonia at this stage, are sufficient to
   explain hypoxia.  3. Tracheomalacia. Upper tracheal mass or organized
   secretions or aspirated material. Bronchoscopy recommended.  4.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss, hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). She was recently readmitted to the hospital with acute change in mental status and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated due to a traumatic tracheal tear, which was discovered on chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) and confirmed during flexible bronchoscopy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal tear: The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear, which is a serious condition that requires prolonged intubation to allow the tear to heal. There is a risk of complications such as tracheal stenosis or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. This condition may worsen if the patient develops further lung collapses or if there are issues with ventilation.
3. Right lung collapse: The patient has a right lung collapse, likely due to mucous plugging. If not properly managed, this can lead to pneumonia or further respiratory complications.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was previously admitted with acute change in mental status. She has been readmitted with acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently intubated due to a traumatic tracheal tear.

The patient's tracheal tear was discovered on chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) and confirmed by flexible bronchoscopy. She underwent fiberoptic intubation and will remain intubated for two weeks to allow the tear to heal. Prophylactic antibiotics, including Unasyn and fluconazole, have been started. Serial chest X-rays will be followed.

The patient also has hypercarbic respiratory failure with a new right lung collapse. This is likely due to mucous plugging given her thick secretions. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, indicating poor ventilation in the setting of acute right lung collapse. Serial ABGs via arterial line, continued diuresis with lasix as tolerated, and continued use of flovent, albuterol, and atrovent will be continued.

The patient's altered mental status is unclear etiology. Her head CT is unchanged, chest CTA is without pulmonary embolism"

   TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due
   to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot
   be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
   minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
   NCHCT
 Continued evolution of left medial temporal intraparenchymal
   hemorrhage, without evidence of new hemorrhage.
   CTA Chest
 1. Probable pulmonary hypertension. No emboli in the main,
   right, left, or lobar pulmonary arteries, peripheral circulation is not
   evaluated by this study.  2. Right lower lobe collapse and
   heterogeneous opacification in the right upper lobe and lingual, more
   likely aspiration than pneumonia at this stage, are sufficient to
   explain hypoxia.  3. Tracheomalacia. Upper tracheal mass or organized
   secretions or aspirated material. Bronchoscopy recommended.  4.
   Probably pulmonary arterial hypertension.

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and a recent admission for subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was readmitted with acute change in mental status and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated after finding of a traumatic tracheal tear.

The patient has several potential medical complications:
1. HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with enalapril.
2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS): The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as tracheal tear, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and right lung collapse.
3. DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: The patient has a history of type II diabetes and is currently being managed with insulin.
4. TRACHEAL TEAR: The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear that requires prolonged intubation to allow for healing. She is also on prophylactic antibiotics (Unasyn and fluconazole).
5. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to her recent subarachnoid hemorrhage or other underlying conditions.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy in the operating room, where a 5cm tear in the trachea was visualized. The patient was subsequently intubated using fiberoptics.

The patient has a history of allergies to Motrin (Ibuprofen), latex, and unknown allergens. The patient is currently on several medications, including Fentanyl, Propofol, Metoprolol, Heparin Sodium, and others.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/44 mmHg to 199/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is 134 kg, and height is 65 inches.

The patient's respiratory support consists of invasive ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 108 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 42 mmHg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and type II diabetes mellitus. She was recently admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status and acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is now intubated after finding a traumatic tracheal tear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, which may require ongoing monitoring and management.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been variable, and she has been on medication for hypertension. It is important to monitor and control her blood pressure to prevent complications such as heart attack or stroke.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and ongoing respiratory support may be required.
4. Tracheal Tear: The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear, for which she will undergo tracheostomy today. This will allow the tear to heal over an 8-week period.
5. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's right lung collapse may contribute to her respiratory failure. Measures to clear secretions and improve ventilation may be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss after hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and previous admissions for subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute change in mental status. She was readmitted with acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and now intubated after finding a traumatic tracheal tear. 

Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, which may require further investigation and management.
2. Hypertension: The patient has variable blood pressure readings, indicating uncontrolled hypertension.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to intubation due to a traumatic tracheal tear.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has type II diabetes, which requires ongoing management, especially during her current hospitalization.
5. Traumatic Tracheal Tear: The patient has a confirmed traumatic tracheal tear, for which a tracheostomy is planned to allow the tear to heal.
6. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure with Right Lung Collapse: The patient initially had a right lung collapse, likely due to mucous plugging, and required interventions to improve oxygenation.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, with unclear"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and type II diabetes mellitus. She was admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and later readmitted with acute change in mental status and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated due to a traumatic tracheal tear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal tear - The patient has a confirmed tracheal tear, which will require a tracheostomy for healing.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure with new right lung collapse caused by mucous plugging. This requires careful monitoring and management.
3. Aspiration - The patient has a high risk of aspiration, especially post-extubation, which may require close monitoring and possible elective tracheostomy.
4. Anemia - The patient has a history of anemia, but the current hemoglobin level is stable and hemolysis labs are negative.
5. Hypertension - The patient has a history of hypertension, and her blood pressure is being managed with enalapril.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and type II diabetes mellitus. She was admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient now presents with a traumatic tracheal tear, intrathoracic bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, right lung collapse, altered mental status, concern for aspiration, recent left temporal hemorrhage, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal tear: The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear, which requires intubation for at least 2 weeks to allow healing. Prophylactic antibiotics are being administered to prevent infection. Serial chest X-rays will be done to monitor the healing process.

2. Intrathoracic bleeding: The patient has a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and pleural effusions, which could indicate intrathoracic bleeding. Close monitoring of Hct levels and repeat chest X-rays are recommended. If the effusion worsens, a CT scan and thoracentesis may be considered.

3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to mucous plugging"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss, hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was recently admitted with acute change in mental status and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent fiberoptic intubation due to a traumatic tracheal tear found on chest CT and flexible bronchoscopy. She then had a tracheostomy performed. 

The patient's current conditions include tracheal tear, hypercarbic respiratory failure with new right lung collapse, rising temperature possibly indicating impending infection, HCT drop, altered mental status, concern for aspiration, recent left temporal hemorrhage, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 141/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, glucose level of 131 mg/dL, sodium level of 147 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L, and an elevated lactate level of 6.4 K/uL.

The patient's plan of care includes trying a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today, placing a nasogastric tube (NGT) for feeding and medications, continuing diuresis with lasix as tolerated, and providing prophylactic antibiotics while intubated. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, tracheal stenosis, infection (due to tracheostomy and NGT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pressure ulcers. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration or complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss, hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and later readmitted for acute change in mental status. She has a history of acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated due to a traumatic tracheal tear. The patient underwent fiberoptic intubation and will undergo a tracheostomy today to allow the tracheal tear to heal. She also has hypercarbic respiratory failure with new right lung collapse, likely due to mucous plugging. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows hypoxia and metabolic alkalosis. The patient's altered mental status is unclear in etiology, with no clear complaints. Head CT is unchanged, chest CTA shows no pulmonary embolism, and there is no evidence of myocardial infarction or significant urinary abnormalities. The patient had a recent left temporal hemorrhage, possibly due to hypertension and anticoagulation. There is no evidence of rebleeding or new bleed on head CT. The patient is on Unasyn prophylactically for tracheal tear. She has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient's blood pressure has been variable, requiring nitro drip"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient was readmitted with acute change in mental status and acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was found to have a traumatic tracheal tear, which has been addressed with tracheostomy placement.

The patient's current condition includes fever (101.3), hypertension, altered mental status, anemia, respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, and there are concerns about hypercarbic respiratory failure, potential infection, hypernatremia, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and low-grade leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an impending infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Aspiration: The patient has a concern for aspiration due to her altered mental status and recent tracheostomy. Proper airway protection measures should be implemented.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been immobilized and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). She was readmitted with acute change in mental status and acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear, for which she underwent fiberoptic intubation and is now tracheostomized. She also has hypercarbic respiratory failure due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CO2 retention, and right lung collapse. The patient's temperature has been rising, and there are concerns about impending infection or post-operative complications. There are also concerns about hypernatremia, anemia, hypertension, altered mental status, potential aspiration, recent left temporal hemorrhage, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's rising temperature and low-grade leukocytosis raise concerns about a potential infection. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection and consider appropriate cultures and antibiotic therapy.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels indicate hypernatremia. This condition can lead to dehydration and neurological complications. Treatment options include administering D5W and considering NGT placement with free"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, anemia, tracheobronchial disease, and respiratory failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of fever, respiratory failure, and an unknown cause of tracheobronchial injury.

On review of systems, the patient has no significant changes except for fever. His vital signs show a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1000 mL of IV fluids and output of 1270 mL including 770 mL of urine. His weight remains unchanged at 134 kg.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving various medications including metoprolol, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and antibiotics.

The patient's tracheobronchial injury is not of known origin. He has a fever and signs of respiratory failure. His condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management. Potential medical complications that could arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress"

","Summary:
- The patient is in the ICU with respiratory failure and a tracheal tear.
- The tracheal tear occurred during intubation and an indwelling tracheostomy tube has been placed to bypass the injured area.
- The patient has a history of chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or possibly obstructive hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), as well as a central cause.
- The patient's blood pressure is better controlled today and they will start enalapril when the nasogastric (NG) tube is in place.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type II and is on SSRI medication.
- The patient has left leg erythema, which is chronic according to the husband, and there is a new culture from a swab taken after tracheal placement.
- The patient's mental status is alert and interactive, and sedation will be weaned as tolerated.
- The plan is to wean off the ventilator, replace free water when the NG tube is in place, and start tube feeds.
- The arterial line will be pulled today, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal tear: The patient has a tracheal tear, which can lead to ongoing air leakage and potential respiratory distress."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with respiratory failure and tracheal tear. He has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and mental status changes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 151/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

24-hour events include fever, refusal of NG tube, and secretions. The patient's allergies include anaphylaxis to Motrin (Ibuprofen) and latex. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including fluconazole and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of left leg erythema, which is chronic according to the patient's husband. The patient's physical examination reveals no new findings.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values, including kidney function and liver enzymes, are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. Tracheal tear: presumed to have occurred during intubation at the start of the prior admission. The patient has an IP (likely tracheostomy) placed yesterday to bypass the injured area"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and type II diabetes mellitus. She was recently admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted due to acute change in mental status, acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, and a traumatic tracheal tear. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently intubated.

The patient's respiratory issues are likely a combination of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CO2 retention, and complications from her hospital course, including right lung collapse and mainstem intubation. She remains on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has shown signs of fever, hypothermia, and low-grade leukocytosis, which may indicate an impending infection, especially post-operatively from the tracheostomy. Further investigations are recommended, including a pan culture and stool test for Clostridium difficile.

She also has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W at 75 cc/hr, and her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has dropped but is now stable with no evidence of melena or hemolysis. A repeat chest X-ray showed no worsening effusions, making intrathoracic bleeding unlikely.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and recent admissions for subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute change in mental status. The patient was admitted due to acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and found to have a traumatic tracheal tear, which has since been repaired with tracheostomy placement.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with recent afebrile periods. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection or inflammation.

2. Tracheobronchial disease, other (trachea/bronchus, including injury): The patient has a history of traumatic tracheal tear, which has been repaired. Close monitoring of respiratory status and airway patency is crucial to prevent complications such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or tracheal stenosis.

3. Anemia, other: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic conditions or acute blood loss. Monitoring hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and considering transfusion if symptomatic or significantly low is essential.

4. Hypertension, benign: The patient's blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss, hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted previously for a subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute mental status changes. She has a diagnosis of traumatic tracheal tear, which has been repaired through tracheostomy. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely caused by obstructive sleep apnea, CO2 retention, and hospital course complications including right lung collapse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's rising temperature and low-grade leukocytosis may indicate an impending infection. Further investigations, such as a pan culture and stool for Clostridium difficile, should be done to rule out infection. 

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be corrected with D5W at 75 cc/hr. If a nasogastric tube (NGT) placement is considered, free water flushes should also be given. Changing the antibiotic solution to D5W might be necessary.

3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and her HCT has dropped. However, hemolysis labs are negative, and a repeat chest X-ray did not show worsening effusions. The concern for intrathoracic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a tracheal tear that occurred during intubation, and an IP tracheostomy tube was placed yesterday to bypass the injured area. She has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep-related breathing disorders. The patient's hypertension is better controlled today, and she will start taking enalapril when the nasogastric tube is in place. She will also receive PRN hydralazine to help with blood pressure control and achieve a negative fluid balance of 500cc-1L. The patient has type II diabetes mellitus and left leg erythema, which is being treated with antibiotics. Her mental status is alert and interactive but intermittently confused, and she will be closely monitored. A head CT scan for MS changes was performed last week. The remainder of the plan is per the resident note.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Tracheal tear and subsequent respiratory infections: The patient has a tracheal tear, which increases the risk of respiratory infections due to the compromised airway.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's"

   Patient is critically ill. Total time spent: 32 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and asthma. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subsequently readmitted with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has a tracheal tear, presumably occurred during intubation at the start of her prior admission. An tracheostomy tube was placed yesterday to bypass the injured area, and she is receiving empiric antibiotic coverage including antifungal coverage for 10 days.

The patient also has chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obstructive hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), or central component. She requires ventilator weaning and confirmation with gas pre and post CPAP.

The patient has hypertension, which is better controlled today. She will start taking enalapril when the nasogastric (NG) tube is in place, and will receive PRN hydralazine to control blood pressure. Additionally, she will be started on lasix with a goal of negative fluid balance of 500cc-1L negative to help with blood pressure management.

The patient has type II diabetes mellitus (DM"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted previously with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status. The patient has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and a traumatic tracheal tear that required a tracheostomy.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation and has failed spontaneous breathing trials. She appears to have component of hypercarbic respiratory failure likely from central apnea, as well as mild pulmonary edema. Hypoxia may be caused by atelectasis or fluid overload, but improves with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Pulmonary embolism is in the differential diagnosis but is less likely.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been variable and required a nitro drip at one point. She is currently on enalapril and hydralazine for blood pressure control.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved but is still frequently confused. Possible causes include prior hemorrhage, hypoglycemic coma, and ICU delirium. Head CT unchanged, and other tests have ruled out other potential causes.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was recently admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted with acute change in mental status, acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a traumatic tracheal tear and underwent tracheostomy. She continues to have difficulty with PSV trials due to central apnea and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, altered mental status, hypernatremia, concern for aspiration, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and remains on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for ongoing respiratory issues, including pulmonary edema.
2. Tracheal Tear: The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear that required tracheostomy. There is a risk of complications related to the tracheostomy site and healing of the tear.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can lead to irregular heart rhythms and potential cardiac complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that requires medication management. Uncontrolled hypertension may lead to further cardiovascular complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and previous admissions for subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute change in mental status. She is currently in the ICU due to acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, a traumatic tracheal tear, and other medical conditions.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to central apnea, obstructive sleep apnea, and carbon dioxide retention. She remains on mechanical ventilation.
2. Traumatic Tracheal Tear: The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear, which required fiberoptic intubation and subsequent tracheostomy to allow the tear to heal.
3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which were managed by holding beta-blockers and considering intermittent nodal agents.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been variable, with episodes of hypertension requiring nitro drip and low blood pressure with high pulse pressure.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been frequently confused, possibly due to previous subarachnoid hemorrhage or other factors, and is receiving haloperidol for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and previous admissions for subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute change in mental status.
- The patient presented with acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and was found to have a traumatic tracheal tear, which has been addressed with tracheostomy placement.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is likely a combination of obstructive sleep apnea, carbon dioxide retention, and pulmonary edema.
- She also has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension, requiring medication adjustments.
- The patient's altered mental status has improved but still exhibits confusion. Further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology.
- Other concerns include hypernatremia, potential aspiration risk, and uncontrolled type II diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory issues are likely a combination of OSA, CO2 retention, and mild pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilation management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Tracheal Tear: The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear that required tracheostomy placement. It is crucial to ensure proper healing of the tracheal tear and monitor for any signs of complications such as"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss, hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient was admitted with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage, readmitted to the MICU with acute change in mental status, and now readmitted with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), possibly obstructive-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and possibly an element of central respiratory failure. The patient's tracheal tear, presumed to have occurred during intubation, needs to be managed carefully.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia of unclear etiology, with atelectasis/failure/PE on differential. Diuresis has been initiated, and further investigations such as a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) may be required.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is better controlled today, but close monitoring is necessary. Enalapril and a beta-blocker will be continued, and prn hydralazine may be used. A negative fluid balance of 500cc-1L is desired.
4. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient's DM requires ongoing management, including SSRI administration.
5. Fever: The patient had a fever that resolved, which could be related to the tracheal tear post tracheal placement.
6. Mental status: The patient's mental status is alert and interactive but intermittently confused. Haloperidol may be considered for managing agitation, and sedation weaning should be pursued.

These are some of the potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information. It is important to closely monitor and manage these conditions to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, tracheobronchial disease, anemia, and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever since admission and has shown no improvement. Vital signs indicate hypotension with fluctuating blood pressures, tachycardia, and an elevated heart rate. Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube, and the patient is ventilated in assist-control mode with a tidal volume set at 350 mL. Oxygen delivery is maintained at 80% FiO2 to maintain SpO2 at 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 509 mL since 12 AM. Laboratory results reveal elevated WBC count, hemoglobin levels within normal range, slightly elevated platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within the range of 122-169 mg/dL. The patient's condition remains stable but requires close monitoring and management of vital signs and fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The persistent fever and elevated WBC count may suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure and the use of vasopressors indicate ongoing efforts to maintain adequate blood pressure. Hypotension can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk"

   [**Last Name (STitle) 5967**]
s note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   62 yr old female with PMH of afib, TIA, memory loss s/p hypoglycemic
   coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, GERD, asthma recently admitted
   with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage [**Date range (1) 5700**] and readmitted
   to MICU with acute change in mental status [**Date range (1) 5858**]. She is now MICU
   day 9 for acute hypercarbic respiratory failure due to tracheal tear
   requiring tracheostomy.
   Yesterday was put on PSV and tolerated it for three hours before
   desaturating to mid 80s requiring to be put back on ventilator. This AM
   had agitation treated with haldol. Currently alert, talkative, Tm
   100.4, stable vitals, A/C 350 x 16, peep 10, 80% with sats of 99%.
   Lungs clear ant/lat. 2+ LE edema bilat, R>L. FiO2 being weaned down.
   Etiology of acute hypoxia is unclear but likely related to
   atelectasis/derecruitment. Also possibilities are change in positioning
   of trach with failure to ventilate transiently, acute CHF, or mucus
   plugging. Doubt acute PE but reasonable to look for LE DVT given her
   immobility
 recent CTA without PE. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated
   since admission (there are no old films) and needs to be evaluated for
   diaphragm paresis.
   Otherwise, had afib with RVR requiring lopressor. Now back in NSR.
   Patient is being screened for LTAC. Will remain in MICU. Full Code.
   Patient is critically ill. Time 35 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage and readmitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a tracheal tear. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal tear: The patient has a tracheal tear, which occurred during intubation. This has resulted in acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The tracheostomy tube bypasses the injured area and will need 6-8 weeks to heal. Empiric antibiotic coverage, including antifungal coverage, has been started for 10 days.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia etiology is unclear. It could be due to atelectasis/failure, change in positioning of the trach with failure to ventilate transiently, acute congestive heart failure, or mucus plugging. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is better controlled today, and enalapril, beta-blockers, and PRN hydralazine will continue to be used to manage hypertension. Lasix"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was initially admitted with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage and later readmitted to the MICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to a tracheal tear.

The patient has been experiencing acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), possibly obstructive hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and possibly an element of central respiratory depression. She also has a tracheal tear, presumably occurring during intubation at the start of her prior admission. The tear has been managed by placing a tracheostomy tube to bypass the injured area, which will need 6-8 weeks to heal. Empiric antibiotic coverage including anti-fungal coverage has been initiated for 10 days.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxemia, with an unclear etiology. Atelectasis or ventilator failure are lower on the differential as she responded to being placed back on the ventilator. Diuretics will be started to address this issue, and oxygen requirement will be followed up on. If there is no improvement, a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) will be considered to rule out pulmonary"

She was admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and subsequently readmitted with acute change in mental status, acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, and a traumatic tracheal tear for which she underwent tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation and has failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). She has hypercarbic respiratory failure due to central apnea, mechanical deficits with a paralyzed right hemidiaphragm, and mild pulmonary edema. There is also hypoxia, which may be caused by atelectasis or fluid overload. A lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) did not show deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The respiratory issues are likely a combination of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), carbon dioxide retention, and complications from her hospital course including right lung collapse and mainstem intubation. The plan includes another pressure support trial, goal input/output (I/O) of 1 liter negative today with Lasix drip, continuation of Flovent, albuterol, and atrovent, and LENI negative for DVT.
2. Hematocrit drop:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage and later readmitted with acute mental status changes. The patient has a history of acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, traumatic tracheal tear, right lung collapse, and right mainstem intubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has failed spontaneous breathing trials.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation and has failed spontaneous breathing trials. She appears to have a combination of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), carbon dioxide retention, and right lung collapse. The goal is to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Tracheal Tear: The patient has a traumatic tracheal tear, which has been repaired through fiberoptic intubation and subsequent tracheostomy. She will be monitored closely for any complications related to the surgical site or airway management.

3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has central apnea contributing to her hypercarbic respiratory failure. This may require further evaluation and management, such as non-invasive ventilation or adjustments in sedation.

4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to atelectasis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss after hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was readmitted with acute change in mental status and found to have a traumatic tracheal tear, which was subsequently repaired.

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), carbon dioxide retention, and her hospital course, which has been complicated by right lung collapse and mainstem intubation. She remains on mechanical ventilation and has failed spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). Her hypoxia may be due to atelectasis or fluid overload, although pulmonary embolism (PE) is in the differential diagnosis but improves with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 24% to 20%, but all other cell lines are slightly down as well. She has been hemodynamically stable with no reports of bleeding, leading to suspicion of dilutional anemia. A repeat complete blood count (CBC) is planned, and if persistent, guaiac testing of stools and transfusion for Hct <21 will be considered.

The patient underwent tracheostomy and is"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage and readmitted to the MICU with acute change in mental status. She is now readmitted with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to a tracheal tear.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, tracheal tear, hypoxemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and mental status changes.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may worsen if not properly managed. This can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, acidosis, and further deterioration of mental status.

2. Tracheal Tear: The tracheal tear occurred during intubation and will require several weeks to heal. There is a risk of infection at the site of the tear, especially since the patient is on empiric antibiotic coverage including antifungal medication.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, which can be due to atelectasis or ventilation/perfusion mismatch. If not addressed, this can lead to further respiratory compromise and decreased oxygenation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, TIA, memory loss after hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, GERD, and asthma. The patient was admitted with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage, readmitted to MICU with acute change in mental status, and then readmitted again with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to tracheal tear and paralyzed right hemidiaphragm.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), possibly obstructive hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and element central. Weaning off the ventilator as tolerated and changing to pressure support mode is planned.

2. Tracheal tear: The tear presumably occurred during intubation at the start of the prior admission. A tracheostomy tube will be in place to bypass the injured area, which will need 6-8 weeks to heal. Empiric antibiotic coverage including antifungal coverage for 10 days is recommended.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient may experience hypoxemia due to atelectasis or ventilator-associated failure since she is back to her baseline. Diuresis will be initiated to address this issue.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss, hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted previously with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage and readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with acute change in mental status. She was readmitted again with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to tracheal tear and paralyzed right hemidiaphragm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), or an element of central respiratory failure. It is planned to wean off the ventilator as tolerated and change to pressure support (PS) mode.
2. Tracheal Tear: The tracheal tear occurred during intubation at the start of the prior admission. A tracheostomy tube is in place to bypass the injured area, which will need 6-8 weeks to heal. Empiric antibiotic coverage including antifungal coverage for 10 days is being provided.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, which is suspected to be due to atelectasis or ventilator failure. Diuretics will be used to address this"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was recently admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and readmitted for acute changes in mental status and acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a traumatic tracheal tear, which has been repaired.

The patient remains on mechanical ventilation and has failed a spontaneous breathing trial. She appears to have a combination of obstructive sleep apnea, carbon dioxide retention, and hospital-acquired complications such as right lung collapse and mainstem intubation. The respiratory issues may be due to central apnea, CO2 retention, and the patient's hospital course. Another pressure support trial is planned, along with continued use of inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids.

Her hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 24% to 20%, but other cell lines are slightly down as well. She is hemodynamically stable, and no reports of bleeding have been observed. A repeat complete blood count is ordered, and if persistent, guaiac testing of stools and transfusion for HCT<21 will be considered.

The patient underwent tracheostomy and is expected to have an 8-week recovery period to allow the tracheal tear to heal. Trache"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), asthma, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) readmitted with acute change in mental status. She has been diagnosed with several conditions, including fever (hypothermia), tracheobronchial disease, anemia, hypertension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and type II diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by right lung collapse, right mainstem intubation, and a traumatic tracheal tear, for which she underwent fiberoptic intubation and tracheostomy. She remains on mechanical ventilation and has failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Her respiratory issues are likely a combination of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CO2 retention, and her hospital course complications.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 24% to 20%, but all other cell lines are slightly down as well. She has been hemodynamically stable with no reports of bleeding. The cause is suspected to be dilutional, and a repeat complete blood count (CBC) is planned. If persistent, a guaiac test on stools will be performed, and transfusion will"

   62 yo F PMH of afib, TIA, memory loss s/p hypoglycemic coma, chronic
   low back pain, anemia, GERD, asthma recently admitted with
   subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage [**Date range (1) 5700**] and readmitted to
   MICU with acute change in mental status  [**Date range (1) 5858**] readmitted with
   acute hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary.  Found to have a
   tracheal tear and paralyzed right HD.  She is status post trach this
   admission.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC Central and paralyzed right HD
   -Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure - likely OSA, ?OHS,
   ?element central
   -wean vent as tolerated failing SBT would try to optimize her volume
   status and trial of PS sitting up.
   -Continue diuresis until BUN/Cr bump
   -Would consider giving diamox to help with contraction and to spill
   retained bicarb to help her breath.
Tracheal tear
   -presumably occurred during intubation at start of prior admission
   -IP following
   -trach in place to bypass injured area will need 6-8 weeks to heal
   -empiric abx coverage inc anti-fungal coverage 10 days of coverage
 hypoxemia
   -suspect atelectasis/failure/hypoventilation given she is back to her
   baseline.
   -Will diuresis
 ? Hilar fullness on CT-Repeat CT when stable withing next months.
   -Placed in discharge summary
 HYPERTENSION
     -cont  enalapril to 30mg qday
     -Continue Beta blocker
    -Cont hydralazine to 25mg qid
    -Will start lasix with goal negative fluid balance 500cc-1L negative.
   Will also help with BP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and tracheal tear. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack (TIA), memory loss following a hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and asthma.

The patient was admitted with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage and readmitted to the MICU with acute change in mental status. Upon further evaluation, the patient was found to have acute hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to tracheal tear and paralyzed right hemidiaphragm. The tracheal tear is presumed to have occurred during intubation at the start of the prior admission.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been placed on a tracheostomy tube to bypass the injured area, which will need 6-8 weeks to heal. Empiric antibiotic coverage including anti-fungal coverage has been initiated for 10 days. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/39-170/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, anemia, tracheobronchial disease, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition. The patient has been receiving various medications including Motrin (ibuprofen), heparin sodium, and lansoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/47 to 170/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat any infections promptly.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and performing regular bronchoscopic evaluations are necessary to detect and manage any potential VAP.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, memory loss following hypoglycemic coma, chronic low back pain, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. She was admitted to the MICU due to acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, tracheal tear, and paralysis of the right hand. 

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, tracheal tear, hypoxemia, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and intermittent fever. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Tracheal tear: The tracheal tear may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of infection and potential need for surgical intervention.
3. Hypoxemia: If the patient's hypoxemia persists or worsens, it can lead to tissue damage and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart attack.
5. Type II diabetes mellitus: Poor glycemic control can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
6. Intermittent fever: The underlying cause of the"
