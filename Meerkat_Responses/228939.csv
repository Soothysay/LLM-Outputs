","The patient is a 36-year-old female who presented with a chief complaint of a fall, subdural hematoma (SDH), and a fibular fracture. The patient was splinted for the fibular fracture and had a repeat head CT that showed stability. The plan is to confirm the stability of the SDH this morning. The patient has no known drug allergies.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's maximum temperature was 37.1 degrees Celsius (98.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with a current temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius (97.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The patient's heart rate ranged from 76 to 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranged from 64 to 112/39 to 49 mmHg, respiratory rate was between 14 and 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The patient's rhythm was sinus rhythm.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for nausea and vomiting. The flow sheet data shows that the patient received a total of 1,600 mL of intravenous fluids, with an output of 1,795 mL, including 650 mL of blood products. The patient also had urine output of 1,370 mL and received 450 mL of oral fluids. 

On physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with decreased breath sounds at the left base and dullness to percussion. The patient's abdomen was soft, and there was swelling of the right"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is a fall resulting in a subdural hematoma (SDH) and a fibular fracture. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently stable with controlled vital signs. However, there are several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has new oxygen requirements, a left lower lobe infiltrate, and unexplained syncope. These symptoms raise the possibility of a PE, which can be confirmed with a computed tomography angiography (CTA).

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The new LLL infiltrate could be due to aspiration, especially considering the patient's underlying emphysema. This would require further evaluation and appropriate management.

3. Cardiac event: The patient's fall may have been caused by a cardiac event such as syncope or arrhythmia. Further workup is needed to determine the exact cause.

4. Rib fracture and pulmonary contusion: The patient complains of rib pain, which could indicate an occult rib fracture. Additionally, there is a concern for pulmonary contusion or hemothorax, especially given the decreased breath sounds at the left base.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is receiving prophylaxis with boots, it is important to monitor for signs and symptoms of DVT, particularly given the immobility and risk factors present.

   Total time spent:
","The patient presents with a history of a fall, resulting in a subdural hemorrhage (SDH), fibular fracture, and possible substance abuse. They have been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of their condition.

Key findings and assessments include:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are stable.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and has been hemodynamically stable.
- Review of systems: The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath.
- Physical examination: The patient appears stable, but further evaluation is needed due to the presence of new lung infiltrates and possible pulmonary embolism.
- Lab results: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, hemoglobin level is low, platelet count is within normal range, creatinine level is normal, and troponin T levels are below the cutoff.
- Imaging: The patient's head CT scan shows no significant changes in the SDH, but new lung infiltrates are observed.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is a fall resulting in a subdural hemorrhage (SDH), fibular fracture, and nausea/vomiting. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events.

The vital signs show a stable temperature, slightly elevated heart rate within normal range, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's height is recorded as 67 inches, with total input of fluids being 1,600 mL (including 475 mL of IV fluids) and output of fluids being 1,795 mL (including 650 mL of blood products). Urine output is noted at 1,370 mL, with negative fluid balance of -195 mL.

Laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, creatinine level, and troponin-T level. Other lab values include elevated levels of CK (creatinine kinase), CKMB (creatine kinase-MB), and Troponin-T (503/10/<0.01). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

Assessment and plan include monitoring for fracture, nausea/vomiting, subdural hemorrhage, fall (syncope versus substance abuse), new oxygen requirement, left lower lobe infiltrate, possible pulmonary embolism, hypertension, and ethanol withdrawal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female admitted to the ICU for conservative management of an epidural hematoma following a fall. She also has a displaced right fibula fracture and is receiving medical treatment for nausea/vomiting, hypoxia, hypertension, cardiovascular concerns, alcohol use, tremors, anxiety, and gout. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 118/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal creatinine levels. Imaging revealed a small pulmonary embolism and a left lung effusion. The patient's current plan includes close monitoring, neuro checks every four hours, and holding certain medications such as aspirin, primidone, and indomethacin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a concern for PE due to the left lower lobe effusion seen on imaging. This can lead to further hypoxia and respiratory distress if not addressed appropriately.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to an aspiration event, which could potentially lead to pneumonia if not managed properly.
3. Gout flare: The patient has a history of gout, and certain medications ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female admitted after a fall, with a diagnosis of an epidural hematoma and a questionable syncopal event. The patient has a displaced right fibula fracture, for which ortho consultation has been made and a posterior splint has been placed. The patient's mental status is stable, and they are currently being treated conservatively. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 118/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,600 mL, with 741 mL given through IV fluids. The patient's weight remains unchanged from admission at 78.7 kg. The patient's lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Troponin-T levels are below detection limits, and glucose levels are within normal range. Imaging shows a concern for small pulmonary embolism (PE) with a left lower lobe effusion. The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing conservative management of the epidural hematoma, investigation into the fall with a possible syncopal event, and monitoring for potential pulmonary embolism. The patient's medications include lorazepam for sedation and various other medications for nausea, anxiety, and blood pressure control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's imaging indicates a concern for small PE, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is important to monitor the patient closely for signs of worsening respiratory distress or hypoxia.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia may represent an aspiration event. Close monitoring for symptoms of pneumonia, such as fever or increased respiratory distress, is necessary.
3. Fall-related Injuries: The patient's displaced right fibula fracture indicates a significant fall-related injury. Regular assessment of the fracture's healing progress and potential complications is required.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's murmur raises suspicion for aortic stenosis (AS), and further evaluation by a cardiologist is recommended. Monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia or other cardiac complications is essential.
5. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of an epidural hematoma, monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or worsening mental status, is crucial.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall with an epidural hematoma and a questionable syncopal event. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/45 to 138/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of atrial systolic murmur and is being followed by a cardiologist for possible aortic stenosis (AS). She denies any history of syncope, dyspnea, or exertional angina. The patient also reports consuming two glasses of wine the previous night and has barbiturates on her toxicology screen likely from primidone.

There is concern for a pulmonary embolism (PE) due to new oxygen requirement, possible syncopal episode, and the finding of a left lower lobe effusion on chest X-ray. However, cardiac enzymes are negative, ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as the cause of the fall. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was performed, which came back negative for PE.

The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivered through a nasal cannula. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.31, indicating respiratory acidosis.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1936**], a 74-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU after a fall with an epidural hematoma and a questionable syncopal event. She has a history of a murmur consistent with AS, which is being followed by a cardiologist. She denies any history of syncope, dyspnea, or exertional angina. The patient reports having had 2 glasses of wine last night, and her tox screen showed barbituates likely from primidone. There is concern for a possible PE due to new O2 requirement and possible syncopal episode, as well as CXR findings of LLL effusion. Cardiac enzymes are negative, ruling out ACS. A CTA was negative for PE. An echo has been ordered.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/45 mmHg to 138/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. Her weight is 78.7 kg, height is 67 inches, and she has received a total of 1,921 mL of fluids since 12 AM. The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, and electrolytes are also within normal limits."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly female with a chief complaint of subdural hemorrhage (SDH) and hypoxemia. The patient's history of present illness, allergies, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the events noted below. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/38 to 138/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no abnormalities on cardiovascular examination but decreased breath sounds on the left base and right foot swelling. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and troponin T level, with normal hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolyte levels. The patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. FRACTURE, OTHER - No specific treatment mentioned.
2. NAUSEA / VOMITING - No specific treatment mentioned.
3. SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH) - Radiographically stable, outpatient follow-up recommended.
4. FALL: syncope versus polysubstance - Unclear cause, no specific treatment mentioned.
5. PACs (possibly atrial fibrillation) - New O2 requirement, left lower lobe infiltrate, could be aspiration or contralateral pneumonitis"

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a subdural hematoma (SDH), hypoxemia, and other medical complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have shown fluctuation in blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their SpO2 levels are maintained at 96%. The physical examination reveals an altered mental status. The lab results show normal white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and creatinine levels. However, there is an elevated troponin T level, indicating potential cardiac damage. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient has a history of a fall, with syncope or polysubstance involvement. They also exhibit symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and unexplained syncope. There is suspicion of a pulmonary embolism (PE) due to new oxygen requirements, lung infiltrate, and unexplained syncope. The patient has a history of hypertension, alcohol use, and falls. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subdural Hematoma (SDH): The patient's SDH appears radiographically stable, but ongoing neurosurgical involvement is required. If the SDH worsens or leads to increased intracranial pressure, it can cause further brain damage or even death.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms, including new oxygen requirements, lung infiltrate, and unexplained syncope, raise concern"

 no events on telemetry. Still
   unclear if cardiac neuro or mechical event. Ongoing workup but pe
   raised as a new possibility today
   New O2 requirement
 looks like she has underlying emphysema but new
   LLL infiltrate
 could be aspiration (though contralat) but also worry
   about PE given new O2 req new eff and O2 requirement and unexplained
