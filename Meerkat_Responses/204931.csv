","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with ulcerative colitis who was recently admitted to the ICU. She presented with epistaxis (nosebleed) and is currently experiencing hypoxia. The patient is unresponsive to verbal commands and does not withdraw to painful stimuli, indicating encephalopathy. She has a history of allergies to medications, specifically unknown drug allergies. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antihistamines, bronchodilators, and antipsychotics.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin with warm, paper-thin skin and multiple ecchymoses. Vital signs show low body temperature, elevated heart rate, stable blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 97% with respiratory support.

Lab results indicate anemia with a low hemoglobin level, elevated white blood cell count, and low platelet count. Kidney function appears to be normal, but liver function may be slightly impaired. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The combination of low oxygen levels, elevated white blood cell count, and systemic symptoms may indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Bleeding disorders: The patient's history of epistaxis and low platelet count suggest a potential bleeding disorder or coagulopathy.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's unresponsiveness to verbal commands and lack of withdrawal to painful"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis who was admitted to the ICU with epistaxis, shock, ARF, and altered mental status. She has been transferred back to the hospital unit for recurrent epistaxis. The patient's current condition includes epistaxis with unclear etiology, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure improving to baseline, schizoaffective disorder with altered mental status, hypertension, anemia, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding from epistaxis: The patient has recurrent epistaxis with the source appearing to be the left middle turbinate. She has been packed by ENT and is currently stable. However, there is a risk of further bleeding, especially if the source cannot be controlled or if coagulation issues arise.
2. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient still has leukocytosis and a history of infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count.
3. Renal function: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which is slowly resolving. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to ensure proper fluid balance and electrolyte management.
4. Mental status changes: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to her schizoaffective disorder or other factors such as hypernatremia or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis who was initially admitted to the ICU with shock, acute renal failure (ARF), and altered mental status. She has now been transferred back to the ICU for epistaxis, which is believed to be caused by the left middle turbinate. The source of bleeding is currently being managed with packing by ENT. The patient's hemoglobin levels are stable, and she is being monitored every 12 hours for changes in hematocrit (Hct). Peripheral access or a central line will be obtained for further management.

The patient's acute renal failure is slowly resolving, and renal function is being closely monitored. She continues to receive calcium acetate and sodium bicarbonate. Her altered mental status appears to be at baseline and is expected to improve as delirium secondary to shock resolves. Risperidone will be restarted when she is able to take oral medications.

Other medical conditions include RUE swelling/erythema/blistering, which is improving with an ace bandage, and hypertension, for which metoprolol has been changed to IV prn. The patient also has a history of schizoaffective disorder, hyperglycemia, anemia, and osteomyelitis of the right hand. These conditions are being managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding from the epistaxis despite packing.
2. Worsening of acute renal failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis. She was initially admitted with shock, acute renal failure (ARF), and altered mental status. The patient has been transferred back to the ICU for epistaxis, which is believed to be caused by the left middle turbinate and has been treated with packing.

The patient's current medical complications include hypovolemia, epistaxis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, right lower extremity swelling/erythema/blistering, hypertension, schizoaffective disorder, hyperglycemia, anemia, and possible hypothyroidism.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Hypovolemia: The patient's low blood volume may lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels is crucial.
2. Epistaxis: Continued bleeding from the nasal packing could result in significant blood loss and further decrease in blood volume. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and coagulation status is essential.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further deterioration. This includes avoiding nephrotoxic medications and maintaining adequate fluid balance.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status should be assessed regularly to detect any changes in consciousness or cognition. Monitoring vital signs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis. She was initially admitted with shock, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has now been transferred back to the hospital unit for epistaxis (nosebleed). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.

2. Hypovolemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss due to the nosebleed and has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. Continuous monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary to ensure adequate volume status.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is currently compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of treatment accordingly are essential.

4. Thyroid dysfunction: The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have increased, indicating a possible sick thyroid or underlying thyroid dysfunction. Further evaluation and management are required.

5. Infection: The patient has been started on antibiotics due to suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Cultures are pending, and it is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection.

24-Hour Events:
- The patient was evaluated in the morning and was okay for a ground diet with thin liquids; however, nursing concern due to the patient coughing with liquids followed by oxygen desaturation. The patient was thus made NPO (nothing by mouth) again.
- The patient was subsequently put on a facial mask with inability to liberate from high-flow oxygen, and a chest X-ray showed no new areas of aspiration.
- The plan for angiography and embolization on [**1-27**] was made, though unable to find a guardian for consent during the day, social work is working on this issue.
- The patient received IV fluids with bicarb for prehydration for angiography.

   to agree to procedures, ICU team + social work looking into court
   appointed guardianship at this time.
   - ENT and neurosurg to take patient for angiography/embolization.
   Appreciate recs, asked ENT and neurosurgery to communicate with each
   other regarding emergent nature of procedure (if emergent, can be done
   without consent). Pt likely stable enough at this point to undergo
   embolization (Hct stable).
   - monitor q12 Hct, transfuse<25, active T&C
   - cont Zosyn and Vanco for HCAP (Ancef off for now)
   - If patient bleeds, spray Afrin to nasal packing/nose and apply
   pressure by pinching nose 15 min. If it does not stop, page ENT

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis. She was initially admitted with shock, acute renal failure (ARF), and altered mental status. The patient was transferred back to the ICU for epistaxis. She is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and is experiencing an inability to take medications without coughing, leading to oxygen desaturation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108-168 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on high-flow oxygen and has been prescribed various medications, including Heparin Sodium, Haloperidol, Metoprolol, Risperidone, and others. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, platelet count, and creatinine levels. The patient's sodium bicarbonate and potassium levels are low, while her calcium and phosphate levels are within normal range. The patient's most recent ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis. The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, diminished breath sounds in the right lower lobe, and absent pulses in both lower extremities. She has ecchymoses on her skin. The patient's neurologic examination is incomplete due to her altered mental status. The patient is currently on nasal packing for epistaxis and is scheduled for angi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of Ulcerative Colitis initially admitted with shock, ARF, and altered mental status. She is now back in the ICU for epistaxis. The patient has several medical complications including hypovolemia, epistaxis, pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypertension, altered mental status, RUE swelling/erythema/blistering, schizoaffective disorder, hyperglycemia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemia: The patient has been transfused with PRBCs and her Hct is stable, indicating that her blood volume is being maintained. However, there is a risk of further blood loss if the epistaxis is not controlled.
2. Epistaxis: The patient has a nosebleed likely from the middle turbinate. If not controlled, it can lead to significant blood loss and worsen the hypovolemia.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed infection in the right middle lobe of the lung. If left untreated, it can progress and lead to sepsis or respiratory failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is stable but needs close monitoring. Any further deterioration in renal function can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high despite being on metoprolol. If not controlled, it can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis, initially admitted with shock, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. She is now back in the ICU for epistaxis (nosebleed). The patient has several medical conditions, including hypertension, acute renal failure, altered mental status, epistaxis, schizoaffective disorder, hyperglycemia, and anemia. She is currently on multiple medications and has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and blood transfusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is at risk for aspiration due to her inability to protect her airway. She is also at risk for hypovolemia and further bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Hemorrhagic shock: The ongoing bleeding from the epistaxis can cause significant blood loss and lead to hypovolemic shock.
3. Acute renal failure exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing acute renal failure may worsen due to decreased renal perfusion from blood loss and hypovolemia.
4. Infection: The patient is on prolonged antibiotic therapy, which increases the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridium difficile infection.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, inability to protect airway, and hypovolemia. The patient underwent embolization without further epistaxis and received NS 250cc bolus x2 for decreased UOP. The patient is extubated without complication and is currently on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/61 mmHg to 178/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and various other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is at risk for respiratory complications due to the inability to protect airway and being on mechanical ventilation. Potential complications include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as ""altered"" rather than delirium, there is still a risk for delirium in the ICU setting, especially with the patient being on multiple medications and having a history of altered mental status.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immob"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis initially admitted with shock, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient was transferred back to the hospital unit for epistaxis (nosebleed). 

During this admission, the patient received embolization without further epistaxis and extubation without complication. The patient also received normal saline (NS) 250cc bolus three times for decreased urine output (UOP).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 36.7°C (98°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) at 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate (HR) at 65 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) at 119/61 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show the following values: white blood cell count (WBC) at 25.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.3 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) at 24.0%, platelet count (Plt) at 348 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.8 mg/dL, glucose at 126 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) at 135 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 3.6 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 104 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) at 8.7 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 1.5 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4) at 3.7 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination shows well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and anxious behavior. The cardiovascular examination reveals normal first and second heart sounds with no murmurs. The respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds. The abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The extremities show trace edema without cyanosis. The neurologic examination indicates attentive behavior, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, purposeful movement, and normal tone.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status (not delirium), airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), hypovolemia (volume depletion - without shock), and epistaxis (nosebleed). The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), metoprolol (hypertension), calcium acetate (acute renal failure), sodium bicarbonate (altered mental status), risperidone (schizoaffective disorder), and insulin sliding scale (hyperglyc"

   - If patient bleeds, spray Afrin to nasal packing/nose and apply
   pressure by pinching nose 15 min. If it does not stop, page ENT
   consult.
   - humidification via mask- Nasal cannula is contraindicated for this pt
   -INR 1.7 today- SC Vit K x1 ordered for today
   -needs Bicarb 75CC/hr and IV NAC prior to procedure- not currently
   awake enough for adequate PO
   Pneumonia- RML on cxr. HCAP versus aspiration of OP contents/blood.
   -Cont Vanco and Zosyn for now (day [**5-6**])- needs ID approval for Vanco
   - will need Vanc trough prior to 4th dose (in AM of [**1-31**]).
   - attempt to obtain sputum for speciation (induced versus expectorated,
   depending on what can be obtained for pt cooperation)
   - aspiration precautions and maintenance fluids for now (passed S&S but
   unable to take meds w/o cough).
   Hypertension: metoprolol to 10 mg IV q6H with holding parameters
   Acute Renal Failure:  Stable likely this is baseline today 2.7

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a chief complaint of epistaxis and respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation and underwent successful embolization for her nosebleed. The patient was extubated without difficulty but required reintubation due to respiratory failure. She has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently on hemodialysis. The patient also has a urinary tract infection and is receiving antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/53 to 178/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 50%. Her arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 105 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 28 mEq/L, and base excess of -3.6 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar rhonchi, soft abdomen, and 3+ edema in the arms and legs. Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a chief complaint of epistaxis and respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving invasive ventilation. The patient underwent successful embolization for her nosebleed and was extubated without difficulty. She has a history of altered mental status, inability to protect her airway, hypovolemia, and acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure, combined with her chronic renal failure, puts her at high risk for further respiratory complications.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics for a hospital-acquired pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing other infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
5. Malnutrition: The patient is unable to take oral nutrition at the moment, so there is a risk of malnutrition if total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is not properly managed.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure can worsen if not properly managed.
7. Bleeding: Although the patient has been stabilized after embolization for"
