   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including
   DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p cardiac arrest, likely VF in setting of AED
   shocks x2. Concern for antero-lateral NSTEMI given ST depressions in
   V2-V6 and TWI in I and aVL. She is s/p cardiac catherization at OSH
   which shows severe 3VD including critical left main disease. Patient
   with negative troponins at OSH, but positive troponins noted in setting
   of ACS vs. troponin leak from AED shocks. Patient would benefit from
   Arctic Sun protocol given recent VF arrest, stable hemodynamics, and
   current GCS scale of 9 (< 10). Relative contra-indications include
   active GIB, but per discussion with post arrest team, pt can be
   re-warmed if bleeding worsened. Head CT negative for acute ICH.
   Patient received full dose ASA yesterday.  Arctic sun was initiated
   after 9h, and was stopped after 2.5h due to bradycardia and torsade de
   pointes.
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus
   - will give aspirin 81mg, high dose statin, plavix and low dose BB
   (metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]) once pt is able to take PO meds from GIB stand
   point.
   - rewarm patient
   .
   # VF Arrest:  It appears that the first episode of VF arrest in the
   nursing home was related to ischemia.  However, the later VF arrest in
   OSH ED and the 4 episodes of VF overnight last night were due to
   re-perfusion given normalization of EKG, and no evidence of troponin
   elevation.  Pt loaded with lidocaine, on lidocaine gtt.  She also
   received 4gm magnesium.
   - continue lidocaine gtt, decrease to 1mg/min
   - cardioversion if pt goes back to VF and if she continues to be full
   code
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - telemetry
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient noted to have generalized seizure
   activity upon arrival to CCU. No acute bleed on Head CT. [**Month (only) 8**] be in
   setting of hypoxia after the 1st VF arrest.  Patient was loaded with
   dilantin. Patient was initiated on Arctic sun cooling protocol 9h after
   the second episode of cardiac arrest at OSH.  Patient developed
   bradycardia, QTc prolongation and VF, s/p cardioversion x3, arctic sun
   was therefore stopped.
   - d/c all sedating meds, including versed and phentanyl
   - f/u on final CT head read
   - need EEG to further assess neuro function
   - f/u neuro recs
   - IV ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # GI bleed: Likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation received
   (heparin, ASA, plavix, integrillin). Patient on ASA at home, but no
   history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently hemodynamically
   stable and receiving 2 U PRBCs. Guiac positive. Received 2u pRBC
   overnight.  Hct bumped appropriately from 31.8 to 37.2.  GI decided not
   to perform upper endoscopy given VF episodes.
   - active T&S
   - continue IV protonix gtt
   - has 2 PIVs and central line access
   - Hct checks [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u GI recs on when pt can start to take PO meds
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was initially hypertensive after being admitted
   to CCU.  After initiation of Arctic Sun, patient has been bradycardic
   and hypotensive.  Arctic sun stopped after 2.5h, and patient is being
   rewarmed.  Medication effects are also playing a role, including nitro
   gtt which was discontinued, sedating medications including versed and
   phentanyl also lead to hypotension. GIB likely also plays a role.  NS
   bolus did not help significantly, so patient was put on dopamine gtt
   early this morning.
   - d/c versed and phentanyl
   - down-titrate dopamine as tolerated
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   - GIB management as above
   .
   # PUMP:  unknown EF. Patient appears likely hypovolemic on exam in
   setting of recent UGIB.
   - TTE to assess for EF.
   .
   #  HLD:
   - f/u fasting lipid panel
   - continue high dose statin once taking PO meds
   .
   #  Diabetes Mellitus II:
   - hold metformin, continue ISS
   - f/u  HgA1c
   .
   #  Schizophrenia
   - continue risperdal once taking PO meds
   .
   # Dementia:
   - continue Namenda once taking PO meds
   .
   # PVD: s/p AAA repair
   - continue statin once taking PO meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was transferred from another hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been diagnosed with severe three-vessel disease including critical left main coronary artery disease. She received cardiac catheterization and is now in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-perfusion arrhythmias: The patient has had multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which may be due to re-perfusion following the cardiac catheterization.
2. Torsades de pointes: The patient experienced episodes of torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia that can occur during electrolyte imbalances or certain medications.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB): The patient had a significant UGIB likely due to anticoagulation therapy. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is currently stable.
4. Anoxic brain injury: The patient had a hypoxic event following the first VF arrest, leading to generalized seizure activity and potential anoxic brain injury.
5. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing bradycardia and hypotension, possibly due to medication effects, active gastrointestinal bleed, or the Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
6. Prolonged QT interval: The patient developed QTc prolongation, which can"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including
   DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p cardiac arrest, likely VF in setting of AED
   shocks x2. Concern for antero-lateral NSTEMI given ST depressions in
   V2-V6 and TWI in I and aVL. She is s/p cardiac catherization at OSH
   which shows severe 3VD including critical left main disease. Patient
   with negative troponins at OSH, but positive troponins noted in setting
   of ACS vs. troponin leak from AED shocks. Patient would benefit from
   Arctic Sun protocol given recent VF arrest, stable hemodynamics, and
   current GCS scale of 9 (< 10). Relative contra-indications include
   active GIB, but per discussion with post arrest team, pt can be
   re-warmed if bleeding worsened. Head CT negative for acute ICH.
   Patient received full dose ASA yesterday.  Arctic sun was initiated
   after 9h, and was stopped after 2.5h due to bradycardia and torsade de
   pointes.
   - Continue aspirin, at 81mg daily given GIB
   - high dose statin
   - low dose beta-blocker (metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **])
   - rewarm patient
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus
   .
   # Rhythm / Torsade de pointes / Bradycardia:  Patient was initiated on
   Arctic sun cooling protocol 9h after the second episode of cardiac
   arrest at OSH.  Patient developed bradycardia, QTc prolongation and
   torsade de pointes which deteriorated to VF, s/p cardioversion x3.  Pt
   loaded with lidocaine, on lidocaine gtt.  She also received 4gm
   magnesium.
   - continue lidocaine gtt
   - Mg bolus if pt goes back to torsade de pointes
   - cardioversion if pt goes back to torsade de pointes and if she
   continues to be full code
   - replete K > 4 Mg > 2
   - telemetry
   .
   # GI bleed: Likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation received
   (heparin, ASA, plavix, integrillin). Patient on ASA at home, but no
   history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently hemodynamically
   stable and receiving 2 U PRBCs. Guiac positive. Received 2u pRBC
   overnight.  Hct bumped appropriately from 31.8 to 37.2.  GI decided not
   to perform upper endoscopy given torsade de pointes.
   - active T&S
   - IV protonix gtt
   - has 2 PIVs and central line access
   - Hct checks [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue heparin gtt and aspirin given stable hct
   - f/u GI recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was initially hypertensive after being admitted
   to CCU.  After initiation of Arctic Sun, patient has been bradycardic
   and hypotensive.  Arctic sun stopped after 2.5h, and patient is being
   rewarmed.  Medication effects are also playing a role, including nitro
   gtt which was discontinued, lidocaine gtt also leads to hypotension.
   GIB likely also plays a role.
   - NS bolus prn
   - start dopamine gtt if BP non-responsive to NS boluses
   - continue lidocaine gtt with the understanding that it would drop BP
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr
   - goal CVP 10cm
   - GIB management as above
   .
   # PUMP:  unknown EF. Patient appears likely hypovolemic on exam in
   setting of recent UGIB.
   - TTE to assess for EF.
   .
   # Seizure: Patient noted to have generalized seizure activity upon
   arrival to CCU. No acute bleed on Head CT. [**Month (only) 8**] be in setting of hypoxia
   s/p VF arrest.  Patient was loaded with dilantin.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Torsades de pointes: The patient experienced multiple episodes of torsades de pointes, which is a type of ventricular tachycardia that can lead to cardiac arrest. The patient received cardioversion and was loaded with magnesium to address this condition.

2. Bradycardia: The patient developed bradycardia while undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (Arctic Sun protocol), which may be a contraindication for the procedure. Bradycardia can compromise cardiac output and lead to hypoperfusion.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient is suspected to have an active UGIB, likely due to anticoagulation therapy. This condition can result in significant blood loss and hypotension, requiring blood transfusions and supportive measures.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with initial hypertension followed by hypotension after initiating the Arctic Sun protocol. Hypotension can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and organ dysfunction.

5. Seizure activity: The patient experienced generalized seizure activity upon arrival to the ICU. Seizures can be caused by various factors, including hypoxia or an underlying neurological condition.

6. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient had a cardiac arrest"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was transferred from another hospital after experiencing a cardiac arrest, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been diagnosed with severe triple vessel disease (3VD) including critical left main disease, negative troponins at the previous hospital, but positive troponins in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus troponin leak from defibrillator shocks. She received full-dose aspirin yesterday. The patient was initiated on an Arctic Sun cooling protocol but developed bradycardia, QTc prolongation, and torsade de pointes which deteriorated to ventricular fibrillation (VF), requiring cardioversion. She was loaded with lidocaine and received 4gm magnesium. The patient also has a femoral arterial line, right radial arterial line, and multi-lumen central venous catheter in place. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 150/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of severe 3VD and critical left main disease, indicating significant coronary artery disease. She experienced VF arrest twice, which may indicate ongoing ischemia or reperfusion injury. There is"

   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including
   DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p cardiac arrest, likely VF in setting of AED
   shocks x2. Concern for antero-lateral NSTEMI given ST depressions in
   V2-V6 and TWI in I and aVL. She is s/p cardiac catherization at OSH
   which shows severe 3VD including critical left main disease. Patient
   with negative troponins at OSH, but positive troponins noted in setting
   of ACS vs. troponin leak from AED shocks. Patient would benefit from
   Arctic Sun protocol given recent VF arrest, stable hemodynamics, and
   current GCS scale of 9 (< 10). Relative contra-indications include
   active GIB, but per discussion with post arrest team, pt can be
   re-warmed if bleeding worsened. Head CT negative for acute ICH.
   Patient received full dose ASA yesterday.  Arctic sun was initiated
   after 9h, and was stopped after 2.5h due to bradycardia and torsade de
   pointes.
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus
   - will give aspirin 81mg, high dose statin, plavix and low dose BB
   (metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]) once pt is able to take PO meds from GIB stand
   point.
   - rewarm patient
   .
   # VF Arrest:  It appears that the first episode of VF arrest in the
   nursing home was related to ischemia.  However, the later VF arrest in
   OSH ED and the 4 episodes of VF overnight last night were due to
   re-perfusion given normalization of EKG, and no evidence of troponin
   elevation.  Pt loaded with lidocaine, on lidocaine gtt.  She also
   received 4gm magnesium.
   - continue lidocaine gtt, decrease to 1mg/min
   - cardioversion if pt goes back to VF and if she continues to be full
   code
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - telemetry
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient noted to have generalized seizure
   activity upon arrival to CCU. No acute bleed on Head CT. [**Month (only) 8**] be in
   setting of hypoxia after the 1st VF arrest.  Patient was loaded with
   dilantin. Patient was initiated on Arctic sun cooling protocol 9h after
   the second episode of cardiac arrest at OSH.  Patient developed
   bradycardia, QTc prolongation and VF, s/p cardioversion x3, arctic sun
   was therefore stopped.
   - d/c all sedating meds, including versed and phentanyl
   - f/u on final CT head read
   - need EEG to further assess neuro function
   - f/u neuro recs
   - IV ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # GI bleed: Likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation received
   (heparin, ASA, plavix, integrillin). Patient on ASA at home, but no
   history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently hemodynamically
   stable and receiving 2 U PRBCs. Guiac positive. Received 2u pRBC
   overnight.  Hct bumped appropriately from 31.8 to 37.2.  GI decided not
   to perform upper endoscopy given VF episodes.
   - active T&S
   - continue IV protonix gtt
   - has 2 PIVs and central line access
   - Hct checks [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u GI recs on when pt can start to take PO meds
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was initially hypertensive after being admitted
   to CCU.  After initiation of Arctic Sun, patient has been bradycardic
   and hypotensive.  Arctic sun stopped after 2.5h, and patient is being
   rewarmed.  Medication effects are also playing a role, including nitro
   gtt which was discontinued, sedating medications including versed and
   phentanyl also lead to hypotension. GIB likely also plays a role.  NS
   bolus did not help significantly, so patient was put on dopamine gtt
   early this morning.
   - d/c versed and phentanyl
   - down-titrate dopamine as tolerated
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   - GIB management as above
   .
   # PUMP:  unknown EF. Patient appears likely hypovolemic on exam in
   setting of recent UGIB.
   - TTE to assess for EF.
   .
   #  HLD:
   - f/u fasting lipid panel
   - continue high dose statin once taking PO meds
   .
   #  Diabetes Mellitus II:
   - hold metformin, continue ISS
   - f/u  HgA1c
   .
   #  Schizophrenia
   - continue risperdal once taking PO meds
   .
   # Dementia:
   - continue Namenda once taking PO meds
   .
   # PVD: s/p AAA repair
   - continue statin once taking PO meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including coronary ischemia, anoxic brain injury, fever, leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleed, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has positive troponins indicating cardiac injury, and her brain CT scan shows chronic microvascular ischemic changes. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains unresponsive to voice and noxious stimuli. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary ischemia: The patient has severe three-vessel disease, including critical left main disease. She has had a cardiac arrest and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation. There is a possibility of recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's brain CT scan demonstrates bilateral atherosclerotic disease of carotids with possible ulceration vs small dissection at the origin of the left internal carotid, fenestration at the anterior communicating artery with small aneurysmatic formation, chronic microvascular ischemic changes, and bilateral sinus disease. She is at risk for further neurological deterioration and may require ongoing neurologic monitoring and support.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has had a fever and leukocyt"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and subsequent generalized seizure activity. 

The patient's current assessment includes severe three-vessel coronary artery disease with critical left main disease, negative troponins, and normalized EKG after cardioversion. She is on continuous telemetry and lidocaine infusion for arrhythmia prophylaxis. 

The patient also has an anoxic brain injury, as indicated by a computed tomography angiography (CTA) head showing bilateral atherosclerotic disease of carotids with possible ulceration vs small dissection at the origin of the left internal carotid. There is also a fenestration at the anterior communicating artery with a small aneurysmatic formation (2 mm), chronic microvascular ischemic changes, and bilateral sinus disease. 

Additionally, the patient has a gastrointestinal bleed, for which she received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently hemodynamically stable. She is on IV protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has an order for active tissue and serum testing. 

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with previous episodes of hypotension and now hypertension. She was on dopamine infusion but has been weaned off and is now hypertensive. 

Other assessments include pump dysfunction,"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including
   DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p cardiac arrest, likely VF in setting of AED
   shocks x2. Concern for antero-lateral NSTEMI given ST depressions in
   V2-V6 and TWI in I and aVL. She is s/p cardiac catherization at OSH
   which shows severe 3VD including critical left main disease. Patient
   with negative troponins at OSH, but positive troponins noted in setting
   of ACS vs. troponin leak from AED shocks. Patient would benefit from
   Arctic Sun protocol given recent VF arrest, stable hemodynamics, and
   current GCS scale of 9 (< 10). Relative contra-indications include
   active GIB, but per discussion with post arrest team, pt can be
   re-warmed if bleeding worsened. Head CT negative for acute ICH.
   Patient received full dose ASA yesterday.  Arctic sun was initiated
   after 9h, and was stopped after 2.5h due to bradycardia and torsade de
   pointes.
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus
   - will give aspirin 81mg, high dose statin, plavix and low dose BB
   (metoprolol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]) once pt is able to take PO meds from GIB stand
   point.
   - rewarm patient
   .
   # VF Arrest:  It appears that the first episode of VF arrest in the
   nursing home was related to ischemia.  However, the later VF arrest in
   OSH ED and the 4 episodes of VF overnight last night were due to
   re-perfusion given normalization of EKG, and no evidence of troponin
   elevation.  Pt loaded with lidocaine, on lidocaine gtt.  She also
   received 4gm magnesium.
   - continue lidocaine gtt, decrease to 1mg/min
   - cardioversion if pt goes back to VF and if she continues to be full
   code
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - telemetry
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient noted to have generalized seizure
   activity upon arrival to CCU. No acute bleed on Head CT. [**Month (only) 8**] be in
   setting of hypoxia after the 1st VF arrest.  Patient was loaded with
   dilantin. Patient was initiated on Arctic sun cooling protocol 9h after
   the second episode of cardiac arrest at OSH.  Patient developed
   bradycardia, QTc prolongation and VF, s/p cardioversion x3, arctic sun
   was therefore stopped.
   - d/c all sedating meds, including versed and phentanyl
   - f/u on final CT head read
   - need EEG to further assess neuro function
   - f/u neuro recs
   - IV ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # GI bleed: Likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation received
   (heparin, ASA, plavix, integrillin). Patient on ASA at home, but no
   history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently hemodynamically
   stable and receiving 2 U PRBCs. Guiac positive. Received 2u pRBC
   overnight.  Hct bumped appropriately from 31.8 to 37.2.  GI decided not
   to perform upper endoscopy given VF episodes.
   - active T&S
   - continue IV protonix gtt
   - has 2 PIVs and central line access
   - Hct checks [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u GI recs on when pt can start to take PO meds
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient was initially hypertensive after being admitted
   to CCU.  After initiation of Arctic Sun, patient has been bradycardic
   and hypotensive.  Arctic sun stopped after 2.5h, and patient is being
   rewarmed.  Medication effects are also playing a role, including nitro
   gtt which was discontinued, sedating medications including versed and
   phentanyl also lead to hypotension. GIB likely also plays a role.  NS
   bolus did not help significantly, so patient was put on dopamine gtt
   early this morning.
   - d/c versed and phentanyl
   - down-titrate dopamine as tolerated
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   - GIB management as above
   .
   # PUMP:  No h/o of prior EF, but
   - TTE to assess for EF.
   .
   #  HLD: Total Cholesterol 102, TG 98, HDL 34, Chol/HD 3.0, LDL <50.
   - NPO, but resume Lipitor 20mg qHS once taking PO meds
   .
   #  Diabetes Mellitus II: HgbA1c 13.0%. Holding home Metformin.
   - Increased ISS for improved coverage
   .
   #  Schizophrenia:
   - NPO, but resume home Risperdal 4mg qAM & 6mg q8PM once taking PO meds
   .
   # Dementia:
   - NPO, but resume Namenda 10mg [**Hospital1 **] once taking PO meds
   .
   # PVD: s/p AAA repair
   - NPO, but resume home Lipitor 20mg qHS when taking PO meds

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly obese woman who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. She remains unresponsive to voice and noxious stimuli, with only pupillary constriction observed. The patient has a history of bilateral atherosclerotic disease of the carotids, a small aneurysmatic formation at the anterior communicating artery, chronic microvascular ischemic changes, and bilateral sinus disease. Fever was noted at 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit in the evening. Her vital signs include a temperature of 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure within normal range, heart rate within normal range, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including lidocaine, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,758 mL and output of 1,303 mL, with a negative balance of 3,455 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and contaminated urine analysis indicate a potential infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment may be necessary.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly obese woman who experienced a cardiac arrest and was admitted to the ICU. She has been intubated and is currently unresponsive. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), blood pressure of 124/54 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's neurologic function is limited, with only pupillary constriction and cough response observed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological impairment: The patient's current unresponsive state and limited neurologic function indicate a potential risk of ongoing neurological impairment or potential for further deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and contaminated urine analysis suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not properly managed.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal (GI"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition is critical, with multiple medical complications. 

From the note, the following potential medical complications can be identified:
1. GI issues: The patient has not had an immediate plan for endoscopy, indicating a possible gastrointestinal problem.
2. Neurological deficits: The patient's only demonstrable neurologic function is some pupillary constriction and cough, suggesting potential neurological impairment.
3. Carotid artery disease: The CTA head revealed bilateral atherosclerotic disease of the carotids with possible ulceration vs small dissection at the origin of the left internal carotid. This indicates compromised blood flow to the brain.
4. Aneurysmatic formation: There is a small aneurysmatic formation (2 mm) at the anterior communicating artery. This could potentially lead to an aneurysm rupture.
5. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes: These changes are indicative of reduced blood flow to the brain over time, potentially causing long-term neurological damage.
6. Bilateral sinus disease: This suggests issues with the sinuses, which may be contributing to the patient's overall condition.
7. Fever: The patient had a fever of 102.8 at 8:30 pm, indicating an infection or inflammation in the body.
8. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and central"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: Patient with multiple risk factors
   for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p VF arrest & cardioversion.
   EKG initially concerning for NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization at OSH
   demonstrated severe 3VD including critical left main disease, but
   patient with negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after
   cardioversion suggesting auto-clearance of coronary occlusion. Patient
   was unable to tolerate Artic Sun protocol (terminated after 2.5 hours)
   given bradycardia, hypotension.  Now, patient with positive troponins
   after AED shocks. Head CT negative for ICH.  Patient without further
   episodes of arrythmia over the past 24 hours on Lidocaine gtt.
   - Continue Lidocaine gtt at 1mg/min
   - Continue Heparin gtt for now, d/c after 48 hours ([**12-30**] @ 5AM)
   - Defibrillate if pt goes into VF
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Plan for Aspirin 81mg, Lipitor, Plavix and Metoprolol once pt is able
   to take PO meds (GI bleed).
   .
   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy: Patient noted to have generalized
   seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates 1.
   Bilateral atherosclerotic disease of carotids with possible ulceration
   vs small dissection at the origin of the left internal carotid. 2.
   Fenestration at the anterior communicating artery with small
   aneurysmatic formation (2 mm) 3. Chronic microvascular ischemic
   changes. 4. Bilateral sinus disease, but no ICH. Neurology felt that
   the seizure may have been in the setting of hypoxia after VF arrest.
   She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**]. Artic Sun was initiated, but
   terminated early as patient was unable to tolerate. This AM, patient
   opening her eyes to voice. Babinski
s remain upgoing bilaterally.
   - 24 hr EEG ordered to further assess neurologic function
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - IV Ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - Seizure precautions
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Patient admitted with WBC of 14, spiked fever to
   102.8 on [**12-28**] PM, resolved with Tylenol. [**Month (only) 8**] be reactive to cardiac
   arrest and trauma from resuscitation, but degree of fever significant.
   Given proximity of intubation and hospitalization, unlikely to be
   HAP/VAP and a repeat CXR was clear. All line sites appear clean and
   without erythema or drainage this AM, but patient had A-line in her
   groin placed at OSH, that has subsequently been pulled, that could be
   possible nidus. Blood cultures, U/A, urine cultures, sputum cultures
   sent. U/A c/w contaminant, will repeat this AM. Sputum gram stain
   demonstrates 4+ gram negative diplococci, 2+ gram positive cocci in
   pairs & clusters, 1+ gram negative rods, 1+ gram positive rods. No
   diarrhea. WBC trending down this AM to 12.8.
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U repeat U/A
   - F/U blood, urine, sputum cx
   - If patient develops diarrhea, can send C. diff
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient s/p 2u pRBC
s on [**12-28**] for likely UGIB in setting of
   anticoagulation (Heparin gtt, ASA, Plavix, Integrillin). Patient on ASA
   at home, but no history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently
   hemodynamically stable with slowly drifting Hct
s. Hct stable o/n at
   31.0. NG output bloody-appearing. Guaiac positive. GI held off on upper
   endoscopy yesterday and given relative stability, no urgent need for
   endoscopy, but can revisit if patient drops Hct significantly.
   - Active T&S, R-IJ & two PIV
   - Continue IV Pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct checks TID
   - f/u GI recs re: endoscopy & PO medications
   - Continue Heparin gtt until [**12-30**] AM unless patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable.
   - Transfuse for Hct goal >30
   .
   #  Hypertension: Patient previously hypotensive in the setting of Artic
   Sun, Nitro gtt, and sedation, now weaned from Dopamine gtt overnight,
   and hypertensive with sbp
s in the 180-190
s. Hypertension may be
   partially owed to fluids received overnight for low CVP and low-normal
   urine output. While patient is noted to have h/o HTN, her baseline BP
   are unknown and she takes no antihypertensives as an outpatient. She
   received 5mg IV Labetalol x 2 with sbp
s to the 160
s. Neuro confirmed
   this as an appropriate antihypertensive regimen.
   - Continue IV Labetalol if hypertension progresses
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   .
   #  PUMP:  No baseline EF. No current evidence of heart failure.
   Valvular function unknown. Given clinical presentation, will defer TTE
   for now, but can reconsider if functional status improves.
   .
   #  HLD: Total Cholesterol 102, TG 98, HDL 34, Chol/HD 3.0, LDL <50.
   - NPO, but resume Lipitor 20mg qHS once taking PO meds
   .
   #  Diabetes Mellitus II: HgbA1c 13.0%. Holding home Metformin.
   - Increased ISS for improved coverage
   .
   #  Schizophrenia:
   - NPO, but resume home Risperdal 4mg qAM & 6mg q8PM once taking PO meds
   .
   # Dementia:
   - NPO, but resume Namenda 10mg [**Hospital1 **] once taking PO meds
   .
   # PVD: s/p AAA repair
   - NPO, but resume home Lipitor 20mg qHS when taking PO meds

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Coronary ischemia: The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation, which suggests possible coronary ischemia. However, her troponin levels were negative initially but became positive later on, indicating a possible coronary occlusion.

2. Anoxic brain encephalopathy: The patient had a generalized seizure upon arrival to the CCU, which may have been related to hypoxia following the cardiac arrest. The CT angiography (CTA) of the head showed bilateral atherosclerotic disease of the carotids, a small dissection at the origin of the left internal carotid, fenestration at the anterior communicating artery with a small aneurysmatic formation, chronic microvascular ischemic changes, and bilateral sinus disease. These findings suggest possible brain injury due to lack of oxygen (anoxic brain encephalopathy).

3. GI bleed: The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for likely upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in the setting of anticoagulation therapy. The NG output was bloody-appearing, and the guaiac test was positive. Although the upper endoscopy was held off initially, it may be necessary if"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: Patient with multiple risk factors
   for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p VF arrest & cardioversion.
   EKG initially concerning for NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization at OSH
   demonstrated severe 3VD including critical left main disease, but
   patient with negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after
   cardioversion suggesting auto-clearance of coronary occlusion. Patient
   was unable to tolerate Artic Sun protocol (terminated after 2.5 hours)
   given bradycardia, hypotension.  Now, patient with positive troponins
   after AED shocks. Head CT negative for ICH.  Patient without further
   episodes of arrythmia over the past 24 hours on Lidocaine gtt.
   - Continue Lidocaine gtt at 1mg/min
   - Continue Heparin gtt for now, d/c after 48 hours ([**12-30**] @ 5AM)
   - Defibrillate if pt goes into VF
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Plan for Aspirin 81mg, Lipitor, Plavix and Metoprolol once pt is able
   to take PO meds (GI bleed).
   .
   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy: Patient noted to have generalized
   seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates 1.
   Bilateral atherosclerotic disease of carotids with possible ulceration
   vs small dissection at the origin of the left internal carotid. 2.
   Fenestration at the anterior communicating artery with small
   aneurysmatic formation (2 mm) 3. Chronic microvascular ischemic
   changes. 4. Bilateral sinus disease, but no ICH. Neurology felt that
   the seizure may have been in the setting of hypoxia after VF arrest.
   She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**]. Artic Sun was initiated, but
   terminated early as patient was unable to tolerate. This AM, patient
   opening her eyes to voice. Babinski
s remain upgoing bilaterally.
   - 24 hr EEG ordered to further assess neurologic function
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - IV Ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - Seizure precautions
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Patient admitted with WBC of 14, spiked fever to
   102.8 on [**12-28**] PM, resolved with Tylenol. [**Month (only) 8**] be reactive to cardiac
   arrest and trauma from resuscitation, but degree of fever significant.
   Given proximity of intubation and hospitalization, unlikely to be
   HAP/VAP and a repeat CXR was clear. All line sites appear clean and
   without erythema or drainage this AM, but patient had A-line in her
   groin placed at OSH, that has subsequently been pulled, that could be
   possible nidus. Blood cultures, U/A, urine cultures, sputum cultures
   sent. U/A c/w contaminant, will repeat this AM. Sputum gram stain
   demonstrates 4+ gram negative diplococci, 2+ gram positive cocci in
   pairs & clusters, 1+ gram negative rods, 1+ gram positive rods. No
   diarrhea. WBC trending down this AM to 12.8.
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U repeat U/A
   - F/U blood, urine, sputum cx
   - If patient develops diarrhea, can send C. diff

   # GI bleed: Patient s/p 2u pRBC
s on [**12-28**] for likely UGIB in setting of
   anticoagulation (Heparin gtt, ASA, Plavix, Integrillin). Patient on ASA
   at home, but no history of GI bleeds in the past. Patient is currently
   hemodynamically stable with slowly drifting Hct
s. Hct stable o/n at
   31.0. NG output bloody-appearing. Guaiac positive. GI held off on upper
   endoscopy yesterday and given relative stability, no urgent need for
   endoscopy, but can revisit if patient drops Hct significantly.
   - Active T&S, R-IJ & two PIV
   - Continue IV Pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct checks TID
   - f/u GI recs re: endoscopy & PO medications
   - Continue Heparin gtt until [**12-30**] AM unless patient becomes
   hemodynamically unstable.
   - Transfuse for Hct goal >30
   .
   #  Hypertension: Patient previously hypotensive in the setting of Artic
   Sun, Nitro gtt, and sedation, now weaned from Dopamine gtt overnight,
   and hypertensive with sbp
s in the 180-190
s. Hypertension may be
   partially owed to fluids received overnight for low CVP and low-normal
   urine output. While patient is noted to have h/o HTN, her baseline BP
   are unknown and she takes no antihypertensives as an outpatient. She
   received 5mg IV Labetalol x 2 with sbp
s to the 160
s. Neuro confirmed
   this as an appropriate antihypertensive regimen.
   - Continue IV Labetalol if hypertension progresses
   - maintain goal MAP>60, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   .
   #  PUMP:  No baseline EF. No current evidence of heart failure.
   Valvular function unknown. Given clinical presentation, will defer TTE
   for now, but can reconsider if functional status improves.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and subsequent generalized seizure. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including severe three-vessel disease and critical left main coronary artery disease. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with controlled oxygen delivery. 

The patient's current medical issues include anoxic brain encephalopathy, fever with leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypertension. The CTA head showed bilateral atherosclerotic disease of the carotids with possible ulceration versus small dissection at the origin of the left internal carotid, fenestration at the anterior communicating artery with small aneurysmatic formation, chronic microvascular ischemic changes, and bilateral sinus disease. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 124/54 mmHg to 180-190 mmHg. Her heart rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is at 100%. However, she has an upgoing bilateral Babinski reflex, indicating potential neurologic impairment. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels. Her kidney function is within normal limits, but her liver enzymes are slightly elevated. 

Plan:
- Continue lidocaine infusion at 1 mg/min
- Continue heparin infusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was successfully resuscitated. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications since her admission, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding, generalized seizure activity, coronary ischemia, anoxic brain injury, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary ischemia: The patient has a history of multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She experienced a cardiac arrest and had severe three-vessel disease, including critical left main disease, as seen on cardiac catheterization. Although her troponin levels were negative initially and her EKG normalized after cardioversion, she now has positive troponins. This suggests ongoing myocardial injury or ischemia. Continuous monitoring and further evaluation are needed to assess the extent of coronary ischemia.

2. Anoxic brain injury: The patient experienced a generalized seizure upon arrival to the CCU, which may be related to hypoxia following the cardiac arrest. She was loaded with Dilantin, and the Arctic Sun cooling protocol was initiated but stopped due to bradycardia, QTc prolongation, and ventricular fibrillation. Further assessment of neurologic function through EEG and follow-up neurologic recommendations are necessary.

TTE ([**2177-12-29**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity si
ze is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
basal to mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets a
re mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgita
tion is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral r
egurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgi
tation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion. T
here is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Mild focal LV
systolic dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: Patient with multiple risk factors
   for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p VF arrest & cardioversion.
   EKG initially showed NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization at OSH
   demonstrated severe 3VD including critical left main disease, but
   patient with negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after
   initiation of medical therapy including aspirin, plavix, heparin, and
   integrillin, suggesting resolution of coronary occlusion. Patient was
   unable to tolerate Artic Sun protocol (terminated after 2.5 hours)
   given bradycardia, hypotension, and new VF arrests x4 s/p electrical
   cardioversion.   Patient without further episodes of arrythmia over the
   past 48 hours, off Amiodarone and lidocaine. Heparin gtt was
   discontinued early this AM.  She was on heparin gtt for approx. 48h.
   Code status was changed to
shock ok, no compression
   - d/c lidocaine gtt today
   - start pr aspirin today
   - Defibrillate if pt goes into VF
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Plan for Aspirin 81mg, Lipitor, Plavix and Metoprolol once pt is able
   to take PO meds (GI bleed).
   .
   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy: Patient noted to have generalized
   seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates no ICH.
   Neurology felt that the seizure may have been in the setting of hypoxia
   after VF arrest.  She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**]. Artic Sun was
   initiated, but terminated early as patient was unable to tolerate.
   Patient is slowly improving, currently following commands, indicating
   improving cortical function. Brainstem reflexes present.  EEG ordered,
   but couldn
t get it done yesterday.  Dilantin was loaded, but patient
   hasn
t received maintenance dose.
   - start dilantin 100mg TID, will check level tomorrow
   - 24 hr EEG will be done today to further assess neurologic function
   - f/u Neurology recs, currently
cautiously optimistic
   - IV Ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - follow serial neuro exams
   - Seizure precautions
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Patient admitted with WBC of 14, has been
   spiking fevers, receiving tylenol.  [**Month (only) 8**] be reactive to cardiac arrest
   and trauma from resuscitation. Given proximity of intubation and
   hospitalization, unlikely to be HAP/VAP and a repeat CXR was clear.
   Blood cultures, U/A, urine cultures, sputum cultures sent. U/A c/w
   contaminant. Sputum gram stain demonstrates 4+ gram negative
   diplococci, 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs & clusters, 1+ gram
   negative rods, 1+ gram positive rods. Blood culture from the central
   line grew out GPC in [**12-15**] bottles.  No abx was started given only
   bottles are positive with GPC. No diarrhea. WBC stable at 13.4 today.
   - f/u GPC speciation and sensitivities in blood cx, if MRSA, will start
   vanc
   - F/U remaining blood, urine, sputum cx
   - If patient develops diarrhea, can send C. diff
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient s/p 2u pRBC
s on [**12-28**] for likely UGIB in setting of
   anticoagulation (Heparin gtt, ASA, Plavix, Integrillin). This am, hct
   dropped from 30.5-27.6, was given another unit of pRBC.  Heparin gtt
   was discontinued. Patient on ASA at home, but no history of GI bleeds
   in the past. NG output continues to be bloody-appearing. Guaiac
   positive. GI held off on upper endoscopy and given relative stability,
   no urgent need for endoscopy, but can revisit if patient drops Hct
   significantly.
   - Active T&S, R-IJ & two PIV
   - Continue IV Pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct checks TID
   - f/u GI recs re: endoscopy & PO medications
   - Transfuse for Hct goal >30
   .
   #  Hypertension: Patient previously hypotensive in the setting of Artic
   Sun, Nitro gtt, and sedation, now has been hypertensive with sbp
s in
   the 180-190
s, requiring labetalol prn. Hypertension may be partially
   due to fluids received for low-normal urine output. While patient is
   noted to have h/o HTN, her baseline BP
s are unknown and she takes no
   antihypertensives as an outpatient. She received 5mg IV Labetalol x 2
   yesterday. Neuro confirmed this as an appropriate antihypertensive
   regimen, and goal.
   - Continue IV Labetalol if hypertension progresses
   - maintain goal sbp at 150-160, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   .
   #  PUMP:  TTE done on [**12-29**] showed EF of mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
   hypokinesis. EF 45-50%.  Patient appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   failure.
   - IVF prn for low UOP
   - will start BB and lisinopril once patient can take POs.
   .
   #  HLD: Total Cholesterol 102, TG 98, HDL 34, Chol/HD 3.0, LDL <50.
   - NPO, but resume Lipitor 20mg qHS once taking PO meds
   .
   #  Diabetes Mellitus II: HgbA1c 13.0%. Holding home Metformin.
   - continue HISS
   .
   #  Schizophrenia:
   - NPO, but resume home Risperdal 4mg qAM & 6mg q8PM once taking PO meds
   .
   # Dementia:
   - NPO, but resume Namenda 10mg [**Hospital1 **] once taking PO meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been receiving various medications, including aspirin, Plavix, heparin, and integrillin. She has had episodes of hypotension and bradycardia, requiring interventions such as electrical cardioversion and administration of lidocaine and amiodarone. The patient's blood cultures showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. She also has leukocytosis, fever, and bloody output from the nasogastric tube. The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped significantly, indicating potential blood loss, possibly due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, requiring labetalol to maintain a target systolic blood pressure of 150-160 mmHg. The patient's heart function is mildly compromised, with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation. She is euvolemic and showing signs of improvement, but remains on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her neurological condition is improving, but she still requires continuous EEG monitoring. The patient's lipid profile is within normal limits, and her diabetes is not well-controlled with a HbA1c level of 13.0%. She has a history of schizophrenia and dementia, for which she was taking risperidone and namenda, respectively. The patient's peripheral vascular disease is managed with Lipitor. She is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN)."

TTE ([**2177-12-29**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity si
ze is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
basal to mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets a
re mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgita
tion is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral r
egurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgi
tation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion. T
here is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Mild focal LV
systolic dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia
   transferred from OSH s/p cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed
   and generalized seizure activity.
   .
   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: Patient with multiple risk factors
   for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p VF arrest & cardioversion.
   EKG initially showed NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization at OSH
   demonstrated severe 3VD including critical left main disease, but
   patient with negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after
   initiation of medical therapy including aspirin, plavix, heparin, and
   integrillin, suggesting resolution of coronary occlusion. Patient was
   unable to tolerate Artic Sun protocol (terminated after 2.5 hours)
   given bradycardia, hypotension, and new VF arrests x4 s/p electrical
   cardioversion.   Patient without further episodes of arrythmia over the
   past 48 hours, off Amiodarone and lidocaine. Heparin gtt was
   discontinued early this AM.  She was on heparin gtt for approx. 48h.
   Code status was changed to
shock ok, no compression
   - d/c lidocaine gtt today
   - start pr aspirin today
   - Defibrillate if pt goes into VF
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Plan for Aspirin 81mg, Lipitor, Plavix and Metoprolol once pt is able
   to take PO meds (GI bleed).
   .
   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy: Patient noted to have generalized
   seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates no ICH.
   Neurology felt that the seizure may have been in the setting of hypoxia
   after VF arrest.  She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**]. Artic Sun was
   initiated, but terminated early as patient was unable to tolerate.
   Patient is slowly improving, currently following commands, indicating
   improving cortical function. Brainstem reflexes present.  EEG ordered,
   but couldn
t get it done yesterday.  Dilantin was loaded, but patient
   hasn
t received maintenance dose.
   - start dilantin 100mg TID, will check level tomorrow
   - 24 hr EEG will be done today to further assess neurologic function
   - f/u Neurology recs, currently
cautiously optimistic
   - IV Ativan 2 mg PRN: seizure activity
   - follow serial neuro exams
   - Seizure precautions
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Patient admitted with WBC of 14, has been
   spiking fevers, receiving tylenol.  [**Month (only) 8**] be reactive to cardiac arrest
   and trauma from resuscitation. Given proximity of intubation and
   hospitalization, unlikely to be HAP/VAP and a repeat CXR was clear.
   Blood cultures, U/A, urine cultures, sputum cultures sent. U/A c/w
   contaminant. Sputum gram stain demonstrates 4+ gram negative
   diplococci, 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs & clusters, 1+ gram
   negative rods, 1+ gram positive rods. Blood culture from the central
   line grew out GPC in [**12-15**] bottles.  No abx was started given only
   bottles are positive with GPC. No diarrhea. WBC stable at 13.4 today.
   - f/u GPC speciation and sensitivities in blood cx, if MRSA, will start
   vanc
   - F/U remaining blood, urine, sputum cx
   - If patient develops diarrhea, can send C. diff
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient s/p 2u pRBC
s on [**12-28**] for likely UGIB in setting of
   anticoagulation (Heparin gtt, ASA, Plavix, Integrillin). This am, hct
   dropped from 30.5-27.6, was given another unit of pRBC.  Heparin gtt
   was discontinued. Patient on ASA at home, but no history of GI bleeds
   in the past. NG output continues to be bloody-appearing. Guaiac
   positive. GI held off on upper endoscopy and given relative stability,
   no urgent need for endoscopy, but can revisit if patient drops Hct
   significantly.
   - Active T&S, R-IJ & two PIV
   - Continue IV Pantoprazole gtt
   - Hct checks TID
   - f/u GI recs re: endoscopy & PO medications
   - Transfuse for Hct goal >30
   .
   #  Hypertension: Patient previously hypotensive in the setting of Artic
   Sun, Nitro gtt, and sedation, now has been hypertensive with sbp
s in
   the 180-190
s, requiring labetalol prn. Hypertension may be partially
   due to fluids received for low-normal urine output. While patient is
   noted to have h/o HTN, her baseline BP
s are unknown and she takes no
   antihypertensives as an outpatient. She received 5mg IV Labetalol x 2
   yesterday. Neuro confirmed this as an appropriate antihypertensive
   regimen, and goal.
   - Continue IV Labetalol if hypertension progresses
   - maintain goal sbp at 150-160, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   .
   #  PUMP:  TTE done on [**12-29**] showed EF of mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
   hypokinesis. EF 45-50%.  Patient appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   failure.
   - IVF prn for low UOP
   - will start BB and lisinopril once patient can take POs.
   .
   #  HLD: Total Cholesterol 102, TG 98, HDL 34, Chol/HD 3.0, LDL <50.
   - NPO, but resume Lipitor 20mg qHS once taking PO meds
   .
   #  Diabetes Mellitus II: HgbA1c 13.0%. Holding home Metformin.
   - continue HISS
   .
   #  Schizophrenia:
   - NPO, but resume home Risperdal 4mg qAM & 6mg q8PM once taking PO meds
   .
   # Dementia:
   - NPO, but resume Namenda 10mg [**Hospital1 **] once taking PO meds
   .
   # PVD: s/p AAA repair
   - NPO, but resume home Lipitor 20mg qHS when taking PO meds

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary ischemia, severe 3VD (three-vessel disease), and critical left main disease. There is also mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. The patient's blood pressure is currently elevated, and the goal is to maintain systolic blood pressure at 150-160 mmHg. This may require ongoing management with antihypertensive medications.

2. Neurological complications: The patient has experienced anoxic brain encephalopathy after a cardiac arrest and generalized seizure activity. The patient's EEG has been ordered but not yet done. Dilation has been loaded, but the patient hasn't received the maintenance dose. The patient's neurologic function is improving, but there is a risk of further neurological deterioration.

3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, indicating a possible infection. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urinalysis have been sent, but no antibiotics have been started yet. There is a concern for gram-negative diplococci, which could indicate a bacterial infection. The patient's white blood cell count is stable at 13.4, and there is no evidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has experienced upper gastrointestinal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on various medications including aspirin, Plavix, heparin, and integrillin for coronary ischemia, Diltiazem for anoxic brain encephalopathy, and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 124/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on room air, and a sinus rhythm. Her weight has increased from 67 kg at admission to 71.4 kg currently.

The patient has shown improvement in her neurologic function, following commands and indicating improving cortical function. An EEG has been ordered to further assess her neurologic status. She is also being monitored for seizure activity and has been given IV Ativan as needed.

The patient's blood cultures have grown out gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which is consistent with Staphylococcus aureus. However, the sputum gram stain shows the presence of gram-negative diplococci, indicating"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including coronary ischemia, anoxic brain encephalopathy, fever with leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypertension. She also has a history of peripheral vascular disease and schizophrenia.

The patient's current vital signs show a stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Her temperature is slightly elevated at 38.1 degrees Celsius. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL and respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute. She is also receiving IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and IV labetalol for hypertension management.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and hematocrit levels. Blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. Imaging studies reveal mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild mitral regurgitation.

The patient's current plan includes continued monitoring of vital signs, neurological status, and serial neuro exams. She is being treated with IV ativan for seizure activity and scheduled for a 24-hour EEG to further assess her neurologic function. Blood cultures, urinal"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia transferred from OSH s/p
   cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed and generalized seizure
   activity.
   .
   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: Patient with multiple risk factors
   for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p VF arrest &
   defibrillation. EKG initially showed NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization
   at OSH demonstrated severe 3VD including critical left main disease,
   but patient with negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after
   initiation of medical therapy suggesting resolution of coronary
   occlusion. Patient without episodes of arrhythmia since the day of
   admission, now off Amiodarone, Lidocaine, and Heparin gtt. Code status
   was readdressed and HCP requesting that patient receive defibrillation
   or cardioversion as needed, but no chest compressions.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Continue PR Aspirin
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - Consider trial of PO meds today including Plavix as Hct bumped
   appropriately and oral secretions are significantly less in quantity
   and less bloody
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patient trialed on pressure support yesterday,
   but minute ventilation dropped, so placed back on AC. RSBI this AM 83.
   ABG appropriate. Will trial pressure support and if minute ventilation
   maintained, acknowledging patient
s known sleep apnea, can trial
   extubation.
   - Consider extubation if minute ventilation maintained and ABG
   demonstrate adequate oxygenation
   .
   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy: Patient noted to have generalized
   seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates no ICH.
   Neurology felt that the seizure may have been in the setting of hypoxia
   after VF arrest.  Patient
s cortical function slowly returning,
   currently able to follow simple commands, e.g. squeezing both hands,
   moving eyes. She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**] for seizure
   prophylaxis and a 24 hr EEG was started yesterday.  Maintenance
   Dilantin was not started until [**12-30**].  Expected serum Dilantin level
   correcting for elderly status & hypoalbuminemia is 9. Today
s level is
   4.7, so reloaded with Dilantin and continued maintenance dosing.
   - Continue Dilantin 100mg IV TID, will check level again tomorrow &
   titrate PRN
   - 24 hr EEG will be complete this morning, but preliminary results do
   not show seizure activity
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Seizure precautions, Ativan IV 2 mg PRN: seizures
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Patient admitted with WBC of 14, has been
   spiking fevers, receiving Tylenol. Urine cultures grew gram negative
   rods. Speciation pending. Sputum cultures grew Moraxella catarrhalis.
   Sensitivities pending. Repeat CXR
s clear. Started on IV Ceftriaxone. 1
   of 4 blood cultures from the central line grew out coag negative
   staph.  No diarrhea. WBC stable at 13.6 today.
   - As patient switching to PO
s & Moraxella likely to be chronic and not
   cause of pneurmonia, switch back to Bactrim DS PO BID x 7 days, day [**1-18**]
   - f/u Urine & sputum cx speciation/sensitivities
   - F/U remaining blood cx
   - If patient develops diarrhea, can send C. diff
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient s/p 4u pRBC
s on (2u on [**12-28**], 2u on [**12-30**]) for
   likely UGIB in setting of anticoagulation (Heparin gtt, ASA, Plavix,
   Integrillin). Heparin gtt held since [**12-30**] AM. Hct this AM 34.5. NG
   output far less bloody-appearing. Guaiac positive. GI has no immediate
   plan for endoscopy, but can revisit if patient drops Hct significantly.
   - Active T&S ([**12-30**]), R-IJ & two PIV
   - Continue Pantoprazole, switch to PO
   - Hct checks [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for Hct goal >30
   .
   #  Hypertension: Patient previously hypotensive in the setting of Artic
   Sun, Nitro gtt, and sedation, now has been hypertensive with sbp
s in
   the 180-190
s, requiring Labetalol PRN. While patient is noted to have
   h/o HTN, her baseline BP
s are unknown and she takes no
   antihypertensives as an outpatient.
   - Goal sbp
s at 150-160, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   - Labetalol 100mg PO BID, hold if sbp<160. If not adequate, can trial
   Hydralazine
   .
   #  PUMP:  TTE done on [**12-29**] showed EF of mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
   hypokinesis. EF 45-50%.  Patient appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   failure.
   - IVF PRN for low UOP
   - Begin Metoprolol  PO today

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia transferred from OSH s/p
   cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed and generalized seizure
   activity.
   .
   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: Patient with multiple risk factors
   for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p VF arrest &
   defibrillation. EKG initially showed NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization
   at OSH demonstrated severe 3VD including critical left main disease,
   but patient with negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after
   initiation of medical therapy suggesting resolution of coronary
   occlusion. Patient without episodes of arrhythmia since the day of
   admission, now off Amiodarone, Lidocaine, and Heparin gtt. Code status
   was readdressed and HCP requesting that patient receive defibrillation
   or cardioversion as needed, but no chest compressions.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Continue PR Aspirin
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   - Consider trial of PO meds today including Plavix as Hct bumped
   appropriately and oral secretions are significantly less in quantity
   and less bloody
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patient trialed on pressure support yesterday,
   but minute ventilation dropped, so placed back on AC. RSBI this AM 83.
   ABG appropriate. Will trial pressure support and if minute ventilation
   maintained, acknowledging patient
s known sleep apnea, can trial
   extubation.
   - Consider extubation if minute ventilation maintained and ABG
   demonstrate adequate oxygenation
   .
   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy: Patient noted to have generalized
   seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates no ICH.
   Neurology felt that the seizure may have been in the setting of hypoxia
   after VF arrest.  Patient
s cortical function slowly returning,
   currently able to follow simple commands, e.g. squeezing both hands,
   moving eyes. She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**] for seizure
   prophylaxis and a 24 hr EEG was started yesterday.  Maintenance
   Dilantin was not started until [**12-30**].  Expected serum Dilantin level
   correcting for elderly status & hypoalbuminemia is 9. Today
s level is
   4.7, so reloaded with Dilantin and continued maintenance dosing.
   - Continue Dilantin 100mg IV TID, will check level again tomorrow &
   titrate PRN
   - 24 hr EEG will be complete this morning, but preliminary results do
   not show seizure activity
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Seizure precautions, Ativan IV 2 mg PRN: seizures

   # Fever, leukocytosis: Patient admitted with WBC of 14, has been
   spiking fevers, receiving Tylenol. Urine cultures grew gram negative
   rods. Speciation pending. Sputum cultures grew Moraxella catarrhalis.
   Sensitivities pending. Repeat CXR

   output far less bloody-appearing. Guaiac positive. GI has no immediate
   plan for endoscopy, but can revisit if patient drops Hct significantly.
   - Active T&S ([**12-30**]), R-IJ & two PIV
   - Continue Pantoprazole, switch to PO
   - Hct checks [**Hospital1 **]

   #  Hypertension: Patient previously hypotensive in the setting of Artic
   Sun, Nitro gtt, and sedation, now has been hypertensive with sbp
s in
   the 180-190
s, requiring Labetalol PRN. While patient is noted to have
   h/o HTN, her baseline BP
s are unknown and she takes no
   antihypertensives as an outpatient.
   - Goal sbp
s at 150-160, UOP >30cc/hr, goal CVP 10cm
   - Labetalol 100mg PO BID, hold if sbp<160. If not adequate, can trial

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, complicated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed and generalized seizure activity. The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease and showed signs of severe triple vessel disease on cardiac catheterization, but with negative troponins and normalized EKG, suggesting resolution of the coronary occlusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary ischemia: The patient's history of multiple risk factors for CAD and the initial presentation of NSTEMI indicate potential ongoing coronary ischemia.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has shown respiratory distress, which could be due to pneumonia or her known sleep apnea. Close monitoring and consideration for extubation if minute ventilation is maintained and ABG demonstrates adequate oxygenation.
3. Anoxic brain encephalopathy: The patient had a generalized seizure upon arrival to the CCU, which may have been related to hypoxia after the cardiac arrest. Neurological function is slowly returning, but she requires seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin.
4. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has been spiking fevers and has leukocytosis. Urine cultures grew gram-negative rods, and sputum cultures grew Moraxella catarrhalis. These findings suggest an infection that needs to be further investigated and treated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, heart disease, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and subsequent upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's condition has been complicated by generalized seizure activity, fever, leukocytosis, and a urinary tract infection.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary ischemia: The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, including diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. She experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest and was defibrillated. Initial EKG showed non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe three-vessel disease, including critical left main disease. However, the patient's troponin levels were negative, and the EKG normalized after initiation of medical therapy, suggesting resolution of the coronary occlusion. The patient is now off amiodarone, lidocaine, and heparin gtt. Code status was readdressed, and healthcare professionals request that the patient receive defibrillation or cardioversion as needed, but no chest compressions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, which was complicated by an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including anticonvulsant medication, antibiotics, and cardiac support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Coronary ischemia: The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She experienced a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which suggests possible coronary artery occlusion. Although the patient's troponin levels were negative at one point, and the EKG normalized after initiating medical therapy, there is still a concern for ongoing coronary ischemia.

2. Anoxic brain encephalopathy: The patient had a generalized seizure upon arrival to the CCU, which could be related to hypoxia following the VF arrest. The neurology team is monitoring her cortical function, and she is currently able to follow simple commands. A 24-hour EEG has been started, and maintenance Dilantin has been initiated for seizure prophylaxis.

3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has been spiking fevers and has a high white blood cell count (WBC). Urine cultures grew gram-negative rods, and sputum cultures grew Morax"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been extubated and is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. She also has anoxic brain encephalopathy, coronary ischemia with severe three-vessel disease, fever, leukocytosis, and a urinary tract infection. Her vital signs are stable, but she has episodes of apnea and requires oxygen supplementation. The patient is on various medications for seizure prophylaxis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and periods of apnea may lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and prn ABG are recommended.
2. Seizure recurrence: Although the patient is currently on seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin, there is still a risk of seizure recurrence due to her previous generalized seizure activity. Continuous EEG monitoring and seizure precautions should be continued.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and coronary ischemia increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous telemetry and repletion of potassium and magnesium levels are important for arrhythmia prevention.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, complicated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed and generalized seizure activity.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory distress: The patient was extubated yesterday, and her ABG looks good on the face mask. She has periods of apnea due to known sleep apnea. Oxygen should be weaned as needed, and respiratory status should be monitored along with prn ABG. Nebulizers with atrovent and albuterol should be administered as needed.
- Anoxic brain encephalopathy: The patient suffered from anoxic brain injury from VF arrest at the nursing home and is recovering nicely. She had a generalized seizure upon arrival to the CCU, but a CTA head demonstrated no intracranial hemorrhage. Neurology believes that the seizure may have been due to hypoxia after VF arrest. The patient's cortical function is slowly returning, and she is currently able to follow simple commands. She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**] for seizure prophylaxis and a 24-hour EEG was started yesterday. Maintenance Dilantin was not started until [**12-30**]. Since the Dilantin level was low at 4.7 yesterday, she was given another Dilantin load"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and generalized seizure activity. The patient had severe coronary artery disease, including critical left main disease, but showed resolution of the coronary occlusion with medical therapy. She was on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated yesterday.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has periods of apnea known as sleep apnea. Oxygen should be weaned as needed, and respiratory status should be monitored. ABG should be checked periodically, and nebs (atrovent and albuterol) should be given as needed.

2. Anoxic brain encephalopathy: The patient suffered from an anoxic brain injury during ventricular fibrillation arrest and is recovering nicely. She is currently able to follow simple commands and has cortical function slowly returning. A 24-hour EEG was started yesterday, and maintenance Dilantin was not started until 12/30. Dilantin level was low at 4.7 yesterday, so another Dilantin load of 700mg was given. Dilantin level should be followed up today, and the maintenance dose should be titrated PRN. A repeat EEG should be followed up, along with neurology recommendations, and serial neuro exams should be conducted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been extubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but required reintubation due to respiratory distress and periods of apnea related to known sleep apnea. The patient's neurological status has improved, with cortical function slowly returning and the ability to follow simple commands. A 24-hour EEG was started, and the patient is receiving maintenance Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially required invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress and periods of apnea. Close monitoring of respiratory status and frequent ABG analysis will be necessary.
2. Anoxic Brain Encephalopathy: The patient suffered from anoxic brain injury during the cardiac arrest. Continued neurological evaluation and monitoring are essential to assess ongoing recovery.
3. Coronary Ischemia: The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, including diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Further evaluation and management of coronary ischemia may be required.
4. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient had fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. Cultures were obtained, and appropriate antibiotic therapy was initiated. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest, complicated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed and generalized seizure activity. 

The patient has been extubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. Her ABG results are within normal limits on face mask. She has a history of known sleep apnea and requires monitoring of respiratory status and periodic ABG analysis. Nebulizations with atrovent and albuterol are administered as needed.

The patient suffered from anoxic brain encephalopathy due to ventricular fibrillation arrest, but her cortical function is slowly returning. She is able to follow simple commands, squeeze hands, and move eyes. She received a load of dilantin on 12/28 for seizure prophylaxis and maintenance dilantin was started on 12/30. Her dilantin level was low at 4.7 yesterday, so she was given another load of 700mg of dilantin yesterday. Dilantin levels will be followed up today, and the medication will be titrated as needed.

The patient also has coronary ischemia post ventricular fibrillation arrest. She demonstrated severe three-vessel disease including critical left main disease, but her troponins were negative at OSH and EKG normalized after initiation of medical therapy. The patient is currently off am"

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest, complicated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been in the ICU since December 27th.

Key points from the progress note include:
1. Neurological status: The patient is alert and oriented, with eyes open and tracking to voice. She is able to move eyes, blink on command, and squeeze hands bilaterally. Babinski reflex is down-going bilaterally. The patient suffered from anoxic brain injury from VF arrest but is recovering nicely with cortical function returning. She is currently able to follow commands.

2. Respiratory status: The patient was extubated on December 31st and is currently on 2L nasal cannula with good oxygenation. She has periods of apnea known as sleep apnea. She continues to require regular suction, aspiration precautions, and bactrim (day 3-18). Oxygen can be weaned as needed, and the patient should be monitored for respiratory status and prn ABG.

3. Cardiovascular status: The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia transferred from OSH s/p
   cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed and generalized seizure
   activity.
   .
   # Rhythm: patient was noted to have brief Afib and aflutter on tele
   this morning.  Resolved without intervention.
   - change labetalol to metoprolol 25mg TID, uptitrate as tolerated,
   target HR 60-80
   - continue to monitor on tele
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patient was extubated [**12-31**], ABG looks good on
   2L nasal cannula.   Patient has periods of apnea [**1-13**] known sleep
   apnea.
   - continue regular suction
   - aspiration precaution
   - continue bactrim (day [**3-18**])
   - if febrile, will pan culture
   - wean oxygen as needed
   - monitor respiratory status and prn ABG
   - atrovent and albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy:  Per her daughter, patient
s mental
   status is currently at her baseline.  Patient suffered from anoxic
   brain injury from VF arrest at nursing home, and is recovering nicely.
   Patient
s cortical function returning, currently able to follow
   commands, e.g. squeezing both hands, moving eyes. Patient noted to have
   generalized seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates
   no ICH. Neurology felt that the seizure may have been in the setting of
   hypoxia after VF arrest.  She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**] for
   seizure prophylaxis and started on maintenance dilantin on [**12-30**].  A 24
   hr EEG was done which showed temporal slowing and some spikes, but no
   seizure activity.  Per neurology, goal Dilantin level should be [**9-25**].
   Corrected Dilantin level is 11 today.
   - Continue Dilantin 100mg IV TID for 7days (day [**3-18**] today), will check
   level again tomorrow & titrate PRN
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Seizure precautions, Ativan IV 2 mg PRN: seizures
   .
   # Deconditioning:  Patient was extubated on [**12-31**], failed S/S eval on
   [**1-1**].  Currently very weak.
   - continue TF to regain strength
   - OT/PT
   .
   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: Patient with multiple risk factors
   for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p VF arrest &
   defibrillation. EKG initially showed NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization
   at OSH demonstrated severe 3VD including critical left main disease,
   but patient with negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after
   initiation of medical therapy suggesting resolution of coronary
   occlusion. Patient without episodes of arrhythmia since the day of
   admission, now off Amiodarone, Lidocaine, and Heparin gtt. Code status
   was readdressed and HCP requesting that patient receive defibrillation
   or cardioversion as needed, but no chest compressions.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - will need interventional cardiologist eval for balloon angio or Csurg
   re-evaluation for possible CABG for her severe left main disease once
   pt is more stable from resp and neuro stand point, possibly next week
   - Continuous telemetry
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: WBC up today to 14.7, but patient has been
   afebrile.  Urine cultures grew klebsiella pneumoniae. Sputum cultures
   grew Moraxella catarrhalis, sensitivities pending. Repeat CXR
s clear.
   Started on IV Ceftriaxone. 1 of 4 blood cultures from the central line
   grew out coag negative staph, likely contamination.  No diarrhea. As
   patient switched to PO
s & Moraxella likely to be chronic and not cause
   of pneurmonia, abx was switch back to Bactrim DS PO BID x 7 days.
   - continue bacterim, day [**3-18**]
   - f/u sputum cx speciation/sensitivities
   - F/U remaining blood cx
   - If patient develops diarrhea, can send C. diff
   - if patient febrile, will send more cultures
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient previously hypotensive in the setting of Artic
   Sun, Nitro gtt, and sedation, now has been hypertensive with sbp
s in
   the 180-190
s despite Labetalol and captopril.  Labetalol was increased
   from 100mg [**Hospital1 **] to 100mg TID.  Captopril was increased from 6.25mg TID
   to 12.5mg TID. BP better controlled after the above dose increases.
   - continue labetalol 100mg TID
   - continue captopril at 12.5mg TID
   .
   # GI bleed: Resolved.  Hct this morning 34.0. PO meds were started
   [**12-31**]. Patient s/p 4u pRBC
s on (2u on [**12-28**], 2u on [**12-30**]) for likely UGIB
   in setting of anticoagulation (Heparin gtt, ASA, Plavix, Integrillin).
   - Continue Lansoprazole Oral Disintegrating Tab 30 mg PO/NG DAILY
   - Hct check daily
   - Transfuse for Hct goal >30

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 77-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia.
- She was transferred to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest and subsequent upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient suffered from generalized seizure activity upon arrival but has been seizure-free since then.
- Neurological examinations have shown improvement, with the patient able to follow commands, move eyes, and squeeze hands.
- The patient's mental status is reported to be at her baseline, indicating recovery from anoxic brain encephalopathy.
- She has been extubated and is currently on a 2L nasal cannula for respiratory support. However, she experiences periods of apnea due to known sleep apnea.
- The patient has a history of coronary ischemia and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe three-vessel disease including critical left main disease. Although negative troponins were initially observed, the patient's EKG normalized after medical therapy.
- She is now off antiarrhythmic medications and anticoagulation therapy.
- The patient developed a fever and leukocytosis, leading to the identification of klebsiella pneumoniae in urine cultures and Moraxella catarrhalis in sputum cultures. She was treated with IV ceftriaxone and later switched to oral Bactrim DS for Morax"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and subsequent upper gastrointestinal bleed. She also had a generalized seizure upon arrival. The patient has been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen. She has been diagnosed with anoxic brain encephalopathy and is recovering well, with cortical function returning and the ability to follow commands. She was loaded with Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis but has a high corrected Dilantin level of 11. Her mental status is at baseline, and she is showing signs of deconditioning. She has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease and experienced ventricular fibrillation arrest. An EKG initially showed NSTEMI, but the coronary occlusion resolved with medical therapy. She has negative troponins and no episodes of arrhythmia since admission. She is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose statin therapy. She has fever and leukocytosis with positive cultures for klebsiella pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are likely contaminants. She has also been diagnosed with hypertension, which is not well-controlled despite medication. She had a gastrointestinal bleed that has resolved, and she has received packed red blood cell transfusions. She has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45-50"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest, complicated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed and generalized seizure activity. The patient has been extubated and is currently on a 2L nasal cannula for respiratory support. She has a history of coronary ischemia and was previously on amiodarone, lidocaine, and heparin. Her current medications include metoprolol, captopril, aspirin, Plavix, high-dose statin, lansoprazole, Lipitor, and risperdal. She also has a history of peripheral vascular disease and has undergone an AAA repair.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's history of respiratory distress and known sleep apnea may lead to periodic episodes of apnea. Continuous suctioning, aspiration precautions, and monitoring of respiratory status are recommended.
2. Deconditioning: The patient's weakness and failure of the S/S evaluation indicate deconditioning. Physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) recommendations suggest the need for high-level rehabilitation.
3. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is advised, along with the continuation of metoprolol and potential uptitration as tolerated to target a heart rate of 60-80 bpm. No need for anticoagulation at this time.
4. Anoxic brain encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is currently at her baseline, but she suffered from an anoxic brain injury during VF arrest. Neurological evaluation and serial neuro exams are recommended. Seizure precautions should be continued, and the goal Dilantin level should be maintained between 9-25 mcg/mL.
5. Coronary ischemia: The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD and a history of VF arrest. She requires ongoing cardiac monitoring, and further evaluation by an interventional cardiologist for balloon angioplasty or coronary surgery is needed due to severe left main disease.
6. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a WBC count of 14.9 and previously had fever. Urine cultures grew pansensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae, and sputum cultures grew Moraxella catarrhalis. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and repeat cultures should be obtained.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled with metoprolol and captopril. These medications should be continued.
8. GI bleed: The patient had a resolved upper GI bleed and received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Hct should be monitored daily, and further transfusion may be required to maintain a Hct goal of >30.
9. PUMP dysfunction: The patient has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 45-50%. Medications such as metoprolol and captopril should be continued.
10. HLD: The patient's lipid profile indicates hyperlipidemia. Lipitor 80mg daily should be continued.
11. Diabetes Mellitus II: The patient's HbA1c level is 13.0%, and home metformin is being held. Glycemic control should be monitored.

   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy:  Per her daughter, patient
s mental
   status is currently at her baseline.  Patient suffered from anoxic
   brain injury from VF arrest at nursing home, and is recovering nicely.
   Patient
s cortical function returning, currently able to follow
   commands, e.g. squeezing both hands, moving eyes. Patient noted to have
   generalized seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates
   no ICH. Neurology felt that the seizure may have been in the setting of
   hypoxia after VF arrest.  She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**] for
   seizure prophylaxis and started on maintenance dilantin on [**12-30**].  A 24
   hr EEG was done which showed temporal slowing and some spikes, but no
   seizure activity.  Per neurology, goal Dilantin level should be [**9-25**].
   Corrected Dilantin level is 11 today.
   - Continue Dilantin 100mg IV TID for 7days (day [**3-18**] today), will check
   level again tomorrow & titrate PRN

   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: Patient with multiple risk factors
   for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD. She is s/p VF arrest &
   defibrillation. EKG initially showed NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization
   at OSH demonstrated severe 3VD including critical left main disease,
   but patient with negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after
   initiation of medical therapy suggesting resolution of coronary
   occlusion. Patient without episodes of arrhythmia since the day of
   admission, now off Amiodarone, Lidocaine, and Heparin gtt. Code status
   was readdressed and HCP requesting that patient receive defibrillation
   or cardioversion as needed, but no chest compressions.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - will need interventional cardiologist eval for balloon angio or Csurg
   re-evaluation for possible CABG for her severe left main disease once
   pt is more stable from resp and neuro stand point, possibly next week
   - Continuous telemetry

   # Fever, leukocytosis: WBC up today to 14.7, but patient has been
   afebrile.  Urine cultures grew klebsiella pneumoniae. Sputum cultures
   grew Moraxella catarrhalis, sensitivities pending. Repeat CXR
s clear.
   Started on IV Ceftriaxone. 1 of 4 blood cultures from the central line
   grew out coag negative staph, likely contamination.  No diarrhea. As
   patient switched to PO

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and generalized seizure activity. The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, coronary ischemia, anoxic brain encephalopathy, fever with leukocytosis, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. She is currently on various medications and has undergone interventions to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has had episodes of apnea known as sleep apnea. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and periodic ABG analysis should be done to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Close monitoring on telemetry and continuation of metoprolol are recommended to control the heart rate and prevent further arrhythmias.

3. Coronary Ischemia: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe three-vessel disease including critical left main disease. She will require an interventional cardiologist evaluation for balloon angioplasty for her severe left main disease early next week. Continuous telemetry should be maintained, and potassium and magnesium levels should be repleted.

4. Seizure Activity: The patient suffered from a generalized seizure upon arrival to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and subsequent upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient also had generalized seizure activity upon arrival to the CCU. 

The patient's current condition includes deconditioning, respiratory distress, rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation and flutter), coronary ischemia, anoxic brain encephalopathy, fever and leukocytosis, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, and pump dysfunction. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further respiratory distress, worsening of her rhythm disturbances, coronary ischemia, seizures, infection (due to the presence of leukocytosis and positive urine culture), hypertension, and gastrointestinal issues. 

The patient's treatment plan involves continuing with various medications, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) with the exception of defibrillation or cardioversion as needed. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and respond promptly to any changes or complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo F w/ DMII, HTN, HLD, and dementia transferred from OSH s/p
   cardiac arrest, complicated by upper GI bleed and generalized seizure
   activity.
   .
   # GI bleed: Recurring.  Hct stable at 34.2. PO meds were started [**12-31**].
   Patient s/p 4u pRBC
s on (2u on [**12-28**], 2u on [**12-30**]) for likely UGIB in
   setting of anticoagulation (Heparin gtt, ASA, Plavix, Integrillin).
   Currently producing 'coffee grounds' residuals with pink, clearing,
   lavage thereafter. This is likely gastric ulcers in the setting of asa,
   plavix.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] to downgrade lesions, drip if continuous bleeding
   - Hct check [**Hospital1 **] today, if stable, daily
   - GI aware
   - Transfuse for Hct goal >30
   - Active T&S ([**12-30**]), R-IJ for access
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: WBC today 18.0 from 14.6, but patient afebrile
   (though temp is climbing).  Urine cultures grew pansensitive Klebsiella
   pneumoniae. Sputum cultures grew Moraxella catarrhalis, sensitivities
   pending. Repeat CXR
s clear. Started on IV Ceftriaxone. 1 of 4 blood
   cultures from the central line grew out coag negative staph, likely
   contamination.  No diarrhea. As patient switched to PO
s & Moraxella
   likely to be chronic and not cause of pneurmonia, abx was switch back
   to Bactrim DS PO BID x 7 days.
   - Continue Bactrim, day [**5-18**]
   - F/U remaining blood cx
   - If patient develops diarrhea, can send C. diff
   - if patient febrile, will send more cultures and likely start
   clindamycin
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patient was extubated [**12-31**], ABG looked good on
   2L nasal cannula.  Patient has periods of apnea [**1-13**] known sleep apnea
   and will desaturates to 91-92 while sleeping. She is likely aspirating
   constantly; mainly her secretions. The NG tube may worsen this process.
   - Continue regular suction
   - Aspiration precaution
   - Continue Bactrim (day [**5-18**]); add clindamycin if spikes temperature
   - Wean oxygen as tolerates
   - monitor respiratory status and prn ABG
   - Atrovent and Albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Deconditioning:  Patient was extubated on [**12-31**], failed S/S eval on
   [**1-1**].  Currently very weak. PT recommending high level rehab.
   - continue TF
   - OT/PT
   .
   # Rhythm: patient was noted to have brief Afib and aflutter on tele
   [**1-2**] AM.  Resolved without intervention and without further episodes.
   - Continue Metoprolol 25mg TID, uptitrate as tolerated, target HR 60-80
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - No need for anticoagulation for now
   .
   # Coronary ischemia s/p VF arrest: s/p VF arrest & defibrillation. EKG
   initially showed NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization at OSH demonstrated
   severe 3VD including critical left main disease, but patient with
   negative troponins at OSH and EKG normalized after initiation of
   medical therapy suggesting resolution of coronary occlusion. Patient
   without episodes of arrhythmia since the day of admission, now off
   Amiodarone, Lidocaine, and Heparin gtt. Code status was readdressed and
   HCP requesting that patient receive defibrillation or cardioversion as
   needed, but no chest compressions.
   - Continue Aspirin, plavix, high dose statin, Metoprolol
   - Will need interventional cardiologist evaluation for balloon angio
   for her severe left main disease early next week
   - Continuous telemetry
   - replete K > 4, Mg > 2
   .
   # Anoxic brain encephalopathy:  Per her daughter, patient
s mental
   status is currently at her baseline.  Patient suffered from anoxic
   brain injury from VF arrest at nursing home, and is recovering well.
   Patient
s cortical function returning, currently able to follow
   commands, e.g. squeezing both hands, moving eyes. Patient noted to have
   generalized seizure activity upon arrival to CCU. CTA head demonstrates
   no ICH. Neurology felt that the seizure may have been in the setting of
   hypoxia after VF arrest.  She was loaded with Dilantin on [**12-28**] for
   seizure prophylaxis and started on maintenance Dilantin on [**12-30**].  A 24
   hr EEG was done which showed temporal slowing and some spikes, but no
   seizure activity.  Per neurology, goal Dilantin level should be [**9-25**]
   with last dose on [**1-4**]. Dilantin level this AM was 6.4, corrected for
   albumin is 9.4.
   - Continue Dilantin 100mg IV TID (day [**6-17**]); d/c today
   - f/u Neurology recs
   - Serial neuro exams
   - Seizure precautions, Ativan IV 2 mg PRN: seizures
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient previously hypotensive in the setting of Artic
   Sun, Nitro gtt, and sedation, became hypertensive with sbp
s in the
   180-190
s, treated with Labetalol and Captopril.  Now, patient
   transitioned to Metoprolol and Captopril was increased to 25mg TID. BP
   better controlled after the above dose increases.
   - continue Metoprolol 25mg TID
   - continue Captopril at 25mg TID
   .
   #  PUMP:  TTE done on [**12-29**] showed EF of mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
   hypokinesis. EF 45-50%.  Patient appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   failure.
   - continue Metoprolol 25mg TID
   - continue Captopril at 25mg TID
   .
   # HLD: Total Cholesterol 102, TG 98, HDL 34, Chol/HD 3.0, LDL <50.
   - continue Lipitor 80mg daily
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: HgbA1c 13.0%. Holding home Metformin.
   - continue HISS
   .
   #  Schizophrenia:
   - Continue home Risperdal dose
   .
   # Dementia:
   - continue Namenda 10mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # PVD: s/p AAA repair
   - continue Lipitor 80mg daily

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, complicated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed and generalized seizure activity. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has been experiencing recurring gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to gastric ulcers in the setting of anticoagulation therapy. She has received packed red blood cells transfusion and is currently producing 'coffee grounds' residuals with pink, clearing lavage. She is on proton pump inhibitor therapy and will have her hemoglobin checked daily if stable.

2. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. Urine cultures grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae, and sputum cultures grew Moraxella catarrhalis. She has been started on intravenous ceftriaxone and oral Bactrim DS PO BID x 7 days.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient has periods of apnea known as sleep apnea and desaturates to 91-92 while sleeping. She is likely aspirating constantly, mainly her secretions. The nasogastric tube may worsen this process. She will continue with regular suction, aspiration precautions, and weaning of oxygen as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dementia who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. She has a complicated medical history, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding, generalized seizure activity, respiratory distress, and coronary ischemia. The patient is currently stable but requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurring gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing recurrent GI bleeding, which has required transfusions and the use of medications to stabilize her condition. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further bleeding episodes.

2. Respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia: The patient has shown periods of apnea and desaturation while sleeping, suggesting potential sleep apnea. She also has evidence of aspiration pneumonia, likely due to her nasogastric tube. Careful monitoring and precautions to prevent aspiration are required.

3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased, indicating a possible infection. Cultures have grown pansensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, both of which may require treatment. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are needed.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and has severe coronary artery disease. She has been on various cardiac medications, including aspirin, Plavix, high-dose statin, and metoprolol. Regular monitoring of her"
