 .H/O EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED)
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), known patent foramen ovale (PFO), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recurrent epistaxis. The patient presented to the ICU with ongoing bleeding from the posterior oropharynx, which was initially thought to be a re-bleed but later determined to be a blood clot. The patient is currently on dual antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Epistaxis - Maximize blood pressure control, aim for systolic blood pressure (SBP) 100-110 per ENT. Empiric cephazolin with hemodialysis (HD). Keep Vaseline gauze dressing around alar to prevent necrosis. Plan to remove packing in 5 days, aiming for Monday with interventional radiology (IR) available in the event of bleeding. Type and screen.
2. ESRD - TRS schedule, dialyzed yesterday. Continue renal medications. Consult HD renal team in the morning.
3. Recent candidemia - Continue fluconazole with HD. Culture if spikes.
4. CAD - Continue statin and lopressor. Hold ASA, hold Plavix for now (stents placed >1 year ago).
5. HTN - Continue home"

   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU has experienced bleeding from the oral cavity, specifically bright red blood drooling out of their mouth after sipping ice water. This bleeding was likely due to a blood clot in the posterior oropharynx that re-bleeding upon stimulation. The patient's allergies include codeine, meperidine, ace inhibitors, hydrocodone, sulfa, penicillins, and lorazepam. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/41 mmHg to 168/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool device and their ABG shows a pH of 7.27. 

On physical examination, the patient appears thin with poor dentition. Their cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, but they have absent lower extremity edema. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, the patient is attentive and follows simple commands. 

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 13.6 and 13.5 K/uL, slightly elevated hematocrit (Hct) at 34.5 and 37.0, normal platelet count (Plt) at 251 and 263, and elevated creatinine (Cr) at 4.1 mg/dL. Other lab results include normal glucose levels, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), as well as abnormal calcium (Ca++) and phosphate (PO4) levels. 

The patient's plan includes continued ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate status."

 .H/O EPISTAXIS (NOSEBLEED)
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), known patent foramen ovale (PFO), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recurrent epistaxis. He was admitted to the ICU with epistaxis in the setting of dual antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. The patient re-bleed yesterday morning in the setting of an INR of 1.2, but upon evaluation by ENT, she determined that the patient was not actively bleeding. However, bright red blood was noted drooling out of the patient's mouth after taking sips of ice water this morning. The oral cavity was suctioned and rinsed until no further bleeding was noted. There was poor visualization of the posterior oropharynx yesterday, and a blood clot was collected there and re-manifested with sips of water.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), a heart rate of 99 bpm (79-105), a blood pressure of 168/46 mmHg (128/41-168/91), a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (11-22), and an oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/48 mmHg to 162/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, and no endotracheal or nasogastric tubes in place. The cardiovascular examination shows normal pulse and regular heart rhythm. The respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with scattered crackles. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. The blood glucose level is also elevated. Other lab values including creatinine, potassium, calcium, and magnesium are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include a history of altered mental status and epistaxis. The patient is off coumadin, ASA, and Plavyx, and will discuss management with ENT. The plan is to leave packing in place for 5 days. If the patient bleeds, DDAVP and PLts will be added."
