   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 103/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation support with CPAP and is receiving multiple medications including nitroglycerin, heparin, furosemide (Lasix), metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and labetalol.

The patient's physical examination reveals a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with a harsh systolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal border (RUSB) and apex. There are no thrills, lifts, S3, or S4 heart sounds. Bilateral crackles halfway up the bases are noted. There is no evidence of chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis. Extremities are warm and well perfused, with 2+ LE edema bilaterally.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. He is currently on various medications, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and antiplatelet agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PUMP: The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction and presents with acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. Potential etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, and infection. The patient also has a new productive cough but no fevers or chills. He has not been taking his Imdur recently.

2. RHYTHM: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm, but there is a concern for potential arrhythmias given his severe CAD and history of ACS. Close monitoring on telemetry is recommended.

3. CORONARIES: The patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs. He denies chest pain or usual anginal symptoms. Dynamic EKG ST changes were observed during a hypoxic episode with increased demand, but cardiac enzymes are flat x3. The patient is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. Heparin has been discontinued as unlikely ACS.

4. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient's creatinine level is elevated from baseline, likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure. Anticipated resolution with diuresis.

5. NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA: The patient has known chronic anemia at baseline. Outpatient follow-up with Heme for Epo injections is recommended.

6. DM2: Continue SSI (Subsequent Service Indicator) for diabetes management.

7. GLAUCOMA: Continue outpatient eye drops for glaucoma management.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: Cardiac heart healthy/Low sodium/diabetic diet.
- Glycemic control: Monitor blood glucose levels and manage accordingly.
- Lines: 20 Gauge - [**2171-8-31**] 11:10 PM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential complications that can arise:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms of chest tightness, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, along with the EKG changes of downsloping ST depressions in lateral leads, suggest possible ACS.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of moderate pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can lead to respiratory distress.

3. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The chest pain, EKG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) suggest the possibility of an MI.

4. Heart Failure: The patient's presentation with symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and pulmonary edema points towards heart failure, specifically diastolic heart failure.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) suggest renal dysfunction, which could be due to acute kidney injury.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings throughout the progress note indicate episodes of hypotension, which may be related to heart failure or other underlying conditions.

7. Hypoxia: The low oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) recorded during various times indicate hypoxia, likely due to pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange.

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. His current symptoms include a new productive cough but no fevers or chills. The patient has been non-compliant with his medication, specifically not taking his imdur recently.

Assessment:
1. Pump (Cardiac Function): The patient has acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. Echocardiogram from 01/27/2171 showed normal systolic function with diastolic dysfunction. Potential etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, infection.
2. Rhythm: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), but will be monitored on telemetry.
3. Coronaries: The patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). He denies chest pain or usual anginal symptoms. Dynamic EKG ST changes yesterday during hypoxic episode with increased demand, cardiac enzymes flat x3.
4. Acute on Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated from baseline 1.3, likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure. Anticipate ARF to resolve with diuresis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), severe coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has been experiencing episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and improved with nebs and Ativan. He is currently on CPAP for increased comfort.

The patient's vital signs show a low body temperature (35.2 C), low blood pressure (118/50 mmHg), and slightly elevated heart rate (66 bpm). His respiratory rate is within normal range (14 insp/min) with an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he is alert and interactive.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The troponin-T levels are within normal range, and the blood glucose level is low.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PUMP: The patient has acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. Potential etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, or infection. The patient has a new productive cough but no fevers or chills. He has not been taking his Imdur recently.

","The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient's current condition includes acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure, normocytic anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently being treated with various medications including diuretics, nifedipine, imdur, ASA, clopidogrel, carvedilol, and atorvastatin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of severe CAD and previous CABG surgery, which puts him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. The use of telemetry monitoring indicates the importance of closely monitoring the patient's heart rhythm.

2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's current creatinine level is elevated, suggesting renal impairment. This could be due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure. Close monitoring of renal function and diuresis is necessary.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient has been experiencing episodes of shortness of breath and wheezing. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is important to prevent further respiratory complications.

4. Infection: The patient presents with a new productive cough but no fevers or chills. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and consider appropriate antibiotic treatment if"

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), severe coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has been experiencing episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and elevated pressures during these episodes. He was treated with nebulizers, Ativan, CPAP, nitroglycerin, and Lasix. His urine output has been high.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms, such as worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, along with the findings of elevated pressures during episodes of shortness of breath, suggest acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. This condition can lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and increased fluid accumulation.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated (30 mEq/L), indicating hyperkalemia. This condition can be dangerous as it may cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated from baseline, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure. It is"

   Attending Progress Note
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6984**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.   Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old man with known diastolic
   heart failure who was admitted with an exacerbation of his symptoms.
   He is s/p CABG on two prior occasions.
   He has not made much progress over the past 24 hours.  He remains
   dyspneic and occasionally agitated.  His chest pain has continued
   intermittently and his diuresis has not been consistent with IV
   furosemide and hydrodiuril.
   We are currently continuing with efforts to obtain a more aggressive
   diuresis.
   He may require a right heart catheterization tomorrow to assess his
   fluid status and hemodynamics.  We are also monitoring him closely for
   the development of a pneumotic process.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and family and all
   questions addressed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure and severe coronary artery disease, who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has undergone CABG surgery twice and has had multiple percutaneous coronary interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still experiencing shortness of breath and occasional agitation. His chest pain has been intermittent, and his diuresis has been inconsistent with IV furosemide and hydrodiuril. The patient's renal function is also compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. The patient is currently on cardiac heart healthy, low sodium, and diabetic diet, and is being monitored for any signs of pneumonic process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and edema suggest an acute exacerbation of his underlying heart condition. If left untreated, this could lead to further fluid accumulation and worsening cardiac function.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate compromised renal function. AKI can occur due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute heart failure exacerbation or as a result of medication use. Close monitoring of renal function and adequate fluid balance management are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings have been consistently low"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has been diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure (CHF) on a background of chronic CHF, as well as acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.2Â°C, which is below the normal range, indicating hypothermia. The blood pressure is within an acceptable range at 118/50 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's current weight is 68.8 kg, which is unchanged from admission. The fluid balance shows an intake of 695 mL and output of 674 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 21 mL. The urine output is 674 mL over the past 24 hours.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and CPAP/PSV ventilator mode. The tidal volume is 837 mL, respiratory rate is spontaneous, PEEP is set at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 is 95%, and the peak inspiratory pressure is 14 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, PaO2 of 65 mmHg, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 108.

In terms of physical examination, the peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, and the skin, neurologic, and respiratory assessments are also not performed. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count at 212 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level at 8.9 g/dL, elevated creatinine level at 2.4 mg/dL, and high potassium level at 30 mEq/L. Other lab results include elevated troponin T levels, low bicarbonate level, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient is currently being treated with heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and there are no other medications mentioned. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the disposition is ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include worsening heart failure, further decline in renal function, electrolyte imbalances (particularly hyperkalemia), and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation."

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea. He is on multiple medications including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and antiplatelet agents.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor peripheral pulses and unassessed neurologic status. His lab results show elevated creatinine levels and anemia. The echocardiogram from 1/27/2171 shows normal systolic function with diastolic dysfunction.

The patient's current assessment includes acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure, potential etiologies including medication noncompliance, ischemia, or infection. The plan includes continuing diuretic therapy, initiating another diuretic, discontinuing nitroglycerin, increasing imdur dosage, and obtaining sputum and blood cultures. A transthoracic echocardiogram is also planned for tomorrow.

The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm, and he has known severe coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. His acute kidney injury is likely due to poor forward flow secondary to acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, and it is anticipated to resolve with diuresis"

","The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient's current medications include ASA, Clopidogrel, Carvedilol, Atorvastatin, and Lasix. 

On examination, the patient is alert and interactive, breathing comfortably on a venti mask. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a regular rate and regular rhythm. He has a systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and a systolic murmur at the apex. The patient also has rales at the lower lung fields bilaterally and tubular breath sounds at the left lung base. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and there is no lower extremity edema.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His maximum temperature recorded was 36.2 degrees Celsius.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, glucose of 234 mg/dL, sodium of 136 mEq/L, potassium of 28 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mg/dL, and magnesium of 2.6 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal moderate cardiomegaly, mild bilateral pleural effusions, and unchanged extent of bilateral perihilar opacities with signs indicative of mild overhydration. A transthoracic echo showed preserved ejection fraction of 55%, mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.

Microbiology results indicate extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions, rendering the bacterial culture results invalid. The patient's medical history is significant for chronic diastolic heart failure, severe CAD, and CABG.

Based on the information provided, the patient appears to have an acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. Potential etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, or infection. The patient's chest pain overnight resolved with nitro, morphine, nebs, and ativan, without EKG changes or elevation in cardiac enzymes.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing diuretics, aiming for negative fluid balance of 60-100 cc/hr, and monitoring renal function. The patient is also advised to continue taking ASA, Clopidogrel, Carvedilol, and Atorvastatin."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has preserved systolic function but diastolic dysfunction, which indicates acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. Other potential etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, or infection. The patient has a new productive cough but no fevers or chills. Good diuresis was observed overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms of worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema suggest an acute worsening of his chronic diastolic heart failure. This condition can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (110/44 mmHg), indicating hypotension. This may be due to his heart failure or medication side effects. It needs to be closely monitored and managed to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests acute renal failure. This could be due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure. Close monitoring of renal function and continued di"

   Attending Progress Note
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] today and I
   concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment
   plan.  The physical examination is consistent with mine today.    Mr.
   [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old man with known diastolic heart failure who was
   admitted with an exacerbation of his symptoms.  He is s/p CABG on two
   prior occasions.
   Fortunately, he seems to have responded to the combination of
   bumetidine and hydrodiuril for diuresis and was negative 1.5L over the
   past 24 hours.  His breathing has improved as well.   He and his family
   also state that his hemocrit is generally maintain over 30% to avoid
   angina (with Epogen), and his Hct within the ICU has been closer to
   27.5.    Given his improved diuresis with intermittent angina, we will
   plan to transfuse 1 U PRBCs.
   Over the next 24 hours, we will continue ginger diuresis, pulmonary
   toilet, and attempt to increase his time in a chair to maximize his
   ventilations and tidal volumes.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and family and all
   questions addressed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). He presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient's condition was complicated by a hypoxic episode with dynamic EKG ST changes, increased cardiac enzymes, chest pain, and an ineffective nitroglycerin drip. However, these symptoms resolved with the administration of morphine, nebulizers, and ativan.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 110/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on high flow nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. His weight remains stable at 68.8 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,180 mL and output of 2,670 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,490 mL. The patient is receiving Bumex and diuresing well, with a target of negative 100 cc/hr.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, moderate cardiomegaly, mild bilateral pleural effusions, and unchanged extent of bilateral perihilar opacities with signs indicative of mild overhydration. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opac"

","The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) who presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). 

The patient's chest pain overnight was managed with nitroglycerin, morphine, nebulized medications, and ativan, and the cardiac enzymes remained flat. The patient's EKG showed dynamic ST changes during the hypoxic episode but no changes overnight. 

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine level is elevated from baseline, likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure. The electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. 

The patient's imaging shows moderate cardiomegaly, mild bilateral pleural effusions, and unchanged extent of bilateral perihilar opacities with signs indicative of mild overhydration. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing diuretics, converting to oral diuretics, initiating imdur at home dose, discontinuing nitro drip, continuing nifedipine (considering switching to hydralazine for better afterload reduction), and monitoring for improvement in fluid status.

1. Acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms and echocardiogram findings suggest an acute worsening of his diastolic heart failure. This can be caused by medication non-compliance, ischemia, or infection.

2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known severe CAD with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There were dynamic EKG ST changes during a hypoxic episode, but chest pain overnight resolved with nitro, morphine, nebs, and ativan, with flat cardiac enzymes.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's current creatinine level is elevated from baseline, likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure. It is anticipated that ARF will resolve with diuresis.

4. Normocytic anemia: The patient has known chronic anemia at baseline, and it is being followed by Heme as an outpatient for Epo injections.

5. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient's diabetes management is ongoing with SSI.

6. Glaucoma: The patient's glaucoma management continues as an outpatient.

In terms of medical interventions, the patient is receiving aggressive diuresis with Lasix, Bumex, and diuril. The goal is negative fluid balance of 60-100 cc/hr. Nitro drip has been discontinued. The patient is also receiving medications such as nifedipine (considering switching to hydralazine for better afterload reduction), imdur for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) 90-100, and ASA, clopidogrel, carvedilol, and atorvastatin for coronary artery disease management. The patient is also being monitored for rhythm disturbances, acute renal failure, and normocytic anemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic diastolic dysfunction. He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has been hospitalized and experienced episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath, which improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times. He also has a productive cough but no fevers or chills. The patient had good diuresis yesterday and overnight on bumex drip. Nitro drip was discontinued yesterday and the patient was placed on long-acting PO Nitro. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. PUMP: The patient has acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. Etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, and infection. The patient's diuresis will be continued with bumex drip at 0.5mg/hr, uptitrated as needed. Metolazone will be continued at 5mg. The patient will also continue taking Imdur at home dose and Nifedipine CR 30mg. Consider switching to hydralazine for better afterload reduction.
2. CORONARIES: The patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs. He denies chest pain or usual anginal symptoms. Dynamic EKG ST changes during hypoxic episode with increased demand, cardiac enzymes flat x3"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He also experienced episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath while hospitalized, which improved with a combination of medications including nitroglycerin, morphine, and Ativan.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 112/41 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The physical examination reveals rales in the lower lung fields, a regular rate and rhythm, and an apical systolic murmur.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 212 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, elevated potassium level of 34 mEq/L, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 151 mg/dL. The creatinine level is elevated from baseline at 2.4 mg/dL. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels and cardiac enzymes within normal range.

   Attending Progress Note
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.  The physical examination is consistent with mine
   today.    Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old man with known diastolic heart
   failure who was admitted with an exacerbation of his symptoms.  He is
   s/p CABG on two prior occasions.
   He continues to respond to the combination of bumetidine and
   hydrodiuril for diuresis and was again negative 1.8L over the past 24
   hours.  His breathing has improved as well and he spent most of the
   morning is a chair.
   Over the next 24 hours, we will continue ginger diuresis.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and family and all
   questions addressed.

","Summary:
The patient, a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure and severe coronary artery disease, is admitted with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has had episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath while hospitalized, which have improved with a combination of medications. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/41 to 133/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels but are otherwise within normal range. The patient has a new productive cough but no fevers or chills. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient presents with acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure, potentially due to medication noncompliance, ischemia, or infection. The patient has shown good diuresis with bumetanide and will continue this medication, along with metolazone, imdur, nifedipine, and carvedilol. The patient's ACE inhibitor allergy and history of hyperkalemia will be considered when determining further treatment options. The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is expected to resolve with effective diuresis. 

Potential Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's symptoms of"

   diastolic dysfunction, echo [**9-2**] showed consistent findings. Patient
   presents with acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure.
   Potential etiologies include medication non compliance, ischemia,
   infection. Patient has productive cough, though no fevers (Tmax 99.2)
   or chills.  Good diuresis yesterday & overnight on bumex drip (did not
   quite meet goal of negative 1L, was negative 800mL).
   -Aim for negative 100 cc/hr urine output again
   -Continue Bumex (bumetanide) drip at 0.5mg/hr, uptitrate as needed
   -Continue metolazone at 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue Imdur at home dose = 90mg daily
   -Continue Nifedipine CR 30mg [**Hospital1 **] (consider switching to hydralazine for
   better afterload reduction)
   -Consider RH cath if no improvement fluid status; not necessary today
   as pt diuresed well on Bumex so will continue with Bumex drip

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 382-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), severe coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has had a few episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath while hospitalized, which improved with a combination of medications.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, anemia, and acute kidney injury. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium.

The patient is currently being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. The potential etiologies include medication noncompliance, ischemia, and infection. The patient has a productive cough but no fevers.

The assessment and plan include diuresis management, adjustment of heart medications, monitoring of electrolytes and renal function, and follow-up on sputum culture. The patient's current regimen includes bumetanide drip for diuresis, metolazone, isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), nifedipine, and acetazolamide.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), infection (such as pneumonia), electrolyte imbalances, and further deterioration of renal function.

   Attending Progress Note
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.  The physical examination is consistent with mine
   today.    Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old man with known diastolic heart
   failure who was admitted with an exacerbation of his symptoms.  He is
   s/p CABG on two prior occasions.
   His diuresis slowed over the past 24 hour period although he continues
   on the combination of bumetidine and hydrodiuril for diuresis.  His
   breathing has improved as well and he spent most of the morning is a
   chair but his lungs remain wet by examination.  His creatinine has
   increased from 2.4 to 2.7 over the past 24 hours.  He has also
   developed a mild hypochrolemic metabolic alkalosis.
   Over the next 24 hours, we will continue diuresis as needed to mobilize
   > 1 L net negative.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure and severe coronary artery disease who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient's symptoms improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times. The patient's current condition includes acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure, normocytic anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/54 mmHg to 130/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow oxygen neb. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as a slightly decreased bicarbonate level. The patient has been diagnosed with acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure, normocytic anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The treatment plan includes continuing bumetanide drip at 0.5mg/hr, metolazone, Imdur, Nifedipine CR, and considering RH catheterization if no improvement in fluid status. The patient will also be monitored for sputum culture results and daily Hct levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] yo M with a history of dCHF, severe CAD s/p CABG who presents with
   worsening dyspnea on exertion, associated with orthopnea, and lower
   extremity edema. Has had a few episodes of CP/SOB while hospitalized,
   improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times.
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo from [**2171-1-27**] showed normal systolic function with
   diastolic dysfunction, echo [**9-2**] showed consistent findings. Patient
   presents with acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure.
   Potential etiologies include medication non compliance, ischemia,
   infection. Patient has productive cough, though no fevers (Tmax 99.2).
   Good diuresis yesterday & overnight on bumex drip (negative 1.3L).
   -Aim for negative 1L over next 24 hours
   -Continue Bumex (bumetanide) drip at 0.5mg/hr, uptitrate as needed to
   meet diuresis goal
   -Continue metolazone at 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue Imdur at home dose = 90mg daily
   -Continue Nifedipine CR 30mg [**Hospital1 **] (consider switching to hydralazine for
   better afterload reduction)
   -CXR today
   -Continue Acetazolamide 250mg PO q12 hours through today to treat
   contraction alkalosis from diuresis; monitor HCO3 daily
   .
   #RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
 weaned down to 2L NC during last 24 hours, and
   is breathing more comfortably now. Less likely pneumonia as afebrile,
   no leukocytosis; consider pulmonary edema as most likely cause.
   -diuresis as above
   -continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   -f/u sputum culture
   -f/u CXR
   -follow temperature, WBC
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs.
   Denies CP, or usual anginal symptoms. Dynamic EKG ST changes during
   hypoxic episode [**8-31**] with increased demand, cardiac enzymes flat x3.
   -Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, Carvedilol, Atorvastatin, Imdur
   -Patient has ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 239**] listed as allergy [**12-31**] hyperkalemia
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in NSR, monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Current Cr elevated from baseline
   1.3, likely [**12-31**] poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation
   of diastolic heart failure. Anticipate ARF will resolve with effective
   diuresis. Cr relatively stable today.
   -Continue diuresis as outlined above
   -Check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   -Follow Cr
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia: Patient has known chronic anemia at baseline.
   Followed by Heme as outpatient, for Epo injections.   Usually receives
   epo injection on Tuesday for hct <33, per pt report.  Received Epo on
   [**9-4**]. Guiac positive. Hct stable/improved.

   Medical Decision Making;   Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old man with known
   diastolic heart failure who was admitted with an exacerbation of his
   symptoms.  He is s/p CABG on two prior occasions.
   With the addition of bumex, metalazone, and Diamox for diuresis, he is
   1.3 L negative over the past 24 hours.  His breathing has improved
   substantially over the past 2 days although he still feels that he is
   weak.  We have encourage Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] to increase his activity and we
   will try to ambulate his tomorrow.
   Over the next 24 hours, we will continue diuresis as needed to mobilize
   > 1 L net negative.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. This condition can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.

2. Pulmonary edema: Given the patient's history of heart failure and current symptoms of respiratory distress, pulmonary edema is a possibility. This condition can cause shortness of breath and coughing due to fluid accumulation in the lungs.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from baseline, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Poor forward flow during the exacerbation of diastolic heart failure may contribute to this condition.

4. Contraction alkalosis: Diuretic therapy may result in contraction alkalosis, which is characterized by a decrease in blood volume and subsequent increase in serum bicarbonate concentration. Monitoring HCO3 levels is important to detect and manage this condition.

5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has known severe CAD and has undergone CABG surgery. There is a risk of ongoing ischemia or myocardial infarction, especially during times of increased cardiac demand.

6. Normocytic anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, and it is essential to monitor hemoglobin levels regularly. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding (indicated by"

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), severe coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has been experiencing episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath while hospitalized, which improved with a combination of nitroglycerin, morphine, and Ativan.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PUMP: The patient's echocardiogram showed normal systolic function with diastolic dysfunction. He is presenting with an acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. Potential etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, or infection. The patient has a productive cough but no fevers. Good diuresis was achieved yesterday and overnight with bumex drip, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1.3 liters. Aim for a negative fluid balance of 1 liter over the next 24 hours. Continue bumex drip at 0.5 mg/hr, uptitrate as needed. Continue metolazone at 5 mg. Continue Imdur at home dose of 90 mg daily. Consider switching to hydralazine for better afterload reduction. Obtain chest X-ray today. Continue acetazolamide 250 mg PO q12 hours to treat contraction alkalosis from diuresis; monitor bicarbonate daily."

","The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure and severe coronary artery disease who presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He has had episodes of chest pain while hospitalized but improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times. He is currently diuresing well on Bumex.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), blood pressure of 130/44 mmHg, heart rate of 68 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. He is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination shows no abdominal distention, no pedal edema, and crackles bilaterally in the lungs. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes diastolic heart failure, severe coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting, and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions. He also has a history of chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, glaucoma, and diarrhea (previously constipation), which is likely due to overmedication, although Clostridium difficile infection has been ruled out.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and severe coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, suggesting an acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. 

The patient has been diuresed with bumex drip, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1L over the next 24 hours. He is also on metolazone, imdur, and nifedipine CR, with consideration for switching to hydralazine for better afterload reduction. A chest X-ray has been ordered today. 

The patient's respiratory distress has improved, and he has been weaned down to 2L NC. It is less likely that pneumonia is the cause, given his lack of fever and normal white blood cell count. Pulmonary edema is considered the most likely cause, and diuresis will be continued. 

The patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). He denies chest pain or usual anginal symptoms, but had dynamic EKG ST changes during a hypoxic episode with increased demand, with flat cardiac enzymes three times. 

The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and will be monitored on telemetry. He has acute on chronic renal"

   Medical Decision Making;   Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old man with known
   diastolic heart failure who was admitted with an exacerbation of his
   symptoms.  He is s/p CABG on two prior occasions.
   With the addition of bumex, metalazone, and Diamox for diuresis, he is
   negative over 2L over the past 24 hours.
   Although his breathing has improved substantially over the past several
   days, he complains that he is weak and cannot stand and walk.
   We will help Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] increase his physical activity and ambulation.
   He is now sitting comfortably in a chair.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure and severe coronary artery disease who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.
- He has had episodes of congestive pulmonary symptoms while hospitalized but has improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 130/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals an end-expiratory grunt and crackles bilaterally in the lungs, as well as a harsh apical sound and an S3 heart sound.
- The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels.
- The patient's ejection fraction is normal based on an echocardiogram from 1/27/21.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure, with potential etiologies including medication noncompliance, ischemia, or infection.
- The treatment plan includes diuresis with bumetanide and metolazone, as well as the continuation of Imdur, nifedipine, and other medications.
- The patient is weaned down to 2L nasal cannula and is breathing more comfortably now.
- The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is expected to resolve with effective diuresis.
- The patient has a history of chronic anemia and is receiving epo injections.
- The patient denies chest pain or anginal symptoms and has dynamic EKG ST changes during hypoxic episodes.
- The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm, and he is being monitored on telemetry.
- The patient's diarrhea, previously constipation, is likely due to overmedication, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out.
- The patient's glaucoma and diabetes mellitus type 2 are being managed as outpatient.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and famotidine for stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's recent improvement in respiratory symptoms makes pneumonia less likely. However, it should still be monitored for given the risk factors.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate potential acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is necessary.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level may require close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Diarrhea: Although C. diff has been ruled"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), severe coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), who presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He has had episodes of chest pain (CP)/shortness of breath (SOB) while hospitalized, but has improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times. His condition has improved with diuresis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms suggest an acute worsening of his chronic diastolic heart failure. Potential etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, or infection.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has been weaned down to 2L NC during the last 24 hours and is breathing more comfortably now. Less likely pneumonia as the patient is afebrile, without leukocytosis; pulmonary edema is the most likely cause.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). He denies CP or usual anginal symptoms. Dynamic EKG ST changes during hypoxic episode with increased demand, cardiac enzymes flat x3.

","Summary:
The patient is a 382-year-old male with a history of diastolic heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has been hospitalized a few times for chest pain and shortness of breath, but his condition has improved with diuretic therapy. The patient's recent echocardiogram showed normal systolic function with diastolic dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms and history suggest that he may be experiencing an acute worsening of his chronic diastolic heart failure. This can lead to further fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored due to the risk of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Weaning off oxygen and diuresis will be important in managing this complication.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known severe coronary artery disease with previous interventions. There is a risk of ischemia or myocardial infarction, especially during times of increased cardiac demand or stress.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury. Effective diuresis and close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function are crucial to prevent worsening renal failure.
5. Normocytic anemia: The patient has chronic an"

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6984**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and plan.
   I was present during the entire physical examination with the
   housestaff.

   Medical Decision Making;   Mr. [**Known lastname 10470**] is a [**Age over 90 382**] year old man with known
   diastolic heart failure who was admitted with an exacerbation of his
   symptoms.  He is s/p CABG on two prior occasions.
   With the addition of bumex, metalazone, and Diamox for diuresis, he is
   negative over 2L again over the past 24 hours.
   His breathing has continued to improve substantially over the past
   several days.  His only complaint is that of weakness and he reports
   that he is weak and cannot stand and walk.  We will work on his
   ambulation today.
   Over the next 24 hours, we will continue transition his diuretics to
   oral Bumex and metalozone.   We will add IV furosemide as needed to
   diuresis an addition 1 L net negative today.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

   on:[**2171-9-8**] 13:54 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of diastolic heart failure who presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has had episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath while hospitalized, but these symptoms have improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/52 to 128/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus bradycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals third heart sound with systolic ejection murmur and end-expiratory grunt and crackles bilaterally in the lungs. There is no pedal edema noted. The patient's weight is 59.9 kg, down from 68.8 kg on admission.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 195 mg/dL, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.9 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.6 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 4.9 mg/dL. The platelet count is within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. PUMP: The patient has acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure. Medication noncompliance, ischemia, and infection are potential etiologies. The patient will be transferred to bumex PO today in anticipation of floor transfer.

2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: The patient has been weaned down to 2L NC during the last 24 hours and is breathing more comfortably now. Pulmonary edema is the most likely cause. Diuresis as previously outlined will continue, and the patient will be weaned off oxygen as tolerated.

3. CORONARIES: The patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs. Denies chest pain or usual anginal symptoms. Dynamic EKG ST changes during hypoxic episode with increased demand, cardiac enzymes flat x3. Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, Carvedilol, Atorvastatin, Imdur.

4. RHYTHM: Currently in NSR, monitor on telemetry.

5. Acute on chronic renal failure: Current Cr elevated from baseline of 1.3, likely poor forward flow in the setting of acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure. Will obtain urine lytes today given recent bump."

","Summary:
The patient is a 382-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), severe coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He has had episodes of congestive pulmonary symptoms (CP/SOB) while hospitalized but improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times. His overall condition has improved with diuresis.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms and echocardiogram findings indicate an acute worsening of his diastolic heart failure. Potential etiologies include medication non-compliance, ischemia, or infection. The patient has a productive cough but no fevers.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient was previously on high-flow oxygen but has been successfully weaned down to 2L nasal cannula. He is now breathing more comfortably. The most likely cause of his respiratory distress is pulmonary edema, rather than pneumonia, as he is afebrile with no leukocytosis.

3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known severe CAD s/p CABG with multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). He denies chest pain or usual anginal symptoms. However, dynamic EKG ST changes occurred during a hypoxic episode, indicating increased cardiac demand. Cardiac enzymes were"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), severe coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), presenting with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has had episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath while hospitalized, but has improved with diuretics. The patient's condition is consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure, potentially due to medication non-compliance, ischemia, or infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a productive cough and is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his compromised respiratory status.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, which may be exacerbated by the use of ACE inhibitors and other medications.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible worsening renal function. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is essential.
4. Normocytic anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, and it is important to monitor hemoglobin levels and provide appropriate treatment, such as erythropoietin injections.
5. Diarrhea: The patient previously experienced constipation, but now has diarrhea, which could be related to medication overuse or Clostridium difficile infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 382-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), severe coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has had a few episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath while hospitalized, but these symptoms improved with medication.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6Â°C (96Â°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/46 to 131/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally in the lungs and no pedal edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6-8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.5-13.9 g/dL, creatinine level of 2.3-2.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 95-184 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.3-5.8 mEq/L, sodium level of 135-145 mg/dL, chloride level of 85-102 mEq/L, and magnesium level of 2.6 mg/dL.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. The patient has been hospitalized and experienced episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath, which improved with nitro/morphine/Ativan combination at various times. His condition has improved with diuresis.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/46 to 131/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His temperature is slightly elevated at 35.8 degrees Celsius. The physical examination reveals third heart sound with systolic murmur and crackles in both lungs. His weight has decreased from 68.8 kg at admission to 57.1 kg currently.

Laboratory results indicate elevated potassium levels and slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, suggesting myocardial injury. Other lab values, including white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes, are relatively stable.

The patient's acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure is being treated with diuretics, including bumex and diuril"
