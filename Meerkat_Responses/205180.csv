","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of EtOH seizures. He had a witnessed grand mal seizure lasting four minutes on 3/16 and was taken to Lawrence Hospital. The CT scan was negative, and he received vol resus and observation. He was sectioned 12ed and sent to Hospital 250. He was noted to have DTs, given ativan 2mg iv x2, and sent back to Hospital. He has been in the ICU since admission. The patient received 425 mg Diazepam in 6 hours since admission and 2.5 L NS, showing slight improvement in the tachycardic NASAL SWAB results. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's temperature is elevated at 38.3 degrees Celsius, indicating a possible infection. This could be due to sepsis or another source of infection.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol use and is currently showing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including DTs. This can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium, and even death if not properly managed.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated potassium level (K+ 5.8 mEq/L) and a low magnesium level (Mg++ 1.2 mg/dL). These imbalances can affect cardiac function and muscle control.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows"

   Assessment and Plan
   DT: Last drink was 3 days prior to admission and his adrenergic
   symptoms consisting of disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension,
   agitation & diaphoresis. This is consistent with DT. Patient received
   MVI/Thiamine/Folate in ED and in the unit. CT head negative.
   - Continue Valium 10 mg IV q15m for CIWA > 10, patient received 425mg
   so far.
   - since Ativan and Valium both have polyethylene glycol, will monitor
   for non-gap acidosis
   - checking 4pm lytes, if gap develops will switch to Versed
   - Low threshold for Ativan gtt if patient starts to have seizures
   - D5
 NS afterwards
   - CXR
   - maintain 2 PIVs
   Volume status
 patient appears to be a little dry,

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a chief complaint of 24-hour events in the ICU. The patient's history includes propoxyphene allergy, unknown allergies, and last dose of antibiotics on [**2159-3-20**]. The patient has been receiving infusions of Haloperidol (Haldol) and Diazepam (Valium). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

24-Hour Events:
- Psych recommendations were made, suggesting the use of Valium at a standing dose of 15mg PO TID with daily tapering. In addition, Haldol was recommended for agitation at 2.5mg IV q2h prn. Monitoring of EKG for QTc prolongation was also suggested.
- The patient improved over the course of the day until late afternoon when he became more awake and unruly.
- Around 6 pm, the patient's right hand turned cyanotic with palpable pulses. Vascular and hand consultations were sought, and an ultrasound confirmed basilic thrombosis.
- The patient had low urine output with no changes in creatinine, and a 500 cc bolus was given twice overnight, resulting in slight improvement.
- Hand team is performing serial exams, and no surgical intervention is planned.
- Vascular team did not recommend anticoagulation for the clot, and further evaluation will be done in the morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient has been aggressive, diaphoretic, and combative. He has been given Valium and Haldol for these symptoms. The patient's right hand turned cyanotic with palpable pulses, and a basilic thrombosis was found on ultrasound. The patient has had low urine output with no changes in creatinine, receiving two 500 cc boluses overnight. Serial exams are being done by the hand team, and the vascular team did not recommend anticoagulation for the clot, to be followed up in the morning.

Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), and hallucinations if not managed properly.
2. Thrombosis: The presence of a basilic thrombosis indicates a potential blood clot formation, which can cause further complications like pulmonary embolism if dislodged.
3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has low urine output and abnormal electrolyte levels (e.g., low potassium), indicating possible fluid and electrolyte disorders that need correction.
4. Infection: The patient is experiencing fever, which could indicate an underlying infection that needs to be identified and treated promptly.
5. Potential organ damage: Elevated levels of lactic acid, LDH, and troponin"

   Assessment and Plan
   DT: Last drink was 7 days prior to admission and his adrenergic
   symptoms consisting of disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension,
   agitation & diaphoresis. This is consistent with DT. Patient received
   MVI/Thiamine/Folate in ED and in the unit. CT head negative.
   - Continue Valium 10 mg IV q15m for CIWA > 10, patient received 425mg
   so far.
   - since Ativan and Valium both have polyethylene glycol, will monitor
   for non-gap acidosis
   - checking 4pm lytes, if gap develops will switch to Versed
   - Low threshold for Ativan gtt if patient starts to have seizures
   - D5
 NS afterwards
   - CXR
   - maintain 2 PIVs
   Volume status
 patient appears to be a little dry,
   -          Bolus with NS for tachycardia, given 2.5L NS
   -          Will maintain good urine output to prevent renal failure
   from a potential rhabdo
   Psych: obtained OSH and psych facility records
   -          will c/s psych today, maintain section 12

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of delirium tremens (DT) due to alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/80 mmHg to 148/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient has been receiving Valium (diazepam) intravenously for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, with a total of 425 mg given so far. Due to the presence of polyethylene glycol in both Valium and Ativan, there is a concern for non-gap acidosis, so the plan is to monitor the patient for this condition and switch to Versed if necessary.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), along with decreased hematocrit (Hct) and blood glucose levels. The kidney function tests (Cr) are within normal limits. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac enzymes are also provided.

The patient's physical examination reveals an anxious and diaphoretic appearance, hyperdynamic pulse, clear lung sounds, and absent peripheral pulses in both hands. Neurological assessment is not possible at the moment due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

The plan for the patient includes continuing Valium IV for CI"
