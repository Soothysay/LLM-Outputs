","The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man admitted with decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and tachycardia, which are consistent with septic shock. Close monitoring and aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with normal saline (NS) along with vasopressor support are required. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn, Azithro) should be continued pending culture data. Blood cultures, fluid aspirate, and surveillance blood cultures should be followed up.

2. Right anterior groin abscess: The patient has a right anterior groin collection that was attempted to be aspirated in the emergency department. The fluid sent for analysis showed probable polymicrobial collection. General surgery and orthopedics consults are needed for probable surgical intervention given the findings and location. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued.

3. Decubitus ulcerations: The patient has chronic decubitus ulcers with wound-Vacs in place. Wound care nursing consult is recommended. Monitoring for signs of infection should be continued, and broad-spectrum antibiotics likely cover this area adequately.

4. Productive cough: The patient's symptoms may be of upper respiratory origin,"

","The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with multiple medical conditions, including decubitus ulcers, chronic pain, alteration in nutrition, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and potential sources of infection such as a right anterior thigh fluid collection or abscess, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, abdominal infection, or decubitus ulcers. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Spread of infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to sepsis and chronic conditions, making him susceptible to further infections.
2. Organ dysfunction: If the infection spreads or if the sepsis progresses, it could lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular issues.
3. Failure to respond to treatment: The patient may not respond adequately to the current antibiotic regimen, leading to persistent or worsening infection.
4. Development of antibiotic resistance: Prolonged exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it more difficult to treat future infections.
5. Complications related to surgical intervention: If surgical intervention is required, there is a risk of surgical site infections, bleeding, or other surgical complications.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and chronic condition increase the risk of developing new pressure ulcers or the worsening of existing ones.

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   History reviewed. 58 yo ex-60 py smoker, paraplegic, decubitus ulcers,
   urostomy, ostomy, LUL T2N0 poorly diff adenoCA, multiple pneumothoraces
   s/p pleurodesis  admitted with septic shock from pelvic abscess.
   Presented [**4-19**] in septic shock initially with f/c/sob and productive
   cough of white sputum, light headiness, increased thirst and nausea.
   He was febrile and tachy at NH with BP 98/60, pulse up to 180 and
   received adenosine by EMS during transport to [**Hospital1 19**].  In ED, tachy and
   hypotensive.  T 101, P 150, BP 70/40  RR 17 100% NRB and room air.
   Left IJ CVL inserted, started on neosynephrine, and given 4 L IV
   fluids.  Abdomen tender though patient reports this is at baseline.
   Labs WBC 23 with 17% bands, Cr 1.3 lactate 4.7.  UA from suprapubic
   cath shows 21wbc and bacteria.  Cultures sent, pt given vanc 22:00
   /zosyn 23:00/azithro.  CT abd/pelvis shows a fluid collection with rim
   enhancement in the right pelvis. Drain was placed by IR with drainage
   of pus [**4-20**]. Gram stain shows 3+ polys with GNRs and GPCs in pairs and
   chains.
   Overnight/day events notable for: ascess fluid positive for GPCs,
   suggestive of Strep. Blood cultures remain no growth. Episode of SVT
   yesterday with no recurrence. Labs significant for improving
   leukocytosis. Being weaned off pressors. Went to the OR for washout of
   pelvic abscess and reportedly had 300 cc of additional pus drained.
   Remains on Vanc/Zosyn - agree with d/c of azithro. Overall improving
   sepsis with shock. Respiratory status acceptable with good sats but
   concern for volume overload (LOS ~ 11 L positive including ED fluids).
   Rest of the plan as outlined above in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7173**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic male with a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. He presented with septic shock from a pelvic abscess and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's initial presentation included fever, cough, light-headedness, increased thirst, and nausea. He was febrile and tachycardic with low blood pressure upon arrival at the hospital. In the emergency department, he received adenosine during transport and was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic again. An intra-jugular central venous line was inserted, norepinephrine was started, and he received 4 liters of IV fluids. His abdomen was tender, but he reported this as being at baseline. Laboratory results showed an elevated white blood cell count with 17% bands, creatinine level of 1.3, and lactate level of 4.7. Urinalysis from the suprapubic catheter showed 21 white blood cells and bacteria. Cultures were sent, and he was given vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a fluid collection with rim enhancement in the right pelvis. An interventional radiology procedure was performed to drain the abscess, resulting in the drainage of pus. Gram stain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic male with a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He has a right anterior groin abscess that is suspected to be the source of sepsis shock. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) and has ongoing fluid resuscitation. There are concerns about hardware infection and the need for orthopedic surgery consult. The patient's decubitus ulcers are chronic and being managed with wound care nursing consult. The patient's paraplegia, GERD, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and fenestration are also noted, along with ongoing medical management and nutrition consult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis shock due to the right hip abscess.
2. Infection of hardware in the patient's body, which may require surgical intervention.
3. Complications related to the patient's chronic decubitus ulcers, such as wound infection or further tissue breakdown.
4. Potential need for a more aggressive approach to glycemic control due to the patient's ICU stay and potential surgery.
5. Risk of venous thromboembolism (DVT) due to immobility and ICU stay.
6. Stress ulceration due to critical illness and the need for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic male with multiple comorbidities, including decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and chronic pain. He presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and septic shock. The possible sources of infection include the urine, decubitus ulcers, pulmonary, abdominal, or right anterior thigh fluid collection. 

The patient is currently being treated with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn). Blood cultures, fluid aspirate, and surveillance blood cultures have been sent for analysis. Consults have been requested from general surgery and orthopedics.

Additionally, the patient has a right anterior groin collection that was attempted to be washed out in the operating room, and fluid was sent for analysis. This fluid shows probable polymicrobial collection.

The patient also has chronic decubitus ulcerations, for which wound care nursing consult has been requested. The patient's productive cough is likely of upper respiratory origin, but further evaluation with a chest X-ray after adequate fluid resuscitation is recommended.

The patient's abdominal pain is chronic and migratory in nature, with no acute changes seen on CT. General surgery recommendations have been appreciated.

The patient's paraplegia requires"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The most likely source of infection is a right hip/groin abscess, given findings from an interventional radiology tap. The patient is currently receiving vasopressor support and has had a surgical drainage of the abscess. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including anemia, decubitus ulcers, chronic pain, alteration in nutrition, GERD, hyperlipidemia, and paraplegia. The patient's condition requires a multidisciplinary approach involving general surgery, orthopedics, wound care nursing, and nutrition consults.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis with septic shock: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are consistent with sepsis, which can lead to septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has chronic decubitus ulcers with wound-Vacs in place. These ulcers can become infected and worsen if not properly managed.

3. Right anterior groin collection: The patient has a collection in the right anterior groin that was drained surgically. There is a concern for polymicrobial infection in this"

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of right hip surgery and subsequent infection. The patient underwent debridement of the infected tissue and was started on various antibiotics. He remains pressor-dependent and has shown no improvement in his condition.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains on Gram stain, and positive blood cultures suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has multiple sacral decubitus ulcers, some with wound vacs in place, indicating the possibility of pressure ulcers developing due to prolonged immobility.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has mild bilateral lower extremity edema, which increases the risk for DVT.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's chronic pain and alteration in nutrition may contribute to malnutrition.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion.
6. Respiratory Complications: Although the patient is not currently on respiratory support, his tachypnea and low oxygen saturation may indicate early signs of respiratory distress.
7. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction.
8. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/PTT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of right hip surgery and was found to have purulent drainage in the surgical site. The patient is pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), blood pressure ranging from 92/47-77/39 mmHg, heart rate between 63-91 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving phenylephrine infusion and various medications including omeprazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and azithromycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis without organ dysfunction suggests a systemic inflammatory response likely caused by a bacterial infection. If not appropriately managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction.

2. Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient is currently categorized as sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a risk of developing organ dysfunction if the underlying infection is not effectively treated. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and organ function is crucial to detect any signs of deterioration.

3. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic male with a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for septic shock, likely secondary to a right hip abscess. The patient has multiple sacral decubitus ulcers, some with wound-vacs in place, and bilateral ankle ulcers. He also has contracted extremities and is paraplegic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for septic shock, and there is a concern for additional sources of infection, such as hardware infection from previous surgeries.
2. Decubitus Ulcerations: The patient's chronic decubitus ulcers are at risk for worsening due to immobility and potential infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient continues to require low-dose pressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating ongoing hypotension.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and presence of central venous lines.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition may be compromised due to decreased oral intake and potential malabsorption from colostomy/urostomy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic male who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. He has a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and is currently being treated for a right hip abscess as the source of sepsis shock. The patient is also experiencing chronic pain, alteration in nutrition, and pain control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggests sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection.
2. Right Hip Abscess: The patient's right hip abscess may become infected, leading to further complications and worsening of sepsis.
3. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient's chronic decubitus ulcers, especially with wound-vacs in place, can increase the risk of infection and delayed healing.
4. Paraplegia: The patient's paraplegia can lead to complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Chronic Pain: The patient's acute and chronic pain management is crucial to prevent complications related to immobility and stress.
6. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's nutrition status may be compromised due to his condition, which can impact wound healing and overall recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, a decubitus ulcer, pain control, and alteration in nutrition. They underwent surgery on the right hip with vacuum-assisted closure. The patient has multiple allergies, including to Motrin (Ibuprofen), aspirin, and unknown allergens. They received antibiotics such as Azithromycin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.

24-hour events include being transferred from the operating room and receiving antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/47 to 103/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5629 mL and output of 1690 mL, resulting in a balance of 3939 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of -4 mmHg. The patient is receiving phenylephrine infusion at 1.2 mcg/kg/min.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, platelet count of 546, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 100 mg/dL. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR of 15.0/30.6/1.3, lactic acid of 1.3 mmol/L, calcium of 7.1 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate of 2.2 mg/dL.

Assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, decubitus ulcer, pain control, and alteration in nutrition. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to organ dysfunction, progression of the decubitus ulcer, inadequate pain control, and malnutrition."

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   History reviewed. 58 yo ex-60 py smoker, paraplegic, decubitus ulcers,
   urostomy, ostomy, LUL T2N0 poorly diff adenoCA, multiple pneumothoraces
   s/p pleurodesis  admitted with septic shock from pelvic abscess.
   Presented [**4-19**] in septic shock initially with f/c/sob and productive
   cough of white sputum, light headiness, increased thirst and nausea.
   He was febrile and tachy at NH with BP 98/60, pulse up to 180 and
   received adenosine by EMS during transport to [**Hospital1 19**].  In ED, tachy and
   hypotensive.  T 101, P 150, BP 70/40  RR 17 100% NRB and room air.
   Left IJ CVL inserted, started on neosynephrine, and given 4 L IV
   fluids.  Abdomen tender though patient reports this is at baseline.
   Labs WBC 23 with 17% bands, Cr 1.3 lactate 4.7.  UA from suprapubic
   cath shows 21wbc and bacteria.  Cultures sent, pt given vanc 22:00
   /zosyn 23:00/azithro.  CT abd/pelvis shows a fluid collection with rim
   enhancement in the right pelvis. Drain was placed by IR with drainage
   of pus [**4-20**]. Gram stain shows 3+ polys with GNRs and GPCs in pairs and
   chains.
   Overnight/day events notable for: strep from abscess (and per micro the
   strep isolated in the BC) is now speciated as S anginosis.
   Sensitivities usually not run on this due to usually exquisite
   sensitivity to PCN.
   Exam as above. Awake, alert, oriented. Chest clear ant/lat, S1S2 reg,
   no murmurs, abd 2+ pitting LE edema.
   Labs, meds reviewed.
   Episode of SVT [**4-20**] with no recurrence. Labs significant for improving
   leukocytosis, creat. Still on pressors. Went to the OR yesterday for
   washout of pelvic abscess with 300 cc of additional pus drained.
   Remains on Vanc/Zosyn. Overall improving sepsis with continued shock,
   likely still septic. Respiratory status acceptable with good sats but
   concern for volume overload (LOS ~ 15 L positive including ED fluids).
   Management of strep mileri was reviewed. It is unusual for small colony
   S mileri to cause endocarditis (but micro not able to tell us small vs
   large). It is indicated to obtain an echo to r/o endocarditis -
   ordered. We also decided to give a dose of Gent for synergy given
   persistent shock. Cortisol 11
 will check ACTH stim test.
   Rest of the plan as outlined above in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7173**]

   critically ill. Total time 35 minutes. Full code.

","The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic male with decubitus ulcers who presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. He has a history of colon cancer and has undergone multiple surgeries. He is currently in the ICU for septic shock caused by a pelvic abscess. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), a heart rate of 77 bpm, a blood pressure of 92/47 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is -4 mmHg, indicating low blood volume. 

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and low-dose pressors to manage his blood pressure. He underwent surgical intervention to clean out the pelvic abscess and received intravenous fluids. 

His lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL. His blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in chains and gram-negative rods. 

The patient's past medical history includes paraplegia, decubitus ulcers, a colostomy/urostomy, and a history of lung cancer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with multiple medical conditions, including decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to a right hip abscess. He is currently receiving low-dose pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains at risk for further complications due to his underlying medical conditions and the presence of hardware in the right anterior groin area.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, and there is a risk of progression to multi-organ failure if not adequately managed.
2. Infection of hardware: The presence of hardware in the right anterior groin area increases the risk of infection, which could lead to further complications.
3. Decubitus ulcerations: The patient's chronic decubitus ulcers are at risk of worsening, especially if not properly managed with wound care nursing consult and surgical follow-up.
4. Paraplegia: The patient's paraplegia may contribute to complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's GERD requires ongoing management with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent complications such as"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of back pain. The patient has a growing infection caused by strep agninosus (strep milleri group) in the thigh fluid and blood. The patient has been treated with gentamicin and vancomycin, with therapeutic vancomycin trough levels at 19.

The patient also has mild mitral regurgitation without discrete vegetation on echocardiogram, but further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended due to clinical suspicion of endocarditis. 

The patient's cortisol levels are equivocal, and a stimulation test was performed with an increase from 9 to 19.9. The patient's TSH level is within normal range, and fT4 level is slightly low.

Plastics' assessment reveals a sacral decubitus ulcer that communicates with an area of thigh abscess, indicating osteomyelitis. The plastics team recommends IV antibiotics for 6 weeks and vacuum-assisted closure (Vac) changes every 3-4 days. Ortho also recommends washout of the abscess and possibly Vac change on Friday.

The patient has a history of allergies to ivy's dye, iodine-containing substances, Motrin (ibuprofen), aspirin, and unknown allergies to gentamicin and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from"

","The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. He has a source of infection in his right hip wound, which is growing Streptococcus anginosus (Strep Miller group). He has been treated with vancomycin, gentamicin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Despite these treatments, he remains in septic shock and is unable to wean off pressors.

The patient underwent a washout in the operating room, but there are plans for a repeat washout tomorrow. His TTE showed no vegetation, but the study was suboptimal. The source of infection seems to be controlled, but he may still have inadequate antibiotic therapy as sensitivities are still pending. Another possible etiology for his inability to come off pressors is adrenal insufficiency, which has been ruled out with cortisol levels and [Last Name (un) 402] stim being normal.

The patient's TSH is also normal, ruling out thyroid insufficiency. He is making a lot of urine, which raises the question of post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis, potentially causing intravascular volume depletion.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with multiple medical conditions, including decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, septic hip joint, and sepsis. He presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggesting septic shock. The patient has a right anterior groin collection, which was cleaned out in the operating room on [**4-22**]. He also has chronic decubitus ulcerations with wound-Vacs in place. The patient's current medications include vanc, Zosyn, asorbic acid/zinc/vit A, azithro, Colace, PPI, tricor, oxycodone, folic acid, iron, MVI, and lovenox. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but he requires low-dose pressors. His blood cultures are negative, and he has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to a suspected right hip abscess. This condition can lead to septic shock if not managed properly.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is still requiring low-dose pressors, indicating persistent hypotension despite improvement. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are crucial"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic male who was admitted with a septic hip joint on the right side. He has a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The source of sepsis is suspected to be a right hip abscess. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and is currently receiving low-dose pressors for hemodynamic support. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) have been initiated, and blood cultures have been obtained. Serial blood cultures have been negative so far.

The patient also has right anterior groin collection that was cleaned out in the operating room on 04/22. Decubitus ulcerations are present and being managed with wound care nursing consult and surgery follow-up. The patient's paraplegia is ongoing, and he is continuing on home medications including Lovenox, OxyContin, Percocet/Tylenol, Ativan, and vitamins. A nutrition consult has been requested.

The patient has a history of GERD, which is being managed with home PPI and PRN antacid. He also has hyperlipidemia (HL) managed with home Tricorn. His INR is elevated, and he may require vitamin K supplementation. His Hct is trending down due to blood loss from the wound"

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   History reviewed. 58 yo ex-60 py smoker, paraplegic, decubitus ulcers,
   urostomy, ostomy, LUL T2N0 poorly diff adenoCA, multiple pneumothoraces
   s/p pleurodesis  admitted with septic shock likely from pelvic abscess.
   CT abd/pelvis showed a 6 cm in diameter fluid collection with rim
   enhancement in the right pelvis. Drain was placed by IR with drainage
   of pus [**4-20**]. Gram stain shows 3+ polys with GNRs and GPCs in pairs and
   chains, grew S mileri sensitive to PCN.
   Episode of SVT [**4-20**] with no recurrence. Labs significant for improving
   leukocytosis, creat. Still on pressors. Went to the OR [**4-21**] for washout
   of pelvic abscess with 300 cc of additional pus drained.
   Overnight/day events notable for: TTE limited views but normal
   biventricular function, no vegetations seen. ACTH stim test showed
   cortisol increase from 11 to 20. Pt was seen by plastics
 high
   suspicion for osteo. TSH 1.5.
   Exam as above. Awake, alert, oriented. Chest clear ant/lat, S1S2 reg,
   no audible murmurs, abd 2+ pitting LE edema.
   Labs, meds reviewed. LOS positive 9.2 L.
   IMP: ongoing shock, at this point more likely hypovolemic given 3 days
   of appropriate antibiotic coverage and high urine output/low CVP.
   Will first hydrate with IVF. If hypotension persists, will likely add
   stress dose steroids, possibly switch pressor to Vasopressin. Remains
   on Vanc/Zosyn. Respiratory status acceptable with good sats but concern
   for volume overload.
   ID
s input is appreciated. Will likely require 6 week course of
   Ceftriaxone /Flagyl once discharged. He will also need to be reassessed
   for skin flap.
   Rest of the plan as outlined above in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7173**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male paraplegic with multiple medical issues, including a history of smoking, decubitus ulcers, urostomy, ostomy, and colon cancer. He was admitted with septic shock likely caused by a pelvic abscess. The patient underwent surgical washout of the abscess, and additional pus was drained. He continues to be on pressors and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition. It is crucial to monitor his vital signs closely and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Hypovolemic Shock: Given the patient's ongoing hypotension despite appropriate antibiotic coverage, there is a concern for hypovolemic shock. The attending physician plans to hydrate the patient with intravenous fluids and may add stress dose steroids or switch the pressor to Vasopressin if necessary.
3. Osteomyelitis: The presence of gram-negative rods in the abscess suggests a possible polymicrobial infection, including osteomyelitis. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but the attending physician seeks input from ID regarding an optimal antibiotic regimen for polymicrobial osteomyelitis.
4. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has chronic decubitus ulcers, which require ongoing wound care nursing consultation. Surgical intervention is planned for tomorrow to address these ulcers.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male paraplegic with decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, presenting with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with septic hip joint on the right side and is suspected to have developed septic shock. The source of the sepsis is believed to be a right hip abscess. The patient is currently receiving low-dose pressors to maintain blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension, fever, and tachycardia indicate ongoing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Polymicrobial hip abscess and osteomyelitis: The presence of a hip abscess and positive cultures for Strep and gram-negative rods suggest a polymicrobial infection. If not adequately treated, this can lead to persistent infection and potentially spread to other parts of the body.
3. Decubitus ulcerations: Chronic pressure ulcers can become infected and complicated by osteomyelitis. Proper wound care and management are crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Paraplegia: The patient's existing paraplegia increases the risk of pressure ulcers and other complications related to immobility. Regular turning and positioning, as well as appropriate pain management, are important to prevent worsening of the condition.

Overall, the patient's current condition presents several"

 Ongoing septic shock, unable to wean from pressors
   although dose is [**Month (only) **], Svo2 87 c/w poor perfusion. No further fevers and
   WBC is [**Month (only) **] which does suggest some improvement. Patient has been
   mentating well. Did appear to have reduced GFR which has now improved.
   Source is right hip wound growing strep arginosus and secondary
   bacteremia in [**1-26**] on admission. Bacteremia has cleared. TTE showed no
   vegetation but poor study. Pt is s/p washout in OR but there are plans
   for repeat washout tomorrow. It is concerning that the patient has
   still not been able to come of pressors. Etiologies include inadequate
   abx, inadequate source control with ongoing bacteremia, adrenal
   insuficiency. Inadequate abx is still possible as sensitivities are
   still being done; however, Vanc levels are adequate and strep milleri
   group should be sensitive to PCN and Vanc. The patient was given one
   dose of gent.  Inadequate source control seems unlikely as pt has had
   wash out, has wound vacs in place and as there is no vegetation on echo
   to suggest ongoing endovascular sourse
 may consider TEE but
   endocarditis is rare in strep milleri particularly with small colony
   strep ( which is what the patient
s presentation is most c/w).
   Cortisol levels have been checked as well as [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim and is nl r/o

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. The source of infection is identified as a right hip wound growing Streptococcus anginosus group, and secondary bacteremia on admission. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and has undergone surgical washouts. Despite these interventions, the patient remains on vasopressor support and is unable to wean off, suggesting ongoing septic shock. There are concerns about inadequate antibiotic therapy and inadequate source control with ongoing bacteremia, as well as adrenal insufficiency. Other potential complications include post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Inadequate Antibiotic Therapy: The patient may not be receiving the appropriate or sufficient antibiotic therapy to effectively treat the underlying infection.
2. Inadequate Source Control: Despite surgical washouts and wound management, there may still be an ongoing source of infection that needs to be addressed.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's persistent hypotension and requirement for vasopressors raise the possibility of adrenal insufficiency, which needs to be ruled out and managed accordingly.
4. Post-Acute Tubular Necrosis Diuresis: The patient's production of a large amount of urine raises the question of whether he is experiencing post-"

   58-yo paraplegic man with decubitus ulcers with Vac drains, colostomy /

 Ongoing septic shock, unable to wean from pressors
   although dose is [**Month (only) **], Svo2 87 c/w poor perfusion. No further fevers and
   WBC is [**Month (only) **] which does suggest some improvement. Patient has been
   mentating well. Did appear to have reduced GFR which has now improved.
   Source is right hip wound growing strep arginosus and secondary
   bacteremia in [**1-26**] on admission. Bacteremia has cleared. TTE showed no
   vegetation but poor study. Pt is s/p washout in OR but there are plans
   for repeat washout tomorrow. It is concerning that the patient has
   still not been able to come of pressors. Etiologies include inadequate
   abx, inadequate source control with ongoing bacteremia, adrenal
   insuficiency. Inadequate abx is still possible as sensitivities are
   still being done; however, Vanc levels are adequate and strep milleri
   group should be sensitive to PCN and Vanc. The patient was given one
   dose of gent.  Inadequate source control seems unlikely as pt has had
   wash out, has wound vacs in place and as there is no vegetation on echo
   to suggest ongoing endovascular sourse
 may consider TEE but
   endocarditis is rare in strep milleri particularly with small colony
   strep ( which is what the patient
s presentation is most c/w).
   Cortisol levels have been checked as well as [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim and is nl r/o

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. Some of these complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The source of infection was identified as a right hip wound growing Streptococcus anginosus (Milleri) group. Bacteremia has since cleared, but the patient is still experiencing septic shock and unable to wean off pressors.

2. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has chronic decubitus ulcers, which are pressure sores commonly seen in paraplegic individuals due to prolonged immobility. These ulcers are prone to infection and can lead to severe complications if not properly managed.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol levels were checked due to suspicion of adrenal insufficiency as a possible cause for inadequate response to antibiotics. However, the results were normal.

4. Endocarditis: Although the patient's echocardiogram showed no vegetation, there is still a concern for endocarditis, especially since the patient has been experiencing ongoing bacteremia. This may require further investigation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

5. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's high urine output raises the question of post-ATN diuresis. If confirmed, this could contribute to the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with multiple comorbidities, including decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He has a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis secondary to a right hip abscess caused by streptococcus and gram-negative rods. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment and low-dose pressors for septic shock. He also has chronic decubitus ulcers, paraplegia, GERD, hyperlipidemia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: The chronic nature of the patient's decubitus ulcers increases the risk of infection, delayed healing, and potential complications like osteomyelitis.
3. Paraplegia: The patient's paraplegia puts him at risk for pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and urinary tract infections (UTIs).
4. GERD: The patient's GERD can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia, esophagitis, and Barrett's esophagus if not managed properly.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The"

The patient's current condition includes fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, indicating possible septic shock. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening septic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest ongoing septic shock. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
2. Infection spread: The presence of a hip abscess indicates a localized infection. If not treated promptly and effectively, the infection may spread to other parts of the body, leading to additional complications.
3. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has chronic decubitus ulcers, which are prone to infection and can worsen if not properly managed. This may result in further complications such as deeper tissue damage or systemic infections.
4. Paraplegia: The patient's paraplegia puts him at risk for pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary complications due to immobility. These risks should be monitored and managed accordingly.

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   History reviewed. 58 yo ex-60 py smoker, paraplegic, decubitus ulcers,
   urostomy, ostomy, LUL T2N0 poorly diff adenoCA, multiple pneumothoraces
   s/p pleurodesis admitted with septic shock likely from pelvic abscess.
   CT abd/pelvis showed a 6 cm in diameter fluid collection with rim
   enhancement in the right pelvis. Drain was placed by IR with drainage
   of pus [**4-20**]. Gram stain shows 3+ polys with GNRs and GPCs in pairs and
   chains, grew S mileri sensitive to PCN.
   Episode of SVT [**4-20**] with no recurrence. Labs significant for improving
   leukocytosis, creat. Still on pressors. Went to the OR [**4-21**] for washout
   of pelvic abscess with 300 cc of additional pus drained, and washed out
   again today
 reportedly no pus.
   Overnight/day events notable for: washout in OR today, swab from wound
   and bone sent for culture.
   TTE [**4-23**] showed limited views but normal biventricular function, no
   vegetations seen. ACTH stim test showed cortisol increase from 11 to
   20.
   Exam unchanged. Awake, alert, oriented. Chest clear ant/lat, S1S2 reg,
   no audible murmurs, abd 2+ pitting LE edema.
   Labs, meds reviewed. Fluid balance 0.5 L positive.
   IMP: ongoing shock, at this point more likely hypovolemic given 4 days
   of appropriate antibiotic coverage and high urine output/low CVP
   yesterday, possibly adrenal insufficiency.
   Will continue to hydrate with IVF (keeping up with urine losses if
   possible), add HC 50 mg q6h. If hypotension persists, consider adding
   to Vasopressin. Remains on Vanc/Zosyn. Respiratory status acceptable
   with good sats but watch for volume overload.
   ID
s input appreciated. Will likely require 6 week course of
   Ceftriaxone /Flagyl once discharged. He will also eventually need to be
   reassessed for skin flap.
   Rest of the plan as outlined above in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7173**]
s note.
   Patient is critically ill. Total time 33 minutes. Full code.
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with multiple comorbidities including decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and a history of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis secondary to a right hip abscess. The abscess was identified as a 6 cm fluid collection with rim enhancement in the right pelvis, and pus was drained by interventional radiology.

The patient underwent an urgent operation for washout of the pelvic abscess, with an additional 300 cc of pus drained. Cultures were sent for gram stain and sensitivity testing. A swab from the wound and bone was also sent for culture.

The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring pressor support. The attending physician suspects ongoing shock, which is now more likely hypovolemic due to four days of appropriate antibiotic coverage and high urine output/low central venous pressure (CVP) yesterday. There is a possibility of adrenal insufficiency, as suggested by an ACTH stim test showing cortisol increase from 11 to 20.

The plan moving forward includes aggressive hydration with intravenous fluids, adding hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours, and considering the addition of vasopressin if hypotension persists. The patient will continue on van"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with multiple medical conditions including decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and a right hip abscess. He presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The patient has received various medications including antibiotics, fluids, and hydrocortisone. His vital signs have improved but he remains hypotensive and requires low-dose pressors.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. His electrolytes show a slightly low magnesium level and normal calcium and phosphorus levels. The patient also has a positive blood culture for streptococcus, indicating an infection.

The patient's medical complications may include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are consistent with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. The right hip abscess is suspected to be the source of sepsis.

2. Septic shock: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation suggests septic shock, which is a severe complication of sepsis characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a weight of 200 pounds. They are currently in the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction, a decubitus ulcer, acute and chronic pain, and alteration in nutrition. The patient has been receiving various medications including phenylephrine, enoxaparin (Lovenox), omeprazole (Prilosec), and others. Their vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/53 to 120/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings of 100, 88, 131, and 91 mg/dL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, along with normal hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. The patient has a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg and a fluid balance of +483 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   58-yo paraplegic man with decubitus ulcers with Vac drains, colostomy /
   urostomy, who presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, c/w
   sepsis.
   #. Septic shock
 Ongoing septic shock, unable to wean from pressors
   although dose is [**Month (only) **], Svo2 87 c/w poor perfusion. No further fevers and
   WBC is [**Month (only) **] which does suggest some improvement. Patient has been
   mentating well. Did appear to have reduced GFR which has now improved.
   Source is right hip wound growing strep arginosus and secondary
   bacteremia in [**1-26**] on admission. Bacteremia has cleared. TTE showed no
   vegetation but poor study. Pt is s/p washout in OR by Ortho. It is
   concerning that the patient has still not been able to come of
   pressors. Etiologies include inadequate abx, inadequate source control
   with ongoing bacteremia, adrenal insuficiency. Inadequate abx is still
   possible as sensitivities are still being done; however, Vanc levels
   are adequate and strep milleri group should be sensitive to PCN and
   Vanc. The patient was given one dose of gent.  Inadequate source
   control seems unlikely as pt has had wash out, has wound vacs in place
   and as there is no vegetation on echo to suggest ongoing endovascular
   sourse
 may consider TEE but endocarditis is rare in strep milleri
   particularly with small colony strep (which is what the patient
   presentation is most c/w).  Cortisol levels have been checked as well
   as [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim and is nl r/o adrenal insufficiency. TSH is also normal.
   Of note, patient is making a lot of urine
 200cc/hr- which raises the
   question if post-ATN diuresis is making him intravascularly dry.
   - cont vasopressor support for now
   - Per ID, will cont Vanc/Zosyn for now, but may transition to
   CTX/Flagyl if micro data does not grow out polymicrobes
   - f/u cx data
   - appreciate general surgery and orthopedics consults
   - follow serial labs including lactate, chemistries, blood gases
   - give a [**12-26**] day trial of hydrocort 50 Q6H to see if it helps with BP
   #. Right anterior groin collection
 Decubitous ulcer communicateds
   with groin collection per plastics. S/p wash out of purulent material
   in OR, fluid sent for analysis. Fluid showing probable poly-microbial
   collection. Now s/p 2nd washout w/ bone material sent for analysis
   - appreciate general surgery and orthopedics consults
   - f/u bone material analysis - infectious and pathology
   - since growing out strep, ID recommended MRI brain to rule out
   abscesses; however, no mental status changes
   # Anemia:
   - repeat HCT in PM, transfuse for Hg <7
   #. Decubitus ulcerations - Chronic, currently w/ wound-Vacs in place on
   two separate ulcers.
   - appreciate plastics involvement
   - wound care nursing consult
   - contine to monitor for signs of infection
   - would likely be adequately covered with broad-spectrums
   #. Productive cough - Symptoms are likely upper respiratory in origin,
   and clear exam and CXR is consistent.
   - cont home Albuterol nebs PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. He has been diagnosed with septic shock and is unable to wean from pressors. The source of infection is his right hip wound, which is infected with Streptococcus arginosus. The patient underwent a washout procedure in the operating room and has wound VACs in place. Despite these measures, the patient remains on vasopressor support and has poor perfusion. Other medical issues include anemia, chronic decubitus ulcers, productive cough, abdominal pain, paraplegia, GERD, hyperlipidemia, and communication difficulties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Inadequate antibiotic therapy: The patient may develop resistance to the current antibiotics being used if the causative organism is not fully sensitive to them.
2. Inadequate source control: If the infected wound is not properly managed, there is a risk of ongoing bacteremia and persistent sepsis.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol levels have been checked, but it is still possible that adrenal insufficiency could be contributing to his poor response to treatment.
4. Post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis: The patient's high urine output raises the"

   bacteremia in [**1-26**] on admission. Bacteremia has cleared. TTE showed no
   vegetation but poor study. Pt is s/p washout in OR by Ortho. It is
   concerning that the patient has still not been able to come of
   pressors. Etiologies include inadequate abx, inadequate source control
   with ongoing bacteremia, adrenal insuficiency. Inadequate abx is still
   possible as sensitivities are still being done; however, Vanc levels
   are adequate and strep milleri group should be sensitive to PCN and
   Vanc. The patient was given one dose of gent.  Inadequate source
   control seems unlikely as pt has had wash out, has wound vacs in place
   and as there is no vegetation on echo to suggest ongoing endovascular

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and has not been able to wean from pressors. The source of infection is identified as the right hip wound, which is infected with Streptococcus arginosus and caused secondary bacteremia. The bacteremia has cleared after surgical washout in the operating room.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Inadequate antibiotic therapy: Despite adequate levels of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, the patient still shows signs of septic shock. It is possible that the antibiotics may not be effectively targeting the infection.

2. Inadequate source control: Although the patient has undergone surgical washout and has wound VACs in place, there is a concern for ongoing bacteremia. This could indicate inadequate source control.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol levels have been checked, and stim is normal, ruling out adrenal insufficiency. However, this will need to be monitored further.

4. Endovascular source: The absence of vegetation on the echocardiogram suggests that there is no ongoing endovascular source of infection. However, the possibility of considering transesophageal"

   58-yo paraplegic man with decubitus ulcers with Vac drains, colostomy /
   urostomy, who presents with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, c/w
   sepsis.
   #. Septic shock
 Ongoing septic shock, unable to wean from pressors
   although dose is [**Month (only) **], Svo2 87 c/w poor perfusion. No further fevers and
   WBC is [**Month (only) **] which does suggest some improvement. Patient has been
   mentating well. Did appear to have reduced GFR which has now improved.
   Source is right hip wound growing strep arginosus and secondary
   bacteremia in [**1-26**] on admission. Bacteremia has cleared. TTE showed no
   vegetation but poor study. Pt is s/p washout in OR by Ortho. It is
   concerning that the patient has still not been able to come of
   pressors. Etiologies include inadequate abx, inadequate source control
   with ongoing bacteremia, adrenal insuficiency. Inadequate abx is still
   possible as sensitivities are still being done; however, Vanc levels
   are adequate and strep milleri group should be sensitive to PCN and
   Vanc. The patient was given one dose of gent.  Inadequate source
   control seems unlikely as pt has had wash out, has wound vacs in place
   and as there is no vegetation on echo to suggest ongoing endovascular
   sourse
 may consider TEE but endocarditis is rare in strep milleri
   particularly with small colony strep (which is what the patient
   presentation is most c/w).  Cortisol levels have been checked as well

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic male with decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, consistent with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and has not been able to wean from pressors. There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing symptoms suggest a persistent infection, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.

2. Septic shock: The patient's inability to wean from pressors and low Svo2 indicate poor perfusion, which may be due to septic shock.

3. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has chronic decubitus ulcers that require ongoing wound care management. These ulcers are prone to infection and can worsen if not properly managed.

4. Right hip wound infection: The source of sepsis identified in this patient is a right hip wound infection caused by Streptococcus arginosus. This infection needs to be treated appropriately to prevent further complications.

5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol levels have been checked, and it was ruled out as a cause for the persistent hypotension. However, this should still be monitored closely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with multiple medical issues, including decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and a history of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He was found to have a right hip abscess and is diagnosed with septic shock. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 104/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetrical chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slightly low sodium and magnesium levels. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive input of 3,795 mL and output of 4,250 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -455 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggests sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not promptly treated.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's condition has been labeled as septic shock, requiring low-dose vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. This indicates a severe response to infection, and close monitoring is necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with multiple comorbidities, including decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and septic shock. The source of sepsis was identified as a right hip wound infected with Streptococcus arginosus and secondary bacteremia. The patient underwent surgical washout of the wound and was treated with appropriate antibiotics. His condition improved, and he was weaned off pressors. However, he still has a low hemoglobin concentration (Hct 20) and is receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He also has chronic pain, anemia, decubitus ulcers, and other medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient had a severe infection leading to sepsis and septic shock. There is a risk of recurrence if proper infection control measures are not maintained.
2. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has chronic decubitus ulcers that require regular wound care and may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
3. Anemia: The patient's low Hct indicates anemia, which may be due to chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies, or blood loss. Monitoring of anemia labs is recommended.
4. Chronic pain: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man with a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and septic shock. He has since improved and is now off pressors for 12 hours. The patient's white blood cell count has improved, suggesting some improvement. The source of infection was identified as a right hip wound growing Strep arginosus with secondary bacteremia. The bacteremia has cleared, and the patient underwent a washout in the operating room by Ortho. A trial of stress-dose steroids has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis without organ dysfunction and septic shock. Although the patient has improved and is off pressors, there is still a risk of recurrent sepsis if the source of infection is not completely eradicated.
2. Decubitus Ulcerations: The patient has chronic decubitus ulcers that require ongoing wound care and monitoring for signs of infection.
3. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level (20.7%), indicating anemia. Further evaluation and possible transfusion may be necessary.
4. Chronic Pain: The patient experiences chronic pain, which needs to be managed effectively to improve his overall well-being.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction. They have a history of decubitus ulcer, pain control (acute and chronic pain), and alteration in nutrition. The patient was started on stress-dose steroids and had a slow wean off pressors, which were discontinued at 8 pm. They have a low Hct at 20 and have been ordered to receive 2 units of transfusion. The patient is currently on various medications including enoxaparin (Lovenox), antibiotics (Gentamicin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam), and other ICU medications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which indicates an ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing further infections due to the immunocompromised state caused by the sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient is on enoxaparin (Lovenox), which is an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots. This increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a total fluid input of 1,465 mL and total fluid output of 1,720 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -255 mL. This could indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or excessive fluid losses.
4. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old paraplegic man admitted to the ICU with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggestive of sepsis. He has a history of decubitus ulcers, colostomy/urostomy, and is currently being treated for a polymicrobial hip abscess. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 114/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His physical examination is unremarkable except for mild left shoulder pain. Lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.4 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL. The patient has received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and nutritional supplements. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is already diagnosed with a hip abscess and has a history of decubitus ulcers. There is a risk of further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy (LMW Heparin) to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which increases the risk of"

The patient has anemia, which is likely multifactorial including autoimmune cytopenia, surgical loss, and dilution. Two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) have been transfused.

The patient's paraplegia will be managed with continued low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox) and home medications including oxycodone (OxyContin), as needed Percocet/Tylenol, Ativan, and home vitamins (Vit B12, iron, folate, MVI). A nutrition consult is also requested.
