","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and recent admission for abdominal distension. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications including urinary tract infection (UTI), acute pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation (AF), hypoxemia, hypertension, and constipation. 

For the UTI, the plan is to continue vancomycin and zosyn, tailor as sensitivities become available, follow up with urine culture, and discontinue Foley catheter.

For the respiratory distress, the patient's history of aspiration and flash pulmonary edema needs to be considered. Initial chest X-ray showed evidence of left lower lobe process. The patient received vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency department (ED). B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) suggests congestive heart failure. A pulmonary toilet should be performed, and intravenous (IV) Lasix should be given for a goal of -2-3 liters.

Regarding the atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient is already on a beta-blocker and coumadin at baseline. He is currently off diltiazem and rate-controlled on home medications. The plan is to restart home beta-blocker, tit"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CVA, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), pulmonary embolism (PE), and recurrent aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient presents with urinary tract infection (UTI), hypertensive urgency, and AFib with RVR. The patient became volume overloaded with a witnessed aspiration event requiring 100% NRB mask.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has pulmonary edema due to diastolic dysfunction and aspiration PNA. There is also an element of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) given the initial lower left lobe opacity on chest X-ray.
   - Vanc/Cefepime: Administered antibiotics.
   - Diuresis: Administered to reduce fluid overload.
   - Nebulizers: To provide respiratory support.
   - Oxygen weaning: Will continue to reduce oxygen dependence as tolerated.

2. AFib with RVR:
   - Diuretics: Administered to manage fluid overload.
   - Beta-blocker titration: Will continue to adjust as tolerated.

3. UTI:
   - Cefepime: Administered antibiotic.
   - Follow-up cultures: To monitor the effectiveness of treatment.

4. History of PE:
   - Therapeutic on Coumadin: To prevent further thrombotic events.

5. GI issues:
   - Large amount of GI tract air: Fleet enema administered last night.
   - Bowel regimen: Continue with current bowel regimen.
   - ABD X-ray: Ordered to assess the abdomen.
   - Restart TF today: To ensure proper gastrointestinal function.

6. Reactive airway disease:
   - Nebulizers: Administered as needed.

7. Code status: DNR/DNI.

8. ICU care:
   - Nutrition: Glycemic control and Dexi checks.
   - Lines: 18 Gauge and 22 Gauge inserted.
   - Prophylaxis: DVT prevention with boots and Coumadin, stress ulcer prevention with H2 blocker, VAP prevention with head-of-bed elevation.

9. Disposition: Transfer to the floor later this afternoon if oxygen requirements are stable or decreasing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure, along with the presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray, suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema. This can lead to respiratory distress and further hypoxemia.

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings indicate the potential development of HAP. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent aspiration events put him at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's UTI requires prompt antibiotic treatment to prevent the progression of the infection. If left untreated, it can lead to systemic complications such as sepsis.

5. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's hypertensive urgency needs to be managed to prevent end-organ damage"

They presented with urinary tract infection, hypertensive urgency, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient became volume overloaded with a witnessed aspiration event requiring 100% NRB mask. They were diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely pulmonary edema due to diastolic dysfunction and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is also suspected to have hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), diltiazem, colace, senna, simethicone, Tylenol, allopurinol, lisinopril, bisacodyl, lansoprasole, lidocaine TD, citalopram, Coumadin, Reglan, Lopressor 50mg NG TID, and others.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/55 to 139/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 92%, and temperature at 37.2 degrees Celsius. The patient has atrial fibrillation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old individual with a history of CVA, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, pulmonary embolism, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. They present with urinary tract infection, hypertensive urgency, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient experienced volume overload and had a witnessed aspiration event requiring 100% NRB mask.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pulmonary edema due to diastolic dysfunction and aspiration pneumonia. There is also an element of hospital-acquired pneumonia given the initial left lower lobe opacity on the chest X-ray.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (Afib with RVR): The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR needs to be managed with diuretics and continuous titration of beta-blockers as tolerated.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is currently being treated with cefepime, and follow-up cultures are required.
4. Hypertension: The patient's antihypertensive medications are being held temporarily due to low blood pressure on diltiazem.
5. History of Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is receiving therapeutic doses of Coumadin.
6. Gastrointestinal (GI) Issues: The patient has a large amount of GI tract air, and a fleet enema was administered last night. The bowel regimen should"

The patient is an 84-year-old with a history of CVA, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, pulmonary embolism, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. They presented with urinary tract infection, hypertensive urgency, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient subsequently became volume overloaded with a witnessed aspiration event requiring 100% NRB mask. The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has pulmonary edema due to diastolic dysfunction and aspiration pneumonia. There is also an element of hospital-acquired pneumonia given the initial lower left lobe opacity on chest X-ray.
   - Treatment: Vanc/Cefepime, diuresis, nebulizers, wean O2 as tolerated.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:
   - Treatment: Diuretics, continue to titrate beta-blockers as tolerated.

3. Urinary tract infection: The patient is on cefepime and follow-up cultures are planned.
   - Treatment: Cefepime, follow-up cultures.

4. History of pulmonary embolism: Therapeutic on coumadin.
   - Treatment: Coumadin.

5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has a large amount of GI tract air, and a fleet enema was given last night. The bowel regimen should be continued, an abdominal X-ray is ordered, and tube feeding should be restarted today.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of chronic conditions such as cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (AF), pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and recent admission for abdominal distension. The patient presented with respiratory distress and was initially treated in the emergency department (ED) for flash pulmonary edema and possible pulmonary embolism. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (BNP > [**2181**]), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hemoconcentration, acute renal failure (ARF), urinary tract infection (UTI), and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter due to a previous PE.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of aspiration, flash pulmonary edema, and possible PE. The initial CXR showed evidence of left lower lobe process. The patient received vancomycin and zosyn in the ED. The patient must be closely monitored for any signs of worsening respiratory distress, and appropriate measures such as IV lasix for goal of 0L, rate control with beta-blocker, and continuation of empiric HAP coverage should be considered.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient is currently on a beta-blocker and coumadin at baseline. The patient was initially requiring dilt gtt and rate-controlled on home meds"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CVA, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), pulmonary embolism (PE), and recurrent aspiration pneumonia (PNA). He presents with urinary tract infection (UTI), hypertensive urgency, and AFib with RVR. The patient became volume overloaded with a witnessed aspiration event requiring 100% NRB mask. He has hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary edema and aspiration PNA, as well as an element of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient's AFib with RVR is stable, and beta-blockers (BB) are being titrated as tolerated. He is on cefepime for UTI and follow-up cultures are planned. His history of PE is being managed with therapeutic Coumadin, and a decrease in hematocrit from 36% to 27% has been observed with an INR of 6.0. Coumadin has been discontinued, and vitamin K is being considered for active bleeding, with serial hct's planned. The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with increased creatinine from 1.1 to 1.4. He is being monitored closely, and further evaluation of renal function will be done. The patient's feeding/gastrointestinal status includes continued bowel regimen, initiation of tube feeding (TF) today, and an increased sodium level of 153. Fluid restriction and fluid warmers have been started. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI and is not eligible for invasive procedures except for sedation/blood products/a line. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, 18-gauge and 22-gauge lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis with head-of-bed elevation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old individual with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), pulmonary embolism (PE), and recurrent aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient presented with urinary tract infection (UTI), hypertensive urgency, and Afib with RVR. They subsequently experienced volume overload and a witnessed aspiration event, requiring 100% non-rebreather mask.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema given diastolic dysfunction and aspiration PNA. There is also an element of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to initial lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray. The patient is currently receiving Vancomycin and Cefepime for now, but will transition to an oral regimen prior to transfer to rehabilitation.

The patient has been stabilized in low 100s with high-dose beta-blockers for Afib with RVR and will transition to diltiazem PO for better control. The patient is on Cefepime for UTI, with follow-up cultures planned. The patient has a history of PE and is therapeutically on Coumadin. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 36 to 27 during this admission, along with an INR of 6.0. There is no evidence of active bleeding. The patient will be discharged from Coumadin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old individual with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrent aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient presented with hypertensive urgency and atrial fibrillation with RVR. They subsequently became volume overloaded with a witnessed aspiration event requiring 100% NRB mask.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema given diastolic dysfunction and aspiration PNA, hypertensive urgency, atrial fibrillation with RVR, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently on therapeutic doses of Coumadin, which has resulted in a decreased hematocrit level and an increased INR.

The plan includes continuing the current medications, transitioning to an oral regimen prior to transfer to rehab, nebulizers for reactive airway disease, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, and transitioning from high-dose beta-blockers to diltiazem for better control of atrial fibrillation. For the urinary tract infection, the patient is currently on cefepime, and follow-up cultures will be done. 

Regarding the history of pulmonary embolism, the patient's therapeutic dose of Coumadin has decreased their hematocrit level and"
