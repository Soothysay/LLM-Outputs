   however the absence of any contrast limits this assessment. UA with few
   bacteria but no evidence of inflammation (leuk- no wbc).  He reports
   that the mild erythema of his lower extremities is chronic and
   unchanged making cellulitis less likely. In the ED, he complained of
   hip pains but patient says these are actually thigh pains

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and metastatic prostate cancer who was admitted to the ICU following a fever at his rehab facility. He has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and pulmonary edema. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Volume depletion: The patient is suspected to be volume depleted due to diuresis and diarrhea with fever, which could be a result of unresolved C. difficile colitis. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further volume depletion.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient's hypotension could be due to a decreased pump function possibly caused by myocardial infarction (MI). This is suggested by the presence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Further evaluation, such as a cardiac ultrasound and serial troponin levels, should be done to assess cardiac function.

3. Abdominal infection: The patient has abdominal tenderness, but abdominal imaging is benign. He has been empirically covered with Flagyl for suspected C. difficile colitis. Repeating urine and blood cultures and a C. difficile toxin assay are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.

4. Thigh pain: The patient complains of hip pains, but they are actually thigh pains. Worsening pain may indicate a hip pathology, and a hip MRI should be considered.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a slightly elevated INR, which suggests a co"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and metastatic prostate cancer who was admitted to the ICU due to fever at his rehab facility. He has a preexisting condition of ESRD (end-stage renal disease) post cadaveric renal transplant. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 93/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics (Flagyl, vancomycin, and zosyn), methylprednisolone, allopurinol, fluoxetine, neurontin, insulin, ferrous sulfate, and protonix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume depletion: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and diuresis suggest that he may be volume depleted. This could be due to unresolved C. difficile colitis, as indicated by his recent diarrhea.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, which could be a result of decreased cardiac pump function possibly caused by an MI (myocardial infarction).
3. Abdominal tenderness: The patient has some abdominal tenderness, but abdominal imaging is benign. However, the absence of contrast limits this assessment.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and metastatic prostate cancer. He was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a background of c. difficile infection, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-cadaveric renal transplant, and is currently on immunosuppression. He also has hypocalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis without organ dysfunction. This condition can lead to organ failure and increased mortality if not managed appropriately.

2. Renal Failure: As the patient has a history of ESRD and is on immunosuppression post renal transplant, there is a risk of renal function deterioration. Close monitoring of renal parameters is necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium levels can be associated with various complications such as muscle cramps, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias. Calcium supplementation and correction of underlying causes should be considered.

4. Infection Control: Given the patient's history of c. difficile infection, it is crucial to maintain strict infection control measures to prevent the spread of infection within the ICU.

5. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressed state increases the risk of opportunistic infections and potential complications related to the underlying malignancy.

6. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
 Fever and hypotension
   Suspect volume depleted in setting of diuresis and diarrhea with fever
   due to unresolved C. difficile colitis. No clear focus of infection on
   imaging of torso or lower extremities.  He does have some abdominal
   tenderness but abdominal imaging benign; however the absence of any
   contrast limits this assessment. UA with few bacteria but no evidence
   of inflammation (leuk- no wbc).  He reports that the mild erythema of
   his lower extremities is chronic and unchanged making cellulitis less
   likely. In the ED, he complained of hip pains but patient says these
   are actually thigh pains
 if worsening pain consider hip MRI.
   --Cover with flagyl empirically for now. Received vancomycin, zosyn,
   flagyl in the emergency room.
   --Repeat urine and blood cultures. C diff toxin assay resent as initial
   information was that this had been negative recently.
   --Outline areas of erythema on legs, follow
   --Check amylase/lipase though suspect pancreatitis is less likely
   --Will fluid resuscitate with lactated ringers for goal central venous
   pressure 8 to 12 mmHg, MAP 65 mmHg, and UOP 0.5 mL/kg per hour. Add
   levophed if needed for BP support following fluid resuscitation.
   Continue stress dose steroids covering with insulin sliding scale and
   PPI. INR slightly elevated but
 Leg pains
   No evidence of soft tissue gas worrisome for necrotizing fasciitis. No
   lytic lesions seen on CT.  Perfusion of LE appears adequate on clinical
   exam. CK normal arguing against myositis/rhabdomyolysis. Patient does
   have history of multiple body aches from past discharge summaries.
   --Follow for now with pain control.
 Hyperchloremic non-gap metabolic acidosis.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be [**3-15**] volume loss from recent c. difficile diarrheal infection.
   Also could be [**3-15**] renal failure.
   --Will replete fluids with LR, follow electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
 ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant.
   --Hold tacrolimus per transplant nephrology, check level in AM
   --Graft ultrasound given elevation in Cr. Can check urine electrolytes,
   eosinophils
 Hypocalcemia. Calcium quite low at admission, corrects to 7.1 using
   albumin of 2.4 from [**2138-2-24**]. Review of medications shows that he had
   been on calcitriol previously. Apparently this was stopped in setting
   of elevated calcium.
   --Replete calcium per nephrology recommendations, consider restarting
   calcitrol at lower dose with close monitoring.
   --Follow Ca-Phos product while repleting
 Elevated troponin
   --Troponin decreasing on repeat. ACS unlikely.
 ?Conjunctivitis. Unilateral crusting suggests possible mild bacterial
   conjunctivitis, will treat with topical erythromycin.
 ?Coagulopathy
   INR slightly elevated at 1.5 at admission, improved to 1.3 on repeat.
   Fibrinogen WNL without evidence of active bleeding. Follow Hct and INR

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and metastatic prostate cancer. He was admitted with fever and hypotension, suspecting volume depletion due to diuresis and diarrhea caused by unresolved C. difficile colitis. There is no clear focus of infection on imaging, but he has abdominal tenderness. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a few bacteria in his urine without evidence of inflammation. He reports mild erythema in his lower extremities, which is chronic and unchanged, making cellulitis less likely. The patient complains of hip pain, but it is actually thigh pain, so a hip MRI is considered if the pain worsens. The patient is covered with flagyl empirically, and repeat urine and blood cultures, as well as a C. diff toxin assay, are planned.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium, along with low levels of hemoglobin, platelets, and albumin. His blood glucose level is also elevated. The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, which could be due to volume loss from recent C. difficile diarrheal infection or renal failure. Fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers is planned to achieve central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-12 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg, and urine output (UOP) at 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Levophed will be added if needed for BP support after fluid resuscitation.

The patient's calcium level is low but corrects to 7.1 using albumin. He had been on calcitriol previously but stopped due to elevated calcium levels. Calcium repletion is planned per nephrology recommendations, and calcitriol may be restarted at a lower dose with close monitoring.

The patient's troponin level is elevated but decreasing on repeat, making acute coronary syndrome (ACS) unlikely. A conjunctivitis is suspected, and topical erythromycin will be used for treatment. The patient's coagulopathy is improving, with an INR slightly elevated at admission but improving to 1.3 on repeat.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume depletion due to unresolved C. difficile colitis
2. Possible necrotizing fasciitis in the lower extremities
3. Renal failure
4. Hyperchloremic non-gap metabolic acidosis
5. Hypocalcemia
6. Elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial injury (decreasing on repeat)
7. Conjunctivitis
8. Coagulopathy

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION - suspect this is multifactorial - AI, poor ventricular
   fxn, peripheral fistula. Very difficult to assess his perfusion as he
   seems to have had a renal insult and his MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 294**] somewhat
   delerious.  Would be inclined to tolerate BPs of 80s as long as he does
   not have changes suggestive of poor perfusion. He is total about 10L
   pos LOS. Exam and CXR show pulmonary edema.  Will ask for cardiology
   input about managing his CHF and volume with low BP
   No clear source
 DIARRHEA
   [**3-15**] c. difficile infection
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD) - UO is now
   minimal. Will need dialysis in next few days but BP may mandate CVVH
   s/p cadaveric renal transplant on immunosuppression
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   hypocalcemia
   He seems to be slowly deteriorating. I see little that is truly
   reversible here. I suspect his cardiac disease is a major part of this.
   He is heading to dialysis but has indicated he will refuse going back
   on HD. We will discuss long term plan/prognosis with his wife

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 89/62 mmHg to 107/77 mmHg. This could be due to poor ventricular function, peripheral fistula, or other factors.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient exhibits signs of pulmonary edema, as indicated by crackles in the lung fields and a chest X-ray. This may be a result of congestive heart failure (CHF) and fluid overload.

3. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of c. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and contribute to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD): The patient's urine output is declining, indicating a worsening renal function. This requires dialysis support, but the patient has expressed refusal to go back on hemodialysis (HD). The patient is also scheduled for a renal transplant.

5. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient shows hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, which may require careful monitoring and management.

6. Cardiac disease: The patient's cardiac function appears to be compromised, leading to tachycardia and potential heart failure. Cardiology input is needed for managing CHF and volume status with low blood pressure.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male who has undergone a cadaveric renal transplant and is currently experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction, diarrhea, renal failure (end stage), electrolyte and fluid disorder, and pulmonary edema. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metastatic prostate cancer. 

The patient presented with subjective fevers from rehab and hypotension, along with acute-on-chronic renal failure. The cause of the acute worsening is unclear. The patient is oliguric and anuric since admission, with hypotension of unclear etiology as no localization of possible infection has been found. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%, although it may underestimate the true EF. 

The patient's temperature has been afebrile since admission. Initially, the white blood cell count was elevated but has now normalized. The patient is being treated empirically for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection due to the history of recent antibiotic use. Surveillance cultures are pending, and the C. diff toxin is negative. The patient is on Flagyl, Zosyn, and Vancomycin, and the Vancomycin dose will be adjusted based on the levels. 

The hypotension is unclear in etiology, as no source of infection has been identified. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, which has resulted in a normalized WBC count. The patient's low EF"

   TTE [**3-18**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
   The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There
   is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
   the basal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the more distal segments.
   There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40%). The
   estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Mild to moderate
   ([**2-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is very mild
   mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is high normal. There is a very small anterior pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderate aortic stenosis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-10-1**], regional
   left ventricular systolic function is more prominent (but was suggested
   on the prior study) and the severity of aortic regurgitation has
   increased. The severity of aortic stenosis is likely similar.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who underwent a renal transplant in 2015. He presented to the hospital with subjective fevers, hypotension, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is experiencing fever and hypotension of unclear etiology.
- He is oliguric and has acute-on-chronic renal failure.
- There is concern for sepsis without organ dysfunction or hypotension.
- The patient has a history of metastatic prostate cancer and is currently being treated with Lupron.
- He also has a history of PCKD and a cardiac component given AS (aortic stenosis) and worsened AI (aortic insufficiency).
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is reported as 40%, with concern for a lower EF in the setting of worsening AR (aortic regurgitation).
- The patient has been positive for length of stay with pulmonary edema, which is likely due to a cardiac component.
- The patient's electrolytes show hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and slightly elevated potassium.
- The patient is on immunosuppression post renal transplant and requires aggressive hydration.
- He is currently being treated empirically for C. diff, as per history.
- The patient's renal function is worsening, and he will need HD (hemodialysis) in"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Precipitating factor likey
   Pseudomonal UTI, covered on Zosyn since admission.  Rising Cr of 5.2
   (from 4.5), K+ stable at 5.2, oliguric, 10cc of urine since last night,
   mental status markedly improved from admission.
   -Continue Zosyn and Vacomycin for broad coverage for a total of 7 days
   -Dialysis today
   -Continue to check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   2.  Fever/Hypotension:  Likely secondary to pseudomonal UTI, have not
   been able to localize any other infection, blood cultures negative to
   date.  BP's have been in low 100's which represents an improvement from
   admission.  Has not required pressors or fluid bolus for >48 hours.
   -Close monitoring of BP's as being dialyzed today
   -Would tolerate SBP to the 80's, if drops below, would bolus cautiously
   with NS with bicarb and avoid LR due to K+ content
   -Would also consider pressor use if BP's do not respond to bolus as
   patient has significant pulmonary edema
   -Nutritional status may also be contributing to low blood pressures,
   nutrition consult recommended tube feeds, will hold off until discuss
   plan with wife
   -D/c stress dose steriods as BP's adequate
   -Continue Zosyn, Vancomycin and Flagyl
   -Dose Vancomycin by level, holding today's dose for level of 30.1
   3.  Pulmonary Edema:  Worsened on CXR from yesterday, no subjective
   dyspnea.  No crackles heard on anterior exam as fluid is dependant.
   Cause is multifactorial including pseudomonal UTI likely resulting in
   sepsis, poor nutritional status, low EF of 40% and aortic stenosis.
   -patient is overall volume overloaded, but likely intravascularly dry
   because of low hydrostatic and low oncotic pressure
   -appreciate cardiology consult who recommends improving nutritional
   status and sepsis as heart failure component likely secondary to these
   primary problems
   -HD today
   -Repeat CXR in am
   4. ESRD:  S/p B renal transplant, on tacrolimus and steriods
   -tacrolimus level 5.1 today, will dose 1mg [**Hospital1 **] per renal and monitor
   levels, hold for level >6
   -will change steriods to baseline dose of 10mg qday
   5.  Pseudomonal UTI:  On Zosyn x7d course, mental status improved
   6.  Prostate Cancer:  On Lupron

   Intern Addendum
   Agree with above note. BPs somewhat improved today but essentially
   anuric. CXR shows pulmonary edema
 suspect that his AS is
   contributing. Plan for HD today, starting tacrolimus per renal
   recommendations. Unclear if he indeed has a UTI versus bacteruria but
   in this immunosuppressed patient without other source of fevers that
   brought him in will treat.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of failing renal transplants, presenting with recent Clostridium difficile colitis and admitted with fever. The patient has confirmed DNR/DNI status, and his wife prefers to defer the decision about dialysis until they can discuss it with the patient's primary doctor.

The patient has been experiencing symptoms including generalized discomfort in bed, no dyspnea, no nausea or emesis, and no pruritis. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate 101 bpm, blood pressure 95/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals alertness, orientation to person, place, month, and year, talkative, and moderate pain while moving. He also has dry mucous membranes and cracked lips, tachycardia with III/VI SEM heard best at apex, no crackles heard anteriorly, diffusely tender abdomen with worse tenderness on left side, ostomy site pink and draining clear yellow urine, no increased tenderness around the site, warm lower extremities with 2+ pitting edema, and multiple tophi on fingers, hands, arms, fistula with palpable thrill on right arm.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of renal failure and hypotension. They have been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, diarrhea due to a previous c. difficile infection, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), pulmonary edema with an unclear etiology, and electrolyte & fluid disorder including hypocalcemia. The patient has undergone a cadaveric renal transplant and is on immunosuppression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates a systemic infection that can lead to organ failure if not properly managed.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's recent c. difficile infection increases the risk of recurrent episodes of diarrhea, which can further compromise their overall health and fluid balance.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suggests a severe and irreversible decline in kidney function, leading to decreased urine output and the need for dialysis. Complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances may arise due to renal dysfunction.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema, characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's hypocalcemia indicates a low level of calcium in the blood, which can affect various bodily functions including nerve and muscle function. It is important to monitor and manage electrolyte levels carefully.
6. Infection Risk: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state post renal transplant, they are at increased risk for infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are crucial.
7. Complications from Dialysis: Initiating dialysis in a patient with almost anuric status (extremely low urine output) may have complications such as hypotension, fluid shifts, and access site infections.
8. Cardiovascular Function: The unclear etiology of pulmonary edema raises concerns about the patient's cardiac function. Further evaluation and management are necessary to assess and stabilize cardiovascular health.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and prompt management to ensure the patient's well-being in the ICU setting."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, diarrhea (previously diagnosed with c. difficile infection), renal failure (undergoing immunosuppression post-cadaveric renal transplant), pulmonary edema, and electrolyte & fluid disorder. 

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/66 mmHg to 105/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral chest, warm skin, and muscle wasting. Neurological assessment is not fully assessed due to the patient's inability to stand or move. 

Laboratory results indicate low hemoglobin, high leukocyte count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's current plan includes a 7-day course of antibiotics, close monitoring of renal function, and ongoing management of pulmonary edema. The patient is also on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiac function, persistent pulmonary edema, electrolyte imbalances, and infection due to immunosuppression. It is important to monitor the patient's fluid balance, renal function, and cardiac status closely."
