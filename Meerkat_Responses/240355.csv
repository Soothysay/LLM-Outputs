 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   54 yo F with mental retardation transferred from an outside hospital
   who presents with mental status changes and fever, found to be
   fluid-responsive hypotensive in th ER.
   1. Fever/mental status changes: The patient at baseline has severe
   mental retardation and would likely be susceptible to any delirium
   regardless of the source.  With the leukocytosis, the patient likely
   has an infection.  The urine analysis at the outside hospital was
   weakly positive and may represent a mild urinary tract infection.
   However given the patient
s significnat mental status changes it is
   concerning that there may be additional source of infection.  There are
   no signs of nucal rigidity currently and the patient has had signficant
   improvement after vancomycin and ceftriaxone.  With the history of
   increased hydrocephalus the patient could have dysfunction of the v-v
   shunt or infection.
   - neurosurgical evaluation, await reccomendations regarding
   hydrocephalus
   - follow up urinalysis
   - bactrim po for now
   - [**Month (only) 51**] do LP today if patient will tolerate given that the patient had
   mental status chages and fever
   2. Hypotension: Now resolved.  The patient was hypotensive that was
   fluid resposive and now normotensive.  Will follow blood pressures and
   bolus as needed.
   3. Hydrocephalus:  The patient is currently asymptomatic but with
   signficant hydrocephalus on CT at osh.
   - await neurosurgical evaluation regarding shunt function
   4. Bowel distension:  Likely with constipation.  Will treat with bowel
   meds.
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient is currently in normal sinus
   rhythm.  Will restart aspirin when no longer has potential for shunt
   evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with mental retardation who was transferred from an outside hospital due to mental status changes and fever. She presented with severe mental retardation and would likely be susceptible to any delirium regardless of the source. The patient's leukocytosis suggests an infection, and the urine analysis at the outside hospital was weakly positive, possibly indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, given the significant mental status changes, there is concern for an additional source of infection. The patient's fever and mental status changes have improved after receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone. It is also noted that the patient has had significant improvement after intraventricular drain insertion. The patient's hypotension was initially fluid-responsive but has now resolved. She is currently asymptomatic but has significant hydrocephalus on CT at OSH. The patient's bowel distension is likely due to constipation, and she will be treated with bowel medications. The patient was previously in atrial fibrillation but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. She will restart aspirin when no longer at risk for shunt evaluation. The patient has hypothyroidism and will continue on home medications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with mental retardation who was transferred from an outside hospital due to mental status changes and fever. She presented with severe mental retardation and was found to be fluid-responsive hypotensive in the ER. The patient had a weakly positive urine analysis for infection at the outside hospital, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. However, there were no signs of nucal rigidity, and the patient showed significant improvement after receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The patient's history of increased hydrocephalus raised concerns about dysfunction or infection related to her v-v shunt. A CT scan revealed interval enlargement of ventricular dilation, and a subsequent lumbar puncture showed a pressure of 29, leading to the placement of a ventricular drain with pressures under 12.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient may be at risk for developing a more severe UTI due to her mental retardation and current condition.
2. Altered Mental Status (not delirium): The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to an infection or other underlying causes, which need to be further evaluated and managed.
3. Constipation (obstipation, FOS): The patient is experiencing bowel distension, likely due to constipation. This needs to be addressed and treated appropriately.
4. History of Seizure, without status epilepticus: The"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   54 yo F with mental retardation transferred from an outside hospital
   who presents with mental status changes and fever, found to be
   fluid-responsive hypotensive in th ER.
   1. Previous Fever/mental status changes: The patient at baseline has
   severe mental retardation and would likely be susceptible to any
   delirium regardless of the source.  The Leukocytosis in context of
   fever is of course concerning for infection, but fever has resolved.
   The urine analysis at the outside hospital was weakly positive and may
   represent a mild urinary tract infection.  However given the patient
   significant mental status changes, we initially had concern for neuro
   infection. Hence, an LP was performed. Analysis of CSF was not
   remarkable except for pressure approaching 30. Moreover, review of
   [**Hospital3 **] CT with neurosurgery was remarkable for interval
   ventricular dilatation. Hence, a drain was placed s/p the LP. Drain
   pressures have been [**2-25**].
   In light of the evolving neurologic picture, mental status changes are
   now likely secondary to UTI and/or hydrocephalus. The only other option
   on the diff is an aspiration PNA ?seen as subtle changes in the right
   lung base. All things considered, the Ancef should continue s/p drain
   placement clarify with NS for course), but I do not feel strongly about
   the other abx.
   -Discuss Abx with team.
   -Clarify Ancef course w NS
   -Clarify Drain course with NS
   -notify for pressure greater than 18
   - follow up outstanding cultures
   2. Hypotension: Now resolved.  The patient was hypotensive that was
   fluid responsive and now normotensive.  Will follow blood pressures and
   bolus as needed.
   3. Hypernatremia: 147 today, in midst of D5W correction.
   -Re-calculate defecit and adjust fluids today; basic parameters as
   usual
[**11-18**] defecit in first 24 hours only.
   -Repeat CHM 7 this evening
   #. HCT drop: 5 points overnight. Received fluids but can
t alone
   explain drop by dilution. In setiing if new shunt, some concern for
   head bleed, though would expect to see increased pressures on drain.
   -Repeat HCT today
   -inform NS of drop
   -Guaic all stool
   4. Hydrocephalus:  The patient is currently asymptomatic but with
   significant hydrocephalus on CT at osh, s/p LP and drain placement as
   above. Please [**Last Name **] problem #1 for plan, and:
   - discuss with NS replacement of old shunt. It is not possible to
   determine if this shunt is still functioning.
   5. Bowel distension:  Likely with constipation.  Good BM yesterday.
   Will treat with bowel meds.
   -con
t Bowel meds
   6. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient is currently in normal sinus
   rhythm.  Will restart aspirin when no longer has potential for shunt
   evaluation.
   7. Hypothyroidism: Patient will continue on home medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with mental retardation who was transferred from an outside hospital.
- She presented with mental status changes and fever, and was found to be fluid-responsive hypotensive in the ER.
- The patient has severe mental retardation and is susceptible to any delirium.
- She had a previous fever and mental status changes, with leukocytosis in the context of fever, suggesting an infection.
- A urinary tract infection (UTI) was weakly positive and may represent a mild UTI.
- The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) which showed a high CSF pressure but no remarkable findings.
- A CT scan revealed interval ventricular dilatation, and a drain was placed after the LP.
- The patient's mental status changes are now likely secondary to UTI and/or hydrocephalus.
- She also has constipation and an altered mental status that is not delirium.
- The patient's blood pressure has resolved, and she is now normotensive.
- Her sodium levels are high at 147, and she is receiving D5W correction.
- There was a significant drop in hematocrit (HCT) overnight, and repeat HCT is needed.
- The patient has a history of seizure, without status epilepticus.
- She has a shunt in place, but its functionality cannot be determined.
- The patient's bowel is mildly distended, likely due"

 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   54 yo F with mental retardation transferred from an outside hospital
   who presents with mental status changes and fever, found to be
   fluid-responsive hypotensive in th ER.
   1. Previous Fever/mental status changes: The patient at baseline has
   severe mental retardation and would likely be susceptible to any
   delirium regardless of the source.  The Leukocytosis in context of
   fever is of course concerning for infection, but fever has resolved.
   The urine analysis at the outside hospital was weakly positive and may
   represent a mild urinary tract infection.  However given the patient
   significant mental status changes, we initially had concern for neuro
   infection. Hence, an LP was performed. Analysis of CSF was not
   remarkable except for pressure approaching 30. Moreover, review of
   [**Hospital3 **] CT with neurosurgery was remarkable for interval
   ventricular dilatation. Hence, a drain was placed s/p the LP. Drain
   pressures have been [**2-25**].
   In light of the evolving neurologic picture, mental status changes are
   now likely secondary to UTI and/or hydrocephalus. The only other option
   on the diff is an aspiration PNA ?seen as subtle changes in the right
   lung base. Ancef and bactrim to continue, no other Abx at this time.
   -ANCEF and Bactrim to continue
   -NS will likely pull drain today.
   -notify for pressure greater than 18
   - follow up outstanding cultures
   2. Hypotension: Now resolved.  The patient was hypotensive that was
   fluid responsive and now normotensive.  Will follow blood pressures and
   bolus as needed.
   -Inactive issue
   3. Hypernatremia: 147 yesterday
 142 today s/p free water
   -Repeat CHM 7 this evening
   #. HCT drop: 5 points overnight. Received fluids but can
t alone
   explain drop by dilution. In setiing if new shunt, some concern for
   head bleed, though would expect to see increased pressures on drain.
   -Stable at 35.1

   -Guaic all stool
   -con

   4. Hydrocephalus:  The patient is currently asymptomatic but with
   significant hydrocephalus on CT at osh, s/p LP and drain placement as
   above. Please [**Last Name **] problem #1 for plan, and:
   - discuss with NS replacement of old shunt. It is not possible to
   determine if this shunt is still functioning.
   5. Bowel distension:  Likely with constipation.  Good BM yesterday.
   Will treat with bowel meds.
   -con
t Bowel meds
   6. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient is currently in normal sinus
   rhythm.  Will restart aspirin when no longer has potential for shunt
   evaluation.
   7. Hypothyroidism: Patient will continue on home medications.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with mental retardation who was transferred from an outside hospital with mental status changes and fever. She presented with fluid-responsive hypotension in the ER. The patient has a history of seizure, but without status epilepticus.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder, Other
2. Impaired Skin Integrity
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
4. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium)
5. Constipation (Obstipation, FOS)
6. H/O Seizure, Without Status Epilepticus

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, urinary tract infection (UTI), altered mental status (not delirium), constipation, and a history of seizure without status epilepticus.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening of the UTI leading to sepsis, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, worsening of the electrolyte imbalance, further deterioration of mental status, and potential complications related to constipation such as bowel perforation or obstruction. Additionally, there is a concern for a potential head bleed or shunt malfunction in the setting of hydrocephalus."

","Based on the provided information, the patient has multiple medical conditions and complications. The chief complaints include hypotension, altered mental status, hydrocephalus, and anemia. 

The patient is currently in the ICU with a ventricular drain in place, receiving free water, and has no fever. The vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, but the patient is on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation of 98%. The intracranial pressure (ICP) is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, no tubes or drains in the throat, normal cardiovascular function, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in the extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination except for altered mental status.

The lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, elevated leukocyte count, normal kidney function, slightly low platelet count, normal electrolyte levels, and normal glucose levels.

The assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, urinary tract infection (UTI), altered mental status, constipation, history of seizure, anemia, and mental status at baseline.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrence of elevated intracranial pressures if the ventricular drain is removed.
2. UTI due to the presence of a urinary catheter.
3. Constipation due to immob"

   54 yo F with mental retardation transferred from an outside hospital
   who presents with mental status changes and fever, found to be
   fluid-responsive hypotensive in th ER.
   1. Previous Fever/mental status changes: The patient at baseline has
   severe mental retardation and would likely be susceptible to any
   delirium regardless of the source.  The Leukocytosis in context of
   fever is of course concerning for infection, but fever has resolved.
   The urine analysis at the outside hospital was weakly positive and may
   represent a mild urinary tract infection.  However given the patient
   significant mental status changes, we initially had concern for neuro
   infection. Hence, an LP was performed. Analysis of CSF was not
   remarkable except for pressure approaching 30. Moreover, review of
   [**Hospital3 **] CT with neurosurgery was remarkable for interval
   ventricular dilatation. Hence, a drain was placed s/p the LP. Drain
   pressures have been [**2-25**].
   In light of the evolving neurologic picture, mental status changes are
   now likely secondary to hydrocephalus. The only other option on the
   diff is an aspiration PNA ?seen as subtle changes in the right lung
   base. Received last dose of Ancef this AM, Bactrim continues.
   - Bactrim to continue
   -NS will see today, then sigh-off.
   - follow up outstanding cultures
   2. Hypotension: Now resolved.  The patient was hypotensive that was
   fluid responsive and now normotensive.  Will follow blood pressures and
   bolus as needed.

   -Repeat CHM 7 this evening
   # HCT drop: 5 points overnight. Received fluids but can

The assessment and plan section of the note highlights several issues:

1. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other: The patient had hypernatremia, which improved today after repletion with free water.

2. Impaired skin integrity: There are no specific findings mentioned in the physical examination regarding skin integrity.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had a weakly positive urine analysis for infection at the outside hospital, but the CSF analysis was not remarkable except for pressure approaching 30. The drain pressures have been ranging from 2-25.

4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The mental status changes are now likely secondary to hydrocephalus, as confirmed by the interval ventricular dilatation seen on CT with neurosurgery. A drain was placed after the LP.

5. Constipation (obstipation, FOS): The patient has bowel distension, which is likely due to constipation. Good BM was reported yesterday, and bowel medications will be continued.

6. H/o seizure, without status epilepticus: There is no mention of any seizures in the current hospital stay.

7. Hypothyroidism: The patient will continue on home medications for hypothyroidism.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with mental status changes. The patient has an ICP catheter that was stopped on 11/5/2106 at 03:45 PM and drain removed. The patient's serum sodium level is normal after free water repletion, but they still require maintenance free water due to an inability to drink on their own. The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, and their respiratory rate is slightly elevated. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their oxygen saturation is at 96%. The patient's vital signs show a slightly low body temperature and a normal heart rate. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, which has been corrected. However, they still require maintenance free water due to their inability to drink on their own.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is no mention of any skin breakdown or pressure ulcers.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): There is no specific evidence of a UTI mentioned in the progress note.
4. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient's mental status seems to be at baseline, and there is no indication of delirium.
5. Constipation (Obstipation, FOS): The patient is experiencing constipation, but it is being managed with fiber supplementation and other interventions"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of mental status changes. The patient has been in the ICU and is receiving various treatments, including an ICP catheter, antibiotics, heparin sodium, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/89 mmHg to 171/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for flowsheet data showing fluid balance, respiratory support, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has a history of electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient is overweight/obese and has poor dentition, which may increase the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and proper positioning are essential to prevent these complications.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Given the patient's prolonged hospital stay and use of urinary catheters, there is an increased risk of UTI. Frequent urinalysis and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered.
4. Altered Mental Status (not"
