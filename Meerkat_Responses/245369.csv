   A/P: 55 yo with EtOH cirrhosis with hypotension, decreased UOP,
   dehydration, and ARF.
   .
   # hypotension: Most likely explaination is that he is intravascularly
   dry since last hospitalization, lasix restarted, and decreased liquid
   PO coupled with fluid shift from large volume paracentesis yesterday.
   Other concern is infection, including SBP.  S/P diagnostic paracentesis
   upon arrival to ICU with only 56 WBCs, not diagnostic for SBP.
   - IVF
   - infection workup(BCx, UCx)
   - another 50g tonight
   - cont cipro ppx
   - monitor UOP
   .
   # elevated creatinine: Above baseline, has had creatinine in the 2s
   before.  Likely prerenal given decreased PO, dry on exam, restarting
   lasix after ARF at OSH.  ATN also possible because of low BP.  Concern
   remains for hepatorenal syndrome.
   - IVF fluid
   - urine lytes
   - albumin 50g x 1 upon admission and again overnight
   .
   # pancytopenia: chronic, thought [**1-16**] hepatic dysfunction.  Roughly at
   baseline, though HCT higher (likely dry).

","The patient is a middle-aged male with a chief complaint of hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). He has a history of EtOH cirrhosis. The patient underwent paracentesis, which showed 56 WBCs and was not diagnostic for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently being treated with IV fluids, infection workup, albumin infusion, and antibiotics for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/46 to 74/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His physical examination reveals sclerae anicteric, no jugular venous distension, decreased breath sounds on the left side, mild rhonchi on the right side, regular heart rhythm, normoactive bowel sounds, grossly distended abdomen, mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, healed surgical scar, umbilical hernia, 1+ lower extremity edema with venous stasis changes, and a skin break in the right lower extremity covered with a clear dressing.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 1.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.7%, platelet count of 19 K/uL, and lactic"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with cirrhosis who presented to the clinic hypotensive and later found to have a slight increase in left pleural effusion. He responded partially to intravenous fluids (IVF) and was sent to the emergency department. No evidence of infection was found, and he reported poor oral intake with some cough. He received vancomycin and ceftriaxone in the emergency department.

The patient underwent a diagnostic paracentesis that was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He continued on outpatient ciprofloxacin and lactulose for slight asterixis. He received 4 liters of IVF and albumin 50g twice for elevated creatinine levels.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/53 mmHg to 101/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,535 mL and 2,852 mL, with a total output of 540 mL and 2,452 mL. The patient has received blood products, IV fluids, and oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. His ABG results show a pH of 7.19.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with cirrhosis who presented with hypotension and low blood pressure in the clinic. He has been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and received treatment in the emergency department. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to labile blood pressure/hypotension and concerns for progressive sepsis. He is currently being treated for multiple conditions, including hypotension, acute kidney injury, cirrhosis, left pleural effusion, leukopenia, diabetes mellitus, and fecal encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor if he continues to remain stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in origin but appeared prerenal. He is receiving intravenous fluids and albumin, and further investigations such as ascites culture and sputum culture are planned.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, and urine electrolytes and renal ultrasound are pending. Further evaluation and management are needed to address the ARF.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, and his liver recommendations will be followed up. He is being encouraged to maintain a positive intake and continue with rifaximin/lactulose therapy.
4. Left Pleural Effusion: The patient has an old left pleural"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who presented to the clinic hypotensive with a SBP of 60s, experiencing some lightheadedness. He was sent to the emergency department where no evidence of infection was found, but he reported poor oral intake and a cough. The patient responded to intravenous fluids (IVF) and was given vancomycin/ceftazidime in the emergency department. A chest X-ray showed a slight increase in left pleural effusion, which is old.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, likely due to cirrhosis-related complications such as ascites and possibly renal dysfunction. He also has an old left pleural effusion that may be suspicious for pneumonia. The patient is pancytopenic (low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and low hemoglobin) and has been receiving IVF and albumin for fluid management. His blood glucose levels are well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in origin but appears to be prerenal. The patient is receiving IVF and albumin, and further investigations such as ascites culture and sputum culture are planned. Foley catheter placement is also attempted to monitor urinary output.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, dehydration, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient continues to have issues with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and albumin administration. His paracentesis showed only 56 white blood cells, and cultures are pending. The main concern for infection is pulmonary, and he is already on levofloxacin since yesterday. He also has a history of resistant E. coli in peritoneal fluid and possible right lower extremity cellulitis.

The patient's Foley catheter placement was unsuccessful, and he has urinary retention. A bladder scan confirmed this finding. His renal ultrasound did not show evidence of hydronephrosis or post-obstructive pathology.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other abnormal liver function tests. His blood cultures are pending.

The assessment and plan include expanding antibiotics to cover pulmonary sources, resistant E. coli, right lower extremity cellulitis, atypical organisms, and gram-positive bacteria. Monitoring of urine output is also important, along with the placement of a central line for volume assessment.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further infections, particularly due to his resistant E. coli history and pulmonary concerns. Additionally, the patient"

The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, which could be related to hepatorenal syndrome or other causes of renal failure. 

A pleural effusion has been identified, which may be a source of infection or worsening respiratory status. Diagnostic and possibly therapeutic tapping of the effusion is planned, but the patient will need platelets and possibly fresh frozen plasma (FFP) before the procedure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, decreased urine output (UOP), dehydration, and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The assessment and plan section of the note outlines several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension: The most likely explanation for the patient's hypotension is intravascular dehydration. This could be due to decreased liquid intake, fluid shift from a large volume paracentesis, or an infection.

2. Elevated creatinine: Despite receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and albumin, the patient's creatinine levels are worsening. This raises concern for hepatorenal syndrome, but other etiologies of renal failure should also be evaluated.

3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a chronic but larger pleural effusion, which could be a source of infection or worsening respiratory status. A diagnostic tap or therapeutic thoracentesis may be necessary, but it will require platelets and possibly fresh frozen plasma (FFP) beforehand.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has chronic pancytopenia, which is often seen in liver disease. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia are common in these cases. A previous workup should be reviewed, and a new workup may be needed at some point.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with cirrhosis who presented to the clinic hypotensive and lightheaded. He was sent to the emergency department, where he responded to intravenous fluids but had no evidence of infection. A paracentesis was performed, showing transudate. Overnight, the patient remained hypotensive and a left thoracentesis was performed, also showing transudate. The patient stopped urinating and was unable to have a Foley catheter placed. Renal ultrasound showed no obstruction. Nadalol was held, and the patient received 100g of albumin. His white blood cell count rose today, and a stim test is pending. An ultrasound was performed on 02/10/20 at 04:00 PM, and a thoracentesis was done on 02/10/20 at 06:06 PM.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has respiratory failure, hypotension, and ascites. Possible sepsis sources include community-acquired pneumonia. Broaden antibiotics to vancomycin, levofloxacin, and zosyn, check for Clostridium difficile, and administer albumin for intravascular volume. Place a central venous line for early goal-directed therapy and perform a transthoracic echocardiogram today. The patient is also concerning for acute tubular necrosis, so place a Foley catheter with urology, check urine electrolytes, and administer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who presented to the ICU with hypotension and a suspected infection. He underwent a therapeutic paracentesis but was found to have a transudate, indicating no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). However, the patient's condition worsened overnight with persistent hypotension and the development of respiratory failure. He also stopped urinating and required a Foley catheter placement due to renal failure. An ultrasound showed no obstruction, and the patient received 100g of albumin. The patient's white blood cell count rose today, and a stim test is pending. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 26 to 20, and he received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient has venous stasis on both legs and asterixis in his neurologic examination. His vital signs are stable, but he is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula. The patient has multiple lab abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal coagulation parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to sepsis or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which may be related to his underlying liver disease or a superimposed infection."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old individual with a history of EtOH cirrhosis and hypotension. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, ascites, sepsis, acute kidney injury, pleural effusion, pancytopenia, cirrhosis with encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus, and feeding intolerance.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, and the source of sepsis needs to be identified. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's renal function is concerning, and there is a possibility of acute tubular necrosis. Foley catheter placement is recommended, along with urine electrolyte analysis, and additional supportive measures.

3. Pleural Effusion: A thoracentesis was performed, and the effusion was found to be transudative. Further follow-up is necessary to monitor the patient's respiratory status and assess for any worsening effusion.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing a decrease in all blood cell types. Further evaluation is required to determine the underlying cause, which may include bone marrow suppression or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

5. Cirrhosis with Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease is worsening, leading to increased enceph"

   A/P: 55 yo with EtOH cirrhosis with hypotension, decreased UOP,
   dehydration, and ARF.
   .
   GNR Pneumonia: Growing GNRs in sputum culture. On vanc/levo/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for
   broad coverage including atypical coverage and the [**Last Name (un) 430**] for history of
   resistant  Ecoli in peritoneal fluid.  Also has possible RLE
   cellulitis.  UOP continues to be low, though complicated by ARF.
   - f/u cultures
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotics to [**Last Name (un) 430**] (pulm source, hx of resistant
   ecoli), levo for atypicals, vanc for GPs and cellulitis
   - CMV VL pending
   - monitor MAP and CVP as per sepsis protocol
   # hypotension: he has received significant  fluid resuscitation,
   albumin, and blood products, BP finally better over last 12-24 hrs.
   Infection continues to be the primary concern as above.  Paracentesis
   showed only 56 WBCs, culture NTD.  Pleural fluid NTD, transudative.
   ECHO with dilated atria, but normal LV systolic fxn with suboptimal
   windows.  CVP above goal.
   - monitor UOP (foley now in place)
   - central line in place for volume assessment
   - fluid with albumin, blood products prn for volume expansion
   # elevated creatinine: worsening creatinine despite IVF and albumin.
   Concern remains for hepatorenal syndrome though other etiologies of
   renal failure should be evaluated.  Renal u/s wnl.  Also may have
   obstructive component given residuals, unable to check urine lytes and
   culture until now.  ATN also on differential.  Urine sodium very low
   consistent with prerenal or hepatorenal.  Also has elevated bladder
   pressure of 29 on [**2147-2-12**].
   - foley in place (appreciate urology)
   - urine lytes, culture
   - albumin 25g qday per liver recs
   - midodrine 7.5 tid and octreotide 100mg sc q 8 per liver recs
   - monitor bladder pressure, if consistently elevated, will need
   paracentesis
   # Pleural effusion: s/p thoracentesis on [**2-11**], transudative.
   - f/u cultures
   # pancytopenia: chronic, thought [**1-16**] hepatic dysfunction, though
   unclear workup in past.  Anemia and thrombocytopenia often seen in
   liver disease, leucopenia occurs but less frequent.  Roughly at
   baseline, though WBC increased.  HCT did not bump appropriately to Bcx
   times 4, intermittently guaiac positive with known gastropathy.  No
   apparent brisk GI bleed.  Plts remain in the 20s despite transfusion,
   likely sequestering in spleen. DIC labs not helpful in a cirrhotic.
   - trend TID HCT, platelets
   - transfuse prn
   - tx for plt < 10, bleeding
   - tx for HCT < 21
   # DM2:
   - cont home NPH
   - ISS
   # liver: LFTs at recent baseline as are bili and coags. subjective mild
   hepatic encephalopathy.  On transplant list.  Worsening asterixis
   today.
   - lactulose goal [**4-19**] stools per day
   - liver recs
   - hepatorenal and hypotension workup/treatment as above
   - consider para later today if bladder pressure remains high
   # hyponatremia: from underlying liver disease
   - follow
   # FEN: reg diet, low sodium.  replete lytes prn.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 55 yo with EtOH cirrhosis with hypotension, decreased UOP,
   dehydration, and ARF.
   # hypotension: Continues to have problems with hypotension despite
   fluid resuscitation, albumin making infection the primary concern.
   Paracentesis showed only 56 WBCs, culture NTD.  Pleural fluid NTD,
   transudative.  Main infectious concern is pulmonary, on levofloxacin
   since yesterday.  Has history of resistant  Ecoli in peritoneal fluid.
   Also has possible RLE cellulitis.  UOP has been low.
   - f/u cultures, check Urine culture.
   - expand antibiotics to [**Last Name (un) 430**] (pulm source, hx of resistant ecoli), levo
   for atypicals, vanc for GPs and cellulitis
   - monitor UOP (foley now in place)
   - ECHO for cardiac etiology
   - central line for volume assessment
   - fluid with albumen
   - CMV VL
   # elevated creatinine: worsening creatinine despite IVF and albumin.
   Concern remains for hepatorenal syndrome though other etiologies of
   renal failure should be evaluated.  Renal u/s wnl.  Also may have
   obstructive component given residuals, unable to check urine lytes and
   culture until now.  ATN also on differential.
   - place foley
   - urine lytes, culture
   - albumin 50g qday
   -  midodrine 7.5 tid and octreotide 100mg sc q 8 per liver recs
   # Pleural effusion: s/p thoracentesis on [**2-11**], transudative.
   - f/u cultures
   # pancytopenia: chronic, thought [**1-16**] hepatic dysfunction, though
   unclear workup in past.  Anemia and thrombocytopenia often seen in
   liver disease, leucopenia occurs but less frequent.  Roughly at
   baseline, though WBC increased today.  Anemia worse today, no obvious
   signs of bleed, getting pRBCs currently.
   - trend

   # liver: LFTs at recent baseline as are bili and coags. subjective mild
   hepatic encephalopathy.  On transplant list.  Worsening asterixis
   today.
   - increase lactulose goal [**4-19**] stools per day
   - liver recs
   - hepatorenal and hypotension workup/treatment as above

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for management. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, and possible right lower extremity cellulitis.

On review of systems, the patient's flow sheet data shows that his vital signs are within normal limits, but he is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 101/46 mmHg. His heart rate is 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula, and central venous pressure is 25 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1.6 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 19. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes are also abnormal.

The patient's assessment includes hypotension, decreased urine output, dehydration, and acute kidney injury. The plan includes expanding antibiotics due to a history of resistant E. coli, monitoring urine output, performing an echocardiogram for cardiac etiology, placing a central line for volume assessment, and initiating albumin and midodrine therapy for hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, hepatoren"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who presented to the clinic hypotensive and with suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient responded to intravenous fluids (IVF) and paracentesis, which was negative for SBP. The patient's condition has been complicated by various issues, including hypotension, respiratory failure, acute anemia, and potential hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), as well as elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), bilirubin levels, and lactate. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is also elevated at 3.0.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension, suspected sepsis, BP improved, source likely PNA - continue with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and levofloxacin, follow up sputum culture, check lactate and central venous saturation.
2. Respiratory failure,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with cirrhosis who underwent a therapeutic paracentesis. He presented with hypotension and was found to have a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 60s in the clinic. The patient responded to intravenous fluids (IVF) and was sent to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. The paracentesis was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, leading to concerns about sepsis. Central venous pressure (CVP) was monitored and maintained between 22-25 mmHg. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, including vancomycin for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient's blood cultures showed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR). 

The patient's respiratory status was also evaluated, suspecting hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He was kept NPO due to dysphagia and a swallow evaluation was planned. Cirrhosis management included continuing hepatorenal therapy, holding nadalol, monitoring rising bilirubin levels, and continuing rifaximin and lactulose. Acute renal failure (ARF) was considered, with the possibility of prerenal or hepatorenal causes.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who presents with hypotension, decreased urine output, dehydration, and acute renal failure (ARF). He also has a suspected case of GN pneumonia and right lower extremity cellulitis, for which he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition is complicated by hepatorenal syndrome and the need for dialysis, as well as potential aspiration due to his altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 106/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His CVP is elevated at 26 mmHg, and his bladder pressure is 20 mmHg. His mixed venous O2 saturation is within normal range at 95-97%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14,100 cells/mm3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 20,000 cells/mm3, elevated creatinine levels at 3.8 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mEq/L, and hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin level of 5.1 mg/dL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with cirrhosis who has undergone a therapeutic paracentesis. He presented to the clinic hypotensive with a blood pressure of 60s in the SBP and some lightheadedness. The patient was sent to the emergency department and responded to intravenous fluids (IVF). Paracentesis was negative for SBP.

The patient's condition worsened, leading to the placement of a central venous line (CVL) due to concerns for sepsis. The patient's CVP improved slightly. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were broadened to include vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's 24-hour events include bladder pressure at 20 and concerns about acute renal failure (ARF). Renal consultation was called out. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tmax: 36.0°C (96.8°F)
- Tcurrent: 35.3°C (95.5°F)
- HR: 87 bpm (63 - 92 bpm)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with cirrhosis, presenting with pneumonia (PNA) and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), fatty liver disease (FEN), and cellulitis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, ascites, and anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 117/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 25 mmHg. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), renal failure, and hypotension (not in shock). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection indicated by the presence of pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis if not appropriately treated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which may result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxicity from medications, and the need for dialysis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could indicate poor perfusion and may be a sign of sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Monitoring and managing blood pressure is crucial to prevent organ dysfunction.
4. Ascites: The patient has fluid accumulation in the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with hypotension and was found to have an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. The patient's condition worsened, leading to the placement of a central venous line due to concern for sepsis. The patient was also diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, and he has developed several complications, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pneumonia caused by ESBL E. coli, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which may be related to sepsis, but it has improved with treatment. Ascites is also noted as a complication of cirrhosis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia and abnormalities in liver function tests. The platelet count is slightly low, and the creatinine level is elevated, indicating renal dysfunction.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
2. Anemia, other
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
4. Hypotension (not shock)
5. Ascites

The treatment plan includes changing antibiotics to cover ESBL-producing E. coli, continuing vancomycin for cellulitis, maintaining CVP >12, initiating hemodial"
