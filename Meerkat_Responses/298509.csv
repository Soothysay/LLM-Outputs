   Assessment and Plan
   30 yo M with PMH of schizoaffective disorder who presents after
   drinking 3 bottles of robitussin to ""get high."" He has a presumed
   anticholinergic overdose given his clinical picture of low fever, dry
   axilla, tachycardia, agitation, dilated pupils.  In addition, he was
   given physostigmine in the ED with reported good response. The half
   life of physostigmine is 15 mins. This medication can be repeated x1 if
   needed. DDx also includes infection, uremia, head trauma. He has no
   signs of infection with a negative U/A and clear CXR. Meningitis is
   always on the ddx but given the history of ingestion, lack of headache
   or neck stiffness, overdose is more likely.
   .
   # anticholinergic toxicity: No ectopy on telemetry, and no QRS widening
   - QT prolongation on EKG from yesterday
   -use haldol benzos (diazepam) for agitation as this will not affect
   cardiac conduction and other meds will -> can safely use haldol at this
   time given nml eKG for > 24 hours.
   - CK mildly elevated.
   -rest of tox screens were negative including acetaminophen and
   salicylates which are common co-ingestions
   -appreciate toxicology consult in ED- no further rec's
   -consider head CT to rule out other cause of agitation such as bleed or
   mass - currently calm and without complaints so not needed at this
   time.
   -denies suicidal ideations- on 1:1 sitter, section 12 -- cannot leave
   AMA.
   -CIWA scale give history of alcohol intake although he denies use in
   the last day and tox screen was negative. Can likely discontinue this
   soon.
   -psychiatry consult and SW consult
   .
   #Psych: will need inpatient psych admission on discharge from
   hospital.  Schizoaffective vs. Bipolar disorder.
   - haldol PRN for agitation
   - Start screening for dual diagnosis centers
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Likely leukemoid reaction [**12-23**] to stress.  Does c/o URI
   symptoms x3 days.  No localizing source for infection - negative Ua.
   Normalizing today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU after ingesting three bottles of Robitussin to get high. He is experiencing symptoms consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, including low fever, dry axilla, tachycardia, agitation, and dilated pupils. The patient responded well to physostigmine in the emergency department.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anticholinergic toxicity: The patient's symptoms align with anticholinergic toxicity, which can cause hyperthermia, mydriasis (dilated pupils), dry skin and mucous membranes, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Close monitoring for worsening symptoms is necessary.

2. Infection: Although the patient does not show signs of infection, it is still important to consider the possibility of infection, especially since he has a history of alcohol abuse. Regular monitoring of vital signs and lab parameters will help identify any potential infection early.

3. Uremia: Elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal dysfunction or uremia. Further evaluation of renal function and appropriate management should be considered.

4. Head trauma: The patient's ingestion of Robitussin raises concerns about potential co-ingestions or self-harm behaviors. A head CT should be considered to rule out any underlying head trauma.

5. Alcohol withdrawal: Despite a negative toxicology screen for alcohol, the patient's history of alcohol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, ethanol abuse, and prior suicide attempts. He presented with clinical signs of anticholinergic toxicity after consuming three bottles of Robitussin in an attempt to get high. His symptoms have resolved following administration of physostigmine, and repeat dosing was not required. His tachycardia and hypertension have also resolved. He is now stable for transfer to the psychiatric floor for admission. He has a history of substance abuse and will be receiving appropriate interventions and medications for this.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anticholinergic toxicity: The patient initially presented with symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity, which include dry skin, hyperthermia, dilated pupils, urinary retention, and altered mental status. These symptoms can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Ethanol abuse: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, which puts him at risk for complications such as liver disease, pancreatitis, malnutrition, and increased susceptibility to infections.

3. Psychiatric complications: The patient has a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and has made prior suicide attempts. He may be at risk for further psychiatric episodes or self-harm while in the psychiatric unit.

4. Substance withdrawal: The patient may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms from substances he has abused, such as alcohol or drugs. This can lead to complications like seizures, delirium tremens, or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, frequent visits to the emergency department for overdose (dextromethorphan), and prior suicide attempts. He was found wandering in the street with altered mental status and reported that he was trying to ""get high"" by drinking three bottles of Robitussin. He denied any suicidal intentions.

The patient presented with symptoms consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, which have now resolved. His ECG showed no abnormalities, CPK levels are normalizing, and liver function tests are within normal limits. He also developed leukocytosis, which has resolved.

The patient's psychiatric condition is likely schizoaffective disorder versus bipolar disorder. He was agitated and received Haloperidol, which is safe to use given the resolution of anticholinergic toxicity. The patient will be transferred to the psychiatric department for inpatient admission with a 1:1 sitter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anticholinergic toxicity: The patient initially presented with symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity due to excessive consumption of Robitussin, which contains dextromethorphan. This can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, dilated pupils, dry skin, decreased bowel sounds, and urinary retention. The patient's symptoms have resolved, indicating successful management of this complication.

2. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse. Continued monitoring"

","The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of schizoaffective disorder, ethanol abuse, prior suicide attempts, and prior drug overdoses. He presented with clinical signs of anticholinergic toxicity after consuming three bottles of Robitussin in an attempt to get high.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm (range 61-117 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 107/69 mmHg (range 77-150/88 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (range 19-36 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no muscle wasting. Neurological examination showed that the patient was attentive, oriented, and had normal tone.

Laboratory results showed:
- Hemoglobin: 16.3 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 17.5 K/uL (decreased from 11.9 K/uL)
- Platelet count: 243 K/uL (decreased from 241 K/uL)
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
- Glucose: 130 mg/dL (decreased from 96 mg/dL)
- Calcium: 9.3 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
- Phosphorus: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's condition has improved, with resolution of anticholinergic toxicity and leukocytosis. The patient's ETOH abuse requires a substance abuse consultation, and nicotine patch therapy has been initiated for tobacco abuse. The patient is expected to be transferred to the psychiatric department for inpatient admission, with continued 1:1 sitter care."
