   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.  He
   is at baseline mental status this morning following commands but not
   completely oriented.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis
   Given discriminant function of ~46 pt would otherwise benefit from
   steroids; however both steroids and pentoxifylline contraindicated
   given head bleeding, discussed with GI.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Liver recommendations appreciated re: Steroid.
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   FeNa <0.25% yesterday c/w pre-renal state. Patient given fluid
   challenge this morning, will reassess Cr response on repeat labs this
   afternoon. Most concerning cause would be hepatorenal syndrome.  Fluid
   challenge complete, patient putting out urine despite rising
   Creatinine.
   - Albumin, midodrine, and octreotide per renal recommendations
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Paracentesis today to r/o SBP
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   - D/C Keppra
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Acidosis
   Patient has both gap (18) and nongap acidosis. Nongap likely due to
   saline resuscitation +/- stool output. Renal failure may be
   contributory.
   - Check lactate given anion gap
   - Discontinue IVF
   7. Hypernatremia
   - Will increase free water boluses with tube feeds to 250 q4
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   8. Hypertension
   Bp currently under good control patient has not received BB recently
   - Hold atenolol and ACEI in setting of renal failure
   9. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   10. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - Keep type and screen active, transfuse hct>25
   - PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, who presented to the hospital after a fall. He was found to have alcoholic hepatitis and subsequently suffered a subdural hematoma. Currently, the patient is stable on repeat imaging and is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. However, he has disorientation to time and is not completely oriented.

The patient has multiple medical complications including alcoholic hepatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, subdural hematoma, confusion (possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy), leukocytosis (most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis), acidosis (nongap likely due to saline resuscitation +/- stool output), hypernatremia, hypertension, EtoH abuse, and anemia with a history of melena.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alcoholic hepatitis - Nutritional support with enteral feeding, trend LFTs and INR daily, liver recommendations appreciated re: Steroid.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure - Albumin, midodrine, and octreotide per renal recommendations, hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins, follow Cr daily, renal recommendations appreciated.
3. Subdural hematoma - Stable on serial imaging, no immediate surgical intervention planned per neurosurgery, neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital, serial neuro exams.
4. Confusion - Lactulose and rif"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has undergone paracentesis, where 2 liters of fluid were removed. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been taken. The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. The patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and haloperidol (Haldol) in the ICU. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute, low blood pressure ranging from 106/68 mmHg to 127/73 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% while on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 92.4 kg at admission to 101 kg currently. 

The patient has received a total of 4,483 mL of fluids, with 2,889 mL given intravenously. The patient has lost a total of 4,110 mL of fluids, including 1,310 mL of urine output. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the ABG results show a pH of 7.20. 

The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examinations are not assessed. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T, and abnormal liver function tests. The fluid analysis of the peritoneal fluid indicates the presence of leukocytes, elevated total protein, and albumin levels. 

Imaging includes an abdominal ultrasound that was not read and a chest X-ray showing decreased aeration and increased generalized opacity, possibly due to film exposure. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired knowledge, inability to manage money/personal finances, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired skin integrity, liver function abnormalities, and a subdural hemorrhage (SDH). 

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren Renal (Full), glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is unknown."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis
   Given discriminant function of ~46 pt would otherwise benefit from
   steroids; however both steroids and pentoxifylline contraindicated
   given head bleeding, discussed with GI.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   FeNa <0.25% yesterday c/w pre-renal state. Patient given fluid
   challenge this morning, will reassess Cr response on repeat labs this
   afternoon. Most concerning cause would be hepatorenal syndrome.
   Additional consideration is contrast nephropathy given CT abdomen [**2-22**].
   Other considerations AIN [**3-16**] abx and ATN [**3-16**] hypotension seem less
   likely.
   - Albumin, midodrine, and octreotide per renal recommendations
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Paracentesis today to r/o SBP
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   - Would discuss need for keppra with neurosurgery
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Acidosis
   Patient has both gap (18) and nongap acidosis. Nongap likely due to
   saline resuscitation +/- stool output. Renal failure may be
   contributory.
   - Check lactate given anion gap
   - Discontinue IVF
   .
   7. Hypernatremia
   - Will increase free water boluses with tube feeds
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   .
   8. Hypertension
   Bp currently under good control patient has not received BB recently
   - Hold atenolol and ACEI in setting of renal failure
   .
   9. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   .
   10. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - Keep type and screen active, transfuse hct>25
   - PPI

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who presented to the hospital after a fall and was diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis. He also suffered a subdural hematoma, which is currently stable on repeat imaging.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 106/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's mental status is described as disoriented to place and time but opens eyes to voice, answers questions, and follows commands without asterixis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal renal function tests with an elevated creatinine level. The fluid analysis of the ascitic fluid is consistent with infection (positive neutrophils, elevated protein, elevated lactate dehydrogenase).

The patient's current medical plan includes nutritional support with enteral feeding, monitoring of liver function tests and international normalized ratio daily, and considering liver recommendations. He also requires management for acute on chronic renal failure, which includes albumin, midodrine, and octreotide per renal recommendations, holding ACE inhibitors, dosing"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.  He
   is at baseline mental status this morning following commands but not
   completely oriented.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis: Patient
s LFTs continue to trend downward.
   Feeding persists via doboff tube.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Liver recommendations appreciated re: Steroids
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pre-renal etiology combined with
   possible Contrast induced nephropathy.  Unlikely heptaorenal syndrome.
   Cr improving but urine output not significantly improving.
   - Restart midodrine, and octreotide
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Fluid hydration & free water.
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~4.2 L with ongoing 100mL losses
   per hour in stool
   - Consult nutrition for minimum sodium feeds
   - D5W 200mL/hr
   - 6 hour electrolytes to reevaluate fluid hydration
   - Will increase free water boluses with tube feeds to 250 q4
   7. Tachycardia: Likely from alcoholic hepatitis
   - Trend, no BB indicated
   8. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   9. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Repeat afternoon Hct and transfuse as needed for less than 25
   - Hemolysis labs
   - PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who presented to the hospital after falling and experiencing a subdural hematoma. He was found to have alcoholic hepatitis and is currently in the ICU. His condition has been stable on repeat imaging. The patient's mental status is at baseline, and he is following commands but not completely oriented. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending downward, indicating ongoing liver damage. Nutritional support with enteral feeding is ongoing, and daily monitoring of LFTs and INR is recommended. 

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has pre-renal etiology combined with possible contrast-induced nephropathy. His creatinine levels are improving, but urine output is not significantly improving. Midodrine and octreotide should be restarted, and ACE inhibitors should be held. Medications should be adjusted for renal function, and daily monitoring of creatinine is advised.

3. Subdural Hematoma: The hematoma is stable on serial imaging, and immediate surgical intervention is not planned. Neurosurgery will follow the patient's condition daily while in the hospital, and serial neuro exams should be performed.

4. Confusion: The patient's confusion is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Additional considerations include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbances, and medications. Lact"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a large right subdural hematoma causing mass effect and mild subfalcine herniation. The patient has been tachycardic and received midodrine and octreotide, which were stopped. There has been a significant amount of free water administered, leading to an increase in sodium levels. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/55 mmHg to 127/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has increased from 92.4 kg at admission to 101 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,316 mL and total output of 2,025 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,291 mL. The patient is receiving fluids through the IVF and TF routes, with some blood products also being administered. The respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the patient's ABG results indicate normal values.

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct levels, and slightly elevated Plt count. The Cr levels are within normal range, while the TCO2, Glucose, and other lab values show fluctuations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.  He
   is at baseline mental status this morning following commands but not
   completely oriented.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis: Patient
s LFTs continue to trend downward.
   Feeding persists via doboff tube.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Liver recommendations appreciated re: Steroids
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pre-renal etiology combined with
   possible Contrast induced nephropathy.  Unlikely heptaorenal syndrome.
   Cr improving but urine output not significantly improving.
   - D/C midodrine, and octreotide
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Fluid hydration & free water.  Transfuse as needed
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   - D/C Keppra
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Acidosis
   Patient has both gap (18) and nongap acidosis. Nongap likely due to
   saline resuscitation +/- stool output. Renal failure may be
   contributory.
   - Check lactate given anion gap
   - Discontinue IVF
   7. Hypernatremia
   - Will increase free water boluses with tube feeds to 250 q4
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   8. Hypertension
   Bp currently under good control patient has not received BB recently
   - Hold atenolol and ACEI in setting of renal failure
   9. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   10. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - Keep type and screen active, transfuse hct>25
   - PPI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who presented to the emergency department following a fall. He was found to have alcoholic hepatitis and subsequently suffered a subdural hematoma after another fall. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 105/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals marked jaundice, scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, and bilateral lower extremity edema. His mental status is described as disoriented to time and place but able to answer questions and follow commands. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal renal function tests (creatinine). The patient's blood culture and urine culture both came back negative. 

The patient's current medications include haloperidol, midodrine, octreotide, and enteral feeding through a Dobhoff tube. 

The patient's medical history includes alcoholic hepatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, subdural hematoma, confusion (possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy), leukocytosis, acidosis (both gap and nongap), hypernatremia, hypertension, ethanol abuse, and anemia with a history of melena.

   1. Alcoholic hepatitis: Patient
s LFTs continue to trend downward.
   Feeding persists via doboff tube.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Liver recommendations appreciated re: Steroids
   - Will administer albumin today
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pre-renal etiology combined with
   possible Contrast induced nephropathy.  Unlikely heptaorenal syndrome.
   Cr improving but urine output not significantly improving.
   - Increase midodrine and octreotide
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   - Will get bladder pressure today
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~4.2 L with ongoing 100mL losses
   per hour in stool
   - Consult nutrition for minimum sodium feeds
   - Stopped D5W 200mL/hr overnight for precipitous drop in sodium
   - 6 hour electrolytes to reevaluate fluid hydration
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   7. Tachycardia: Likely from alcoholic hepatitis
   - Trend, no BB indicated
   8. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   9. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Repeat afternoon Hct and transfuse as needed for less than 25
   - Hemolysis labs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old alcoholic with a history of alcoholic hepatitis who presented to the emergency room after a fall and was found to have a subdural hematoma. The patient's current condition includes alcoholic hepatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, subdural hematoma, confusion (possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy), leukocytosis, hypernatremia, tachycardia, ethanol abuse, anemia with a history of melena, and other complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of alcoholic hepatitis, progression of renal failure, development of hepatic encephalopathy, further decline in mental status, infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and complications related to the subdural hematoma. The patient's airway patency may also be at risk due to their altered mental status and inability to protect their own airway.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, liver function tests, renal function, electrolyte levels, and mental status. Frequent assessment of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) is necessary. The healthcare team should also ensure proper nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate prophylactic measures to prevent infections. Regular communication and collaboration between the healthcare team members are essential for the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.  He
   is at baseline mental status this morning following commands but not
   completely oriented.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis: Patient
s LFTs continue to trend downward.
   Feeding persists via doboff tube.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Liver recommendations appreciated re: Steroids
   - Will administer albumin today
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pre-renal etiology combined with
   possible Contrast induced nephropathy.  Unlikely heptaorenal syndrome.
   Cr improving but urine output not significantly improving.
   - Increase midodrine and octreotide
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   - Will get bladder pressure today
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~4.2 L with ongoing 100mL losses
   per hour in stool
   - Consult nutrition for minimum sodium feeds
   - Stopped D5W 200mL/hr overnight for precipitous drop in sodium
   - 6 hour electrolytes to reevaluate fluid hydration
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   7. Tachycardia: Likely from alcoholic hepatitis
   - Trend, no BB indicated
   8. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   9. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Repeat afternoon Hct and transfuse as needed for less than 25-will
   receive 1 uPRBC today
   - Hemolysis labs
   - PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic hepatitis, renal failure, and subdural hemorrhage. The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, impaired airway protection, ineffective coping, hepatitis other, acute renal failure, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired knowledge, inability to manage money/personal finances, impaired motor function, impaired muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired skin integrity, liver function abnormalities, and potential complications such as liver cirrhosis. The patient is currently receiving nutritional support through tube feeds, insulin for glycemic control, and antibiotics for infection prophylaxis. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to his inability to protect his own airway. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to intubation and mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Infectious Complications: With impaired immune function, the patient is susceptible to various infections such as hospital-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
3. Hepatic Complications: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis, he may experience further liver damage, including hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
4. Renal Complications: Acute renal failure is already present in the patient, and it can worsen due to factors like hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular system may be compromised due to fluid imbalances, sepsis, or the effects of liver dysfunction on hemodynamics.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially considering his history of cirrhosis and potential varices.
7. Neurological Complications: With a previous subdural hemorrhage and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, the patient may continue to experience neurological deficits or further deterioration.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.  He
   is at baseline mental status this morning following commands but not
   completely oriented.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis: Patient
s LFTs continue to trend downward.
   Feeding persists via doboff tube.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Liver recommendations appreciated re: Steroids
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pre-renal etiology combined with
   possible Contrast induced nephropathy.  Unlikely heptaorenal syndrome.
   Cr improving but urine output not significantly improving.
   - Restart midodrine, and octreotide
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Fluid hydration & free water.
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~4.2 L with ongoing 100mL losses
   per hour in stool
   - Consult nutrition for minimum sodium feeds
   - D5W 200mL/hr
   - 6 hour electrolytes to reevaluate fluid hydration
   - Will increase free water boluses with tube feeds to 250 q4
   7. Tachycardia: Likely from alcoholic hepatitis
   - Trend, no BB indicated
   8. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   9. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Repeat afternoon Hct and transfuse as needed for less than 25
   - Hemolysis labs
   - PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old alcoholic with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, who presented to the ICU with a fall and subsequent subdural hematoma. The patient's current condition includes alcoholic hepatitis with improving liver function tests (LFTs), acute-on-chronic renal failure with pre-renal etiology and possible contrast-induced nephropathy, a stable subdural hematoma, confusion likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, leukocytosis possibly due to alcoholic hepatitis, hypernatremia with a free water deficit, tachycardia likely from alcoholic hepatitis, ethanol abuse, and anemia with a history of melena.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy due to alcoholic hepatitis. It is important to monitor for changes in mental status and avoid medications that can worsen hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with pre-renal etiology and possible contrast-induced nephropathy. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and measures should be taken to prevent further nephrotoxicity.
3. Subdural hematoma: Although the subdural hematoma is currently stable on serial imaging, it is important to continue monitoring the patient's neurological status and follow up with neurosurgery.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.  He
   is at baseline mental status this morning following commands but not
   completely oriented.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis: Patient
s LFTs continue to trend downward.
   Feeding persists via newly replaced dobhoff tube.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Will administer albumin today
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pre-renal etiology combined with
   possible Contrast induced nephropathy.  Unlikely heptaorenal syndrome.
   Cr improving but urine output not significantly improving. Bladder
   pressure 18
   - Increase midodrine and octreotide
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~2 L with ongoing  losses per hour
   in stool
   - Consult nutrition for minimum sodium feeds
   - Stopped D5W 200mL/hr overnight for precipitous drop in sodium
   - 6 hour electrolytes to reevaluate fluid hydration
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   7. Tachycardia: Likely from alcoholic hepatitis
   - Trend, no BB indicated
   8. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   9. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Repeat afternoon Hct and transfuse as needed for less than 25-will
   receive 1 uPRBC today
   - Hemolysis labs
   - PPI

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who presented to the emergency department following a fall. He was diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis and subsequently suffered a subdural hematoma, which is currently stable on repeat imaging. The patient's mental status is at baseline this morning, with him being able to follow commands but not completely oriented.

The patient's current medical conditions include alcoholic hepatitis, acute-on-chronic renal failure, subdural hematoma, confusion (likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy), leukocytosis (most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis), hypernatremia, tachycardia (likely from alcoholic hepatitis), ethanol abuse, and anemia with a history of melena.

The patient is receiving nutritional support via enteral feeding, and his liver function tests are trending downward. His creatinine level is improving but urine output is not significantly improving. He has increased midodrine and octreotide, and his bladder pressure is 18. Medications include fentanyl, insulin, haloperidol, and others.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 108/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on standby ventilator mode with a tidal volume of 734 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.  He
   is at baseline mental status this morning following commands but not
   completely oriented.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis: Patient
s LFTs continue to trend downward.
   Feeding persists via doboff tube.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Liver recommendations appreciated re: Steroids
   - Will administer albumin today
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pre-renal etiology combined with
   possible Contrast induced nephropathy.  Unlikely heptaorenal syndrome.
   Cr improving but urine output not significantly improving.
   - Increase midodrine and octreotide
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   - Will get bladder pressure today
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~4.2 L with ongoing 100mL losses
   per hour in stool
   - Consult nutrition for minimum sodium feeds
   - Stopped D5W 200mL/hr overnight for precipitous drop in sodium
   - 6 hour electrolytes to reevaluate fluid hydration
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   7. Tachycardia: Likely from alcoholic hepatitis
   - Trend, no BB indicated
   8. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   9. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Repeat afternoon Hct and transfuse as needed for less than 25-will
   receive 1 uPRBC today
   - Hemolysis labs
   - PPI

The patient is a 56-year-old alcoholic who presented to the hospital following a fall and was diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis. Subsequently, he suffered a subdural hematoma, which is currently stable on repeat imaging. The patient's mental status has improved since the previous day, as he is now able to follow commands but remains disoriented to time and place. 

The patient's laboratory results show worsening liver function tests, indicating ongoing liver damage. There are signs of acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal causes combined with contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient's urine output is not significantly improving, and bladder pressure is elevated at 18 mmHg. 

The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is at risk for withdrawal, but it is not currently being monitored using the CIWA scale. He also has anemia with a history of melena, but there has been no recent gross bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/41 to 126/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient is intubated and receiving comfort measures only (CMO) care. He has a tracheostomy tube in place, a PIV in the right arm, and a PICC line inserted. He is also"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral pulses, skin, or neurologic function. Lab results indicate abnormal kidney function, elevated liver enzymes, and impaired blood clotting. The patient also has high sodium and glucose levels. The patient's condition is worsening, with impaired airway protection, balance, motor function, and cognitive abilities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation and inability to protect the airway suggest a high risk for respiratory failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate potential renal dysfunction.
3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes suggest possible liver impairment.
4. Hyperglycemia: The consistently high glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia.
5. Hypotension: The low blood pressure may indicate inadequate organ perfusion and increased risk of organ damage.
6. Impaired Neurologic Function: The patient's impaired arousal, attention, cognition, balance, motor function, and impaired skin integrity suggest potential neurologic complications.
7. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/PTT and low platelet count indicate a bleeding risk due to impaired blood clotting.
8. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 56 year old alcoholic presented to an OSH following a fall and was
   found to have alcoholic hepatitis. Following a subsequent fall he
   suffered a subdural hematoma, currently stable on repeat imaging.  He
   is at baseline mental status this morning following commands but not
   completely oriented.
   1. Alcoholic hepatitis: Patient
s LFTs continue to trend downward.
   Feeding persists via newly replaced dobhoff tube.
   - Nutritional support with enteral feeding
   - Trend LFTs, INR daily
   - Will administer albumin today
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pre-renal etiology combined with
   possible Contrast induced nephropathy.  Unlikely heptaorenal syndrome.
   Cr improving but urine output not significantly improving. Bladder
   pressure 18
   - Increase midodrine and octreotide
   - Hold ACEI, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Follow Cr daily
   - Renal recommendations appreciated
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   3. Subdural hematoma
   Stable on serial imaging here. No immediate surgical intervention
   planned per neurosurgery.
   - Neurosurgery to follow daily while in hospital
   - Serial neuro exams
   4. Confusion
   Probably secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, additional considerations
   include subdural hematoma, electrolyte disturbance, meds.
   Wernicke/Korsakoff also consideration given EtoH history.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   - Avoid sedating meds
   5. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. No other signs/symptoms
   of infection. Overall, improved from admission.
   - Reculture if febrile, will hold off antibiotics at this time pending
   change in clinical status
   6. Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~2 L with ongoing  losses per hour
   in stool
   - Consult nutrition for minimum sodium feeds
   - Stopped D5W 200mL/hr overnight for precipitous drop in sodium
   - 6 hour electrolytes to reevaluate fluid hydration
   - Fluid hydration & free water per renal still has 2.3 L free water
   deficit, will increase free water boluses to 150 Q 4 hours
   7. Tachycardia: Likely from alcoholic hepatitis
   - Trend, no BB indicated
   8. EtoH abuse
   Patient out of window where at risk for EtoH withdrawal therefore not
   in need of CIWA scale monitor
   - Thiamine, folate, MVT
   - Social work consult
   9. Anemia with h/o melena
   No recent gross bleeding.
   - Repeat afternoon Hct and transfuse as needed for less than 25-will
   receive 1 uPRBC today
   - Hemolysis labs
   - PPI
