","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with cough and pleuritic chest pain, found to have left lower lobe pneumonia, and is now admitted to the MICU with acute hypoxia and respiratory distress. Her left lung is completely collapsed, which is new. The patient has known left lower lobe pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress has improved, but she still has a SpO2 of 91%. This indicates ongoing hypoxia. Further interventions such as repeat CXR, continuation of azithromycin and ceftriaxone for CAP, chest physiotherapy, nebulizers, and guaifenesin may be required to manage her respiratory condition.

2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has muddy brown casts suggestive of ATN, most likely due to ischemic prerenal failure or NSAID-induced ischemia. Measures should be taken to hold ASA and NSAIDs, avoid nephrotoxins, reneally dose medications, and continue home doxercalciferol for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

3. Low Bicarbonate: The patient has a low bicarbonate level, indicating acute metabolic acidosis secondary to ATN. Close monitoring of calcium"

The patient has known left lower lobe pneumonia and complete opacification of her left lung, indicating a possible complication related to mucous plugging from secretions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with acute hypoxia and respiratory distress, which could be due to mucous plugging from secretions causing complete opacification of her left lung. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory support is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Muddy Brown Urinary Casts: The patient's lab results show muddy brown casts in the urine, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). ATN can occur due to ischemic or nephrotoxic causes. In this case, it is likely ischemic from prerenal failure or NSAID-induced ischemia. Appropriate measures should be taken to avoid nephrotoxins, hold aspirin and NSAIDs, and ensure renally-dosed medications.

3. Low Bicarbonate Levels: The patient's lab results indicate low bicarbonate levels, suggesting an acute metabolic acidosis. This could be secondary to the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of hypertension (HTN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4. She was initially admitted with cough and pleuritic chest pain, and was found to have left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. The patient's respiratory distress improved after being admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). She has complete opacification of her left lung due to a mucus plug.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely related to mucous plugging from secretions. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 4: The patient has CKD stage 4, which can increase the risk of complications such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management of fluid and electrolyte balance is crucial.

3. Acute Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has low bicarbonate levels, indicating acute metabolic acidosis. Regular monitoring of acid-base balance and repletion of calcium and potassium as needed is essential.

4. Hypertension: Although somewhat better controlled, the patient's hypertension requires continued management to prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.

5. Weakness: The patient endorses weakness, which may be attributed to her recent illness and deconditioning. Physical therapy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 4. She was initially admitted with cough and pleuritic chest pain, and found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She was transferred to the MICU due to acute hypoxemia caused by a mucus plug leading to complete left lung atelectasis.

The patient remains stable on nasal cannula oxygen and is receiving aggressive chest physical therapy, including bronchoscopy, acapella, percussion vest, cough assist device, mucomyst, and bronchodilators. Her CXR shows persistent left lung atelectasis, but the patient is clinically stable and amenable to repeat bronchoscopy if necessary.

The patient's medications include ceftriaxone, diltiazem, heparin sodium, synthroid, simvastatin, tramadol, and Tylenol as needed. She has allergies to ampicillin, codeine, and tetracyclines. Her last doses of antibiotics were azithromycin on 12/21/2127 at 08:20 AM and ceftriaxone on 12/22/2127 at 12:08 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature range of 35.8-36.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/65 mmHg to 162/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of mucus plug and complete left lung atelectasis.

Fluid balance shows an input of 860 mL since 29 AM, output of 1160 mL including 415 mL of urine, resulting in a negative balance of 300 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivered through a nasal cannula. Her ABG results show a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 21 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress, with symmetric chest expansion and bronchial breath sounds on the left lung. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema absent. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, leukocyte count of 325 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 90 mg/dL, creatinine of 3.6 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, glucose of 87 mg/dL, and calcium of 7.7 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, with values of 9.0, 8"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 4. She was initially admitted for cough and pleuritic chest pain and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She is now admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to acute hypoxemia caused by a mucus plug and complete left lung atelectasis.

The patient remains with left lung atelectasis despite bronchoscopy and aggressive chest physical therapy. She is receiving supplemental oxygen to maintain an oxygen saturation level above 90%. The chest X-ray shows persistent left lung atelectasis, but the patient is clinically stable. The healthcare team is considering a repeat bronchoscopy if absolutely necessary.

The patient also has muddy brown casts suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), most likely from prerenal failure versus NSAID-induced ischemia. Measures are being taken to hold aspirin and NSAIDs, avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications, and continue home doxercalciferol for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be changed to nothing by mouth (npo) for now. Glycemic control is being maintained with the Racial and Ethnic Standards for Diabetes (RISS) protocol. The patient has an 18-gauge peripheral IV line placed on 12/19/27 at 10:51 AM for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis is not indicated.

The patient's code status is full code, and she will remain in the ICU until a decision is made regarding a plan for bronchoscopy. The total time spent with the patient is 25 minutes."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypoxia and respiratory distress due to left lower lobe pneumonia. She has shown improvement in her respiratory status with aggressive chest physiotherapy.

The patient has allergies to ampicillin, codeine, and tetracyclines. She received azithromycin and ceftriaxone antibiotics in the past. She is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.3째C (97.4째F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/62 to 163/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities. Her neurologic examination is normal, but her peripheral pulses are not assessed. Her breath sounds are diminished on the right side.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values, including electrolytes and blood glucose, are within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with acute hypoxia and respiratory distress due to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved with aggressive chest physiotherapy, but there is still complete opacification of her left lung. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience further respiratory distress due to mucous plugging from secretions in the setting of known left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. Aggressive chest physiotherapy is recommended, and if necessary, brief intubation may be required.

2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has muddy brown casts suggestive of ATN, most likely ischemic from prerenal failure or NSAID-induced ischemia. Measures should be taken to avoid nephrotoxins, hold aspirin and NSAIDs, and renally dose medications.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has low bicarbonate levels, indicating an acute metabolic acidosis secondary to ATN. Close monitoring of calcium and potassium levels is advised, and bicarbonate supplementation should be continued.

4. Hypertension: Although somewhat better controlled, the patient's hypertension requires continued management. Consideration should be given to extended-release diltiaz"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with cough and pleuritic chest pain, found to have left lower lobe pneumonia, and underwent a repeat bronchoscopy with removal of a large mucus plug. The patient has shown significant improvement in both clinical and radiographic findings after the bronchoscopic procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with acute hypoxia and respiratory distress due to a mucus plug in the left lung. Although she has shown improvement, there is a risk of recurrence if further obstructions or infections occur.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The presence of muddy brown casts in the urine suggests ATN, which could be caused by ischemic or nephrotoxic factors. It is important to avoid nephrotoxins, hold ASA and NSAIDs, and provide renal dose medications.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has low bicarbonate levels indicating an acute metabolic acidosis. Close monitoring of electrolytes such as calcium and potassium is necessary, and bicarbonate supplementation should be continued.
4. Hypertension: Although somewhat better controlled, the patient's hypertension still requires ongoing management, considering extended-release formulations of diltiazem.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted with cough and pleuritic chest pain, found to have left lower lobe pneumonia, and subsequently admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to acute hypoxia and respiratory distress. She underwent a repeat bronchoscopy with removal of a large mucus plug. The patient's oxygenation improved both clinically and radiographically after the bronchoscopy. She completed a 5-day course of azithromycin and is currently on various medications including bronchodilators, guaifenesin, mucomyst inhalers, and renal recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with acute hypoxia and respiratory distress due to pneumonia. Although she showed improvement after the bronchoscopy, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory distress or complications related to her underlying chronic kidney disease.

2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The muddy brown casts in her urine suggest ATN, which can be caused by ischemic or nephrotoxic factors. It is essential to avoid nephrotoxins, hold NSAIDs, and provide appropriate renal dosing of medications.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has low bicarbonate levels, indicating metabolic acidosis. This could be due to an acute condition, possibly related to her recent illness. Close monitoring of electrolytes, particularly calcium and potassium, is necessary, and bicarbonate supplementation should be continued.

4. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure has shown somewhat better control, it is crucial to continue monitoring and managing her hypertension to prevent complications.

5. Weakness: The patient reports weakness and lack of appetite, which could be attributed to her recent illness and possible deconditioning. A physical therapy consult and rehabilitation stay may be beneficial for her recovery.

6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels should be closely monitored and treated accordingly.

7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia should be managed with ongoing treatment and medication.

8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism should be continued on levothyroxine.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."
