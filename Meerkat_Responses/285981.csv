   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH of ESRD presenting with sepsis physiology,
   on pressors.
   .
   #1 sepsis: Most likely source is HD catheter which was removed
   yesterday.  Other possible sources include urine (positive UA), and,
   less likely, cellulitis.  2 BCx from [**10-19**] w/Staph aureus. Repeat BCx
   sent and pending, UCx pending. Catheter tip culture pending.  Currently
   requiring levophed, but weaning.
   - vanc, cefepime, ciprofloxacin
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP goal > 20 -> continue to wean levophed as
   tolerated
   - currently no respiratory compromise
   - CVP above goal, avoid further IVF if possible given ESRD on HD
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   .
   #2 ESRD: s/p HD 2d ago.  Has received IVF for pressure, electrolytes
   remain wnl. Now w/no HD access
   - for temporary HD catheter by IR and +/- dialysis tomorrow based on
   pressure/electrolytes
   - follow pm lytes
   .
   #3 anemia: below baseline. Mildly guaiac positive stool, not grossly
   bloody. Hct improving.
   - follow HCT
   - cont guaiac stools
   #4 hypercoaguability: Coumadin d/c since admission. Increasing INR,
   likely due to delayed effects of coumadin, interaction with
   antibiotics, low urine output due to ESRD.  INR now to 4.4 from 2.8
   yesterday. Needs HD access, better IV access (now with femoral line 48h
   old), needs INR to be higher for procedures to be done.
   - Vitamin K today
   - re-check INR in pm, tomorrow am
   #5 Access: Patient with femoral central line from ED ([**10-19**]), has been
   in approx 48 hours.  Do not want to place central line in
   neck/subclavian b/c L side needed for HD catheter. Should have PICC but
   concerns b/c of positive BCx and high INR.  D/W IR, who will place a
   picc tomorrow in IR
   .
   #6 afib, tachy-brady: s/p ppm. Afib with normal rate on EKG. s/p

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with sepsis physiology and is currently on pressors. The most likely source of sepsis is the hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed yesterday. Other possible sources include urine (positive urinalysis) and cellulitis. Blood cultures from October 19th showed Staphylococcus aureus, but sensitivities are pending. The patient requires levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and is being weaned off levophed. She also has anemia, hypercoagulability, access issues, atrial fibrillation with tachy-brady syndrome, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, most likely due to the HD catheter. There is a possibility of infection spreading to other areas of the body if not properly managed.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are below baseline, indicating anemia. If left untreated, this can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
3. Hypercoagulability: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a hypercoagulable state. This increases the risk of blood clots forming, which can lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
4. Access issues"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with sepsis physiology and is currently on pressors. She has been receiving hemodialysis (HD) and has had her dialysis catheter removed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/45 to 129/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals mild erythema on the right lower extremity compared to the left. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination is not assessed. Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 16.0 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 30 mg/dL, and decreased sodium level of 136 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis, with potential sources including a urinary tract infection (positive urine analysis), possibly the hemodialysis catheter, and less likely cellulitis. She is currently requiring one pressor (levophed).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted with sepsis. She has had continued requirements for pressors, impressive positive cultures, and transient hypoxemia. The presence of Acute Lung Injury and hydrostatic pulmonary edema is concerning. The patient's blood cultures show Staphylococcus aureus, and she is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) SHOCK, SEPTIC: The patient has significant blood culture findings of S. Aureus. She is receiving treatment with ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. The team plans to wean Levophed and move to trial PICC therapy for dosing of pressors. A central access will be maintained to preserve the left side for dialysis catheter placement.

2) Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's goal is to have HD catheter placement tomorrow and begin hemodialysis. Electrolytes and acid-base status are reasonable at this time, and monitoring will continue.

3) Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR due to antibiotic administration. Vitamin K will be given to correct the INR, and FFP will be provided as needed during renal line placement. Vitamin K will also be given today.

ICU Care:
The patient will advance to a po diet with good tolerance of clears. Glycemic control will be maintained"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH of ESRD presenting with sepsis physiology,
   on pressors.
   .
   #1 sepsis: Most likely source is HD catheter which was removed
   yesterday.  Other possible sources include urine (positive UA), and,
   less likely, cellulitis.  2 BCx from [**10-19**] w/Staph aureus. Repeat BCx
   sent and pending, UCx pending. Catheter tip culture pending.  Currently
   requiring levophed, but weaning.
   - vanc, cefepime, ciprofloxacin
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP goal > 20 -> continue to wean levophed as
   tolerated
   - currently no respiratory compromise
   - CVP above goal, avoid further IVF if possible given ESRD on HD
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   .
   #2 ESRD: s/p HD 2d ago.  Has received IVF for pressure, electrolytes
   remain wnl. Now w/no HD access
   - for temporary HD catheter by IR and +/- dialysis tomorrow based on
   pressure/electrolytes
   - follow pm lytes
   .
   #3 anemia: below baseline. Mildly guaiac positive stool, not grossly
   bloody. Hct improving.
   - follow HCT
   - cont guaiac stools
   #4 hypercoaguability: Coumadin d/c since admission. Increasing INR,
   likely due to delayed effects of coumadin, interaction with
   antibiotics, low urine output due to ESRD.  INR now to 4.4 from 2.8
   yesterday. Needs HD access, better IV access (now with femoral line 48h
   old), needs INR to be higher for procedures to be done.
   - Vitamin K today
   - re-check INR in pm, tomorrow am
   #5 Access: Patient with femoral central line from ED ([**10-19**]), has been
   in approx 48 hours.  Do not want to place central line in
   neck/subclavian b/c L side needed for HD catheter. Should have PICC but
   concerns b/c of positive BCx and high INR.  D/W IR, who will place a
   picc tomorrow in IR
   .
   #6 afib, tachy-brady: s/p ppm. Afib with normal rate on EKG. s/p
   pacemaker.
   - holding metoprolol while septic
   - hypercoaguable now so Coumadin held.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with sepsis physiology and is currently on pressors. The patient has multiple medical complications that require ongoing management.

1. Sepsis: The likely source of sepsis is the hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed yesterday. Other possible sources include urine (positive urine analysis) and cellulitis. The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, and cultures are pending.

2. ESRD: The patient recently underwent HD and is receiving IV fluids for pressure management. Electrolytes are within normal limits, but the patient needs temporary HD access for further dialysis.

3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is below baseline, and there is mild guaiac-positive stool, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it is not grossly bloody. The patient's HCT is improving, and further evaluation of the gastrointestinal bleeding should be conducted.

4. Hypercoagulability: The patient's INR is elevated due to delayed effects of Coumadin, antibiotic interactions, and low urine output caused by ESRD. Vitamin K has been administered, and the INR will be rechecked in the evening and tomorrow morning.

5. Access: The patient has a femoral central line that has been in place for approximately 48 hours. A PICC line is planned for tomorrow due to concerns about the positive"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH of ESRD presenting with sepsis physiology,
   on pressors.
   .
   #1 Sepsis: Most likely source is HD catheter which was removed
   yesterday.  Tip now growing staph aureus and 2BCx from [**10-19**] MRSA.  BC
   from [**10-20**] are positive for GPCs .   UCx pending.  Currently still
   requiring levophed.
   - vanc, cefepime, stop cipro today
   - abx day #1 for vanc, cefepime = [**2184-10-19**]
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP goal > 20 -> continue to wean levophed as
   tolerated
   - currently no respiratory compromise
   - CVP above goal, avoid further IVF if possible given ESRD on HD
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   .
   #2 ESRD: s/p HD 2d ago.  Has received IVF for pressure, electrolytes
   remain wnl.  Needs dialysis today.  Now w/no HD access
   - f/u with renal and IR for temporary HD line placed today with
   dialysis later today.
   .
   #3 anemia: below baseline. Mildly guaiac positive stool, not grossly
   bloody. Hct improving.
   - follow HCT
   - cont guaiac stools
   #4 hypercoaguability: Coumadin d/c since admission. Increasing INR,
   likely due to delayed effects of coumadin, interaction with
   antibiotics, low urine output due to ESRD.  INR was 4.4 yesterday, now
   2.2.
   - f/u with IR regarding procedure today
   #5 Access: Patient with femoral central line from ED ([**10-19**]), has been
   in approx 48 hours.  Do not want to place central line in
   neck/subclavian b/c L side needed for HD catheter.
   - PICC line to be placed by IR today
   .
   #6 afib, tachy-brady: s/p ppm. Afib with normal rate on EKG. s/p
   pacemaker.
   - holding metoprolol while septic
   - hypercoaguable now so Coumadin held.

","The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presenting with sepsis physiology and requiring vasopressors. The likely source of sepsis is the hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed yesterday. Cultures from the catheter tip are positive for Staphylococcus aureus and 2BCx, indicating MRSA. Blood cultures from [**10-20**] are positive for gram-positive cocci (GPCs). The patient remains on levophed, and the goal is to wean it as tolerated.

The patient has ESRD and received HD two days ago. She has received intravenous fluids (IVF) for pressure, and electrolytes remain within normal limits. However, she needs dialysis today, but currently has no HD access. A temporary HD line will be placed today with dialysis scheduled for later today.

The patient's HCT (hematocrit) is below baseline, and there is mild guaiac-positive stool, although not grossly bloody. The anemia is improving. It is recommended to follow HCT levels and continue guaiac stool monitoring.

The patient has hypercoagulability, likely due to delayed effects of Coumadin, antibiotic interactions, and low urine output secondary to ESRD. INR was 4.4 yesterday but is now 2.2. It is important to follow up with interventional radiology"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with sepsis physiology and is currently requiring norepinephrine (Levophed) support. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions that require ongoing management.

1. Sepsis: The patient's most likely source of sepsis is the hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed yesterday. Other possible sources include the urine (positive urine analysis) and cellulitis. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The plan is to continue weaning off the Levophed as tolerated.

2. ESRD: The patient underwent hemodialysis two days ago and received intravenous fluids for pressure control. Electrolytes are within normal limits. Temporary HD catheter placement is planned by interventional radiology (IR) for tomorrow's dialysis, based on pressure and electrolyte levels.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is below baseline, and there is a mildly positive guaiac test indicating the presence of blood in the stool, although it is not grossly bloody. The Hct is improving, and further follow-up is needed.

4. Hypercoagulability: The patient has an elevated INR due to delayed effects of Coumadin, antibiotic interactions, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH of ESRD presenting with sepsis physiology,
   on pressors.
   .
   #1 Sepsis: Most likely source is HD catheter which was removed
   yesterday.  Tip now growing staph aureus and 2BCx from [**10-19**] MRSA.  BC
   from [**10-20**] are positive for GPCs .   UCx pending.  Currently still
   requiring levophed.
   - vanc, cefepime, stop cipro today
   - abx day #1 for vanc, cefepime = [**2184-10-19**]
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP goal > 20 -> continue to wean levophed as
   tolerated
   - currently no respiratory compromise
   - CVP above goal, avoid further IVF if possible given ESRD on HD
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   .
   #2 ESRD: s/p HD 2d ago.  Has received IVF for pressure, electrolytes
   remain wnl.  Needs dialysis today.  Now w/no HD access
   - f/u with renal and IR for temporary HD line placed today with
   dialysis later today.
   .
   #3 anemia: below baseline. Mildly guaiac positive stool, not grossly
   bloody. Hct improving.
   - follow HCT
   - cont guaiac stools
   #4 hypercoaguability: Coumadin d/c since admission. Increasing INR,
   likely due to delayed effects of coumadin, interaction with
   antibiotics, low urine output due to ESRD.  INR was 4.4 yesterday, now
   2.2.
   - f/u with IR regarding procedure today
   #5 Access: Patient with femoral central line from ED ([**10-19**]), has been
   in approx 48 hours.  Do not want to place central line in
   neck/subclavian b/c L side needed for HD catheter.
   - PICC line to be placed by IR today
   .
   #6 afib, tachy-brady: s/p ppm. Afib with normal rate on EKG. s/p
   pacemaker.
   - holding metoprolol while septic
   - hypercoaguable now so Coumadin held.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently in the ICU. She presents with sepsis physiology and is on pressors. Her labs show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The patient has multiple medical issues including sepsis, ESRD, anemia, hypercoagulability, access problems, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and malnutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to a central line infection, and there is a risk of further complications if the infection spreads.
2. ESRD: The patient's kidney failure requires dialysis, and the temporary HD catheter placement is necessary. There is a risk of complications related to the access site and the dialysis procedure itself.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which can lead to complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and increased risk of infection.
4. Hypercoagulability: The patient's increased INR suggests a hypercoagulable state, which can increase the risk of blood clots. This could lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Access issues: The patient's femoral central line needs to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of renal failure who has been admitted to the ICU. She presents with sepsis and a clear catheter-related bloodstream infection. The patient requires persistent pressor support despite antibiotics and fluids being administered. She also exhibits significant hypoxemia and peripheral edema, limiting further extensive fluid loading in the setting of sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for a catheter-related bloodstream infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Cefepime/Cipro) covering both pulmonary and urinary tract infections. The need to establish safe and optimal access for long-term treatment is crucial.
2. Coagulopathy: Vitamin K has been given to the patient, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be administered today to control residual INR issues during peri-procedure periods. Efforts will be made to minimize the risk of bleeding during procedures.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: Temporary hemodialysis will be initiated today to manage additional issues as defined in the resident note of this date.
4. Dyspnea (Shortness of Breath): The patient's impaired oxygenation may lead to further episodes of dyspnea.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may worsen due to prolonged immobility and pressure ulcers.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may continue to be altered due to sepsis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with sepsis physiology and required pressor support. She has multiple medical conditions including altered mental status, anemia, hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and fluid electrolyte imbalance. The patient underwent various procedures such as the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter, PICC line, and arterial line. She is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, cefepime, and levothyroxine. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but she remains critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Kidney Injury: Given her ESRD and recent hemodialysis, there is a risk of worsening renal function or acute kidney injury.
3. Cardiovascular Events: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension increases her risk for cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
4. Bleeding: Due to her altered coagulation profile and the use of anticoagulant medications, the patient is at risk for bleeding complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with sepsis physiology and is currently on pressors. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including sepsis, likely originating from her hemodialysis (HD) catheter, ESRD requiring HD, anemia, hypercoagulability, access issues for HD, atrial fibrillation with tachy-brady syndrome, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and familial hypertriglyceridemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/55 mmHg to 176/173 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is currently receiving norepinephrine infusion and has a central venous pressure (CVP) above goal.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased creatinine, low calcium and magnesium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's treatment plan includes stopping ciprofloxacin, continuing vancomycin and cefepime, weaning off levophed, removing the HD catheter due to tip colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA, placing a temporary HD line, and initiating dialysis today. The patient also requires close"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea, which is consistent with their history of altered mental status and sepsis. The note indicates that the family believes the patient's altered mental status is due to a lack of dialysis rather than Zyprexa, so the medication has been held.

The patient has several allergies to medications including penicillins, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 10/20/2184 at 7:00 PM, cefepime on 10/21/2184 at 10:00 PM, and ceftriaxone on 10/22/2184 at 11:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), a heart rate of 76 bpm with an atrial fibrillation rhythm, a blood pressure of 123/55 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 985 mL and an output of 140 mL in urine and 40 mL in drains, resulting in a balance of 845 mL. The patient is receiving fluids intravenously and has not been assessed for peripheral vascular pulses, skin condition, or neurologic status.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels are also elevated. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal ranges.

The patient's diagnosis includes dyspnea, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, septic shock, urinary tract infection, and possibly respiratory failure based on the use of a face tent for oxygen delivery.

The patient is receiving various ICU interventions such as arterial and PICC line placement, dialysis catheter insertion, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   rousable.  She received fentanyl 25 mg IV yesterday with her catheter
   placement.  Its effect may be prolonged secondary to renal failure.
   Will continue to monitor mental status.  No diet currently.
   #4 anemia: below baseline. Mildly guaiac positive stool, not grossly
   bloody. Hct improving.
   - follow HCT
   - cont guaiac stools
   #5 hypercoaguability: Coumadin d/c since admission.  Vitamin K given
   [**10-22**] to reverse INR for catheter placement.  INR now 1.6.
   - cont. to monitor INR
   - will hold coumadin for now given potential need for repeat procedure
   - will not start heparin gtt given low risk for stroke within the next
   few days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and multiple comorbidities. She presented with sepsis, most likely originating from her hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was subsequently removed. The patient is currently on norepinephrine for blood pressure support and various antibiotics. She also has altered mental status, anemia, hypercoagulability, access issues, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and fluid/electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: There is a high risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and recent removal of the HD catheter. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
2. Bleeding: The patient's INR is elevated due to vitamin K administration for catheter placement and Coumadin discontinuation. Close monitoring of INR is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of ESRD and is on HD, indicating chronic fluid management issues. Careful monitoring of fluid balance and avoidance of further IV fluid administration if possible are recommended.
4. Renal function: The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by her ESRD and repeated HD sessions. Continued monitoring of renal parameters and adherence to the planned HD schedule are crucial.
5. Delirium: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with sepsis physiology. She has been weaned off pressors and is currently on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis. The likely source of infection is the hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed and the tip tested positive for MRSA. The patient has also had two blood cultures from different sites that were positive for MRSA. Other cultures are negative so far. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she will have her arterial line pulled today. An echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis. The patient has been on peritoneal dialysis and is now starting permanent HD due to continued negative blood cultures. She has altered mental status, which is likely due to sepsis, ESRD, and ICU delirium with baseline dementia. Her anemia is below baseline, and she has mildly guaiac positive stool. Her coagulation status is hypercoagulable, and she received vitamin K to reverse INR for catheter placement. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker was placed. She has gout in her toe, and her thyroid function is hypothyroid. Her blood pressure is controlled with medication, and she is on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. Her electrolytes are replete as needed, and she is on a bowel regimen. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is stable for the floor."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and several other comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis physiology, likely originating from her hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed. The patient's HD catheter tip and blood cultures from October 19th tested positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and subsequent blood cultures from October 20th also confirmed MRSA.

The patient has been weaned off pressors, indicating improvement in her hemodynamic status. However, she continues to experience altered mental status, which fluctuates and is likely attributed to sepsis, ESRD, and ICU delirium with baseline dementia. Her Hct (hematocrit) is improving, indicating anemia management.

Other ongoing issues include hypercoagulability, access problems, toe pain possibly due to gout, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, and she is expected to be appropriate for floor disposition soon. She has had several lines placed, including an arterial line, PICC line, and dialysis catheter. Nutrition and glycemic control are being monitored, and prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently in the ICU. She presented with sepsis physiology and is on pressors. The likely source of sepsis is the hemodialysis (HD) catheter, which was removed and showed MRSA growth. She also has positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 95/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented to person but not time or place. Physical examination findings include mild erythema on the right lower extremity and swelling on the dorsal aspect of the right arm, where the PICC line is placed. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate level. The patient has multiple medical conditions including sepsis, ESRD requiring HD, altered mental status, anemia, hypercoagulability, access issues, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and potential feeding tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing sepsis likely due to the MRSA infection from the HD catheter. There is a risk of progression to septic shock and multiple"

   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with PMH of ESRD presenting with sepsis physiology,
   on pressors.
   .
   #1 Sepsis: Most likely source is HD catheter which was removed.  Tip
   and 2BCx from [**10-19**] are MRSA.  BC from [**10-20**] are positive for GPCs .
   Currently still requiring minimal levophed for BP support.
   - continue Vanc (dosed after HD)
   - abx day #1 for vanc, = [**2184-10-19**]
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP goal > 20 -> continue to wean levophed as
   tolerated
   - CVP above goal, avoid further IVF if possible given ESRD on HD
   - f/u cultures and sensitivities
   - ECHO to check for endocarditis
   .
   #2 ESRD: s/p HD [**10-22**]
   - plan for repeat HD today, then [**10-26**]
   - f/u with renal
   .
   #3 Altered mental status: Waxes and wanes, likely contributing factors
   are sepsis, ESRD and ICU delirium with baseline dementia.
   #4 anemia: below baseline. Mildly guaiac positive stool, not grossly
   bloody. Hct improving.
   - follow HCT
   - cont guaiac stools
   #5 hypercoaguability: Was on Coumadin for afib. Coumadin d/c since
   admission.  Vitamin K given [**10-22**] to reverse INR for catheter
   placement.  INR now 1.6.
   - cont. to monitor INR
   - will hold coumadin for now given potential need for repeat procedure
   - will not start heparin gtt given low risk for stroke within the next
   few days.
   #6 Access:
   - PICC line placed by IR, temporary HD catheter in place
   - will need permanent HD catheter this week
   - fem line removed
   .
   #7 afib, tachy-brady: s/p ppm. Afib with normal rate on EKG. s/p
   pacemaker.
   - holding metoprolol while septic

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 96-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with sepsis physiology and is currently on pressors.
- She has been experiencing increased pain in her right foot/toe and had an aspiration event during dinner, resulting in a change to NPO status and an order for a chest X-ray.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of alertness and confusion.
- She has a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, hypercoagulability, anemia, altered mental status, and hypothyroidism.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 95/34 mmHg and a heart rate of 64 bpm.
- She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiac support.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, while her hemoglobin and platelet count are low.
- She has a positive blood culture for MRSA and gram-positive cocci.
- The patient requires ongoing management for her sepsis, ESRD, altered mental status, anemia, hypercoagulability, and access issues.
- There are plans for repeat hemodialysis, monitoring of INR, and further evaluation for endocarditis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, admitted with MRSA line sepsis of the hemodialysis line. She had an aspiration event yesterday and has improved since then. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, MRSA bacteremia/sepsis, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and toe inflammation likely due to gout. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 91/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vitamins, and cardiac support. Her recent blood cultures have been negative. She will be undergoing tunnel catheter placement for hemodialysis and continuing vancomycin for MRSA infection. The plan includes restarting warfarin for atrial fibrillation in the future and evaluating for toe inflammation. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor once stable."
