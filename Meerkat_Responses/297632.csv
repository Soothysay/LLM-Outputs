   # Hypercarbia: Patient smoker, mild apically predominant emphysema with
   recent spirometry suggesting mild obstructive ventilatory defect.
   However patient's prior gases do not suggest overwhelming chronic
   retainer. Patient on multiple sedating medications and positive
   barbituates on tox screen. Patient could be hypoventilating due to
   narcotics resulting in retention. No history of OSA. No paradoxical
   abdominal movement to suggest diaphargm paralysis. Most recent gas also
   demontrates hypoxia, could be from hypoventilation, bilateral
   atelactasis and underlying COPD. Carboxyhemoglobin within level of
   smoker. Methemoglobin level 0, which has been tested prior due to prior
   poor correlation of sats.   Pt. mental status became more alert after
   naloxone.  Now saturating well, could consider another dose of
   naloxone, but would not necessarily want to completely reverse her.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of Sjoren's disease, diabetes mellitus, presenting with hypoxia, nausea, and dysuria.
- She was found to be somnolent and hypercarbic of unclear etiology.
- The patient is a smoker with mild apically predominant emphysema and recent spirometry suggesting mild obstructive ventilatory defect.
- She is on multiple sedating medications and positive barbiturates on tox screen.
- Her mental status became more alert after naloxone administration.
- She has a decreased level of consciousness, decreased breath sounds, and mild TTP in the lower quadrants.
- She has clubbing present, pulses intact, and responds to voice, arousable but sleepy.
- Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, elevated potassium levels, and other abnormal values.
- Assessment and plan include hypercarbia, urinary tract infection versus pyelonephritis, urinary retention, depression/anxiety, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, Sjogren's, diabetes, chronic pain, and medication management.
- Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status due to hypoventilation or bilateral atelectasis, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, and potential abscess formation if urinary retention persists.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a medical history of Sjoren's disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and depression/anxiety. She presents with nausea and left flank pain for 6 days duration. The patient was found to be somnolent and hypercarbic of unclear etiology. The assessment indicates that the patient could be hypoventilating due to narcotics resulting in retention, or it could be caused by bilateral atelectasis and underlying COPD. Carboxyhemoglobin level is within the range expected for a smoker, and methemoglobin level is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbia: The patient has high levels of carbon dioxide in her blood, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly.
2. Urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis: The patient's symptoms of nausea and flank pain are consistent with a urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis. If left untreated, it can progress to severe kidney infection and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, but there is a mention of unclear whether the patient is taking clonidine, a medication used to treat hypertension. If the patient is not taking clonidine, there is a risk of uncontrolled hypertension in the future.
4. Diabetes management: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and insulin sliding"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a medical history of Sjoren's syndrome, diabetes mellitus, who presented with nausea and left flank pain for 6 days. The patient was found to be somnolent and hypercarbic of unclear etiology. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbia: The patient is a smoker with mild apically predominant emphysema. She is on multiple sedating medications, including barbiturates, which may contribute to hypoventilation. No history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is reported. Most recent gas demonstrates hypoxia, which could be due to hypoventilation, bilateral atelectasis, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Carboxyhemoglobin levels are within the range expected for a smoker, and methemoglobin level is normal. Naloxone has improved the patient's mental status, suggesting opioid-induced respiratory depression. The goal for oxygen saturation is 88-92%. High flow oxygen therapy and non-rebreather mask (NRB) are recommended. Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) in 3-16 hours, hold all sedating medications, consider bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) if mental status worsens, and consult rheumatology for pain management.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 y/o F Sjoren's, DM who presents with nausea and left flack pain for
   6 days duration. Patient found to be somnolent and hypercarbic of
   unclear etiology.
   # Hypercarbia: Patient smoker, mild apically predominant emphysema with
   recent spirometry suggesting mild obstructive ventilatory defect.
   However patient's prior gases do not suggest overwhelming chronic
   retainer. Patient on multiple sedating medications and positive
   barbituates on tox screen. Patient could be hypoventilating due to
   narcotics resulting in retention. PCP has low concern for abuse
   although increased trazodone/buspar added, recent increase in
   oxycodone.  Per PCP she has refused home inspection/monitorNo history
   of OSA. No paradoxical abdominal movement to suggest diaphragm
   paralysis. Most recent gas shows PaO2 that does not seem to correlate
   with O2 sats (would epect sat to be higher). Carboxyhemoglobin was 11
   on presentation. Methemoglobin level 0.   Pt. mental status became more
   alert after naloxone.  Now 86-92% on RA
   - Sa O2 goal 88-92%
   - Repeat full panel on gas (carboxyhemoglobin/metheme/etc.)
   - Carboxyhemoglobin washout with O 2 to sats >92%
   - Hold all sedating medications
   - Consider BiPap if mental status worsens
   - f/u social work consult
   - f/u rheum recs
   - talk to husband to arrange CO monitoring and testing at the house
   - f/u ECHO
   - repeat CXR
   # Nausea, flank pain: Most consistent with urinary tract infection
   versus pyelonephritis. CTA ab/pelvis negative for ischemia or other
   acute abnormality.   Pt. has been straight cathing at home recently.
   Now voiding on her own, neuro exam was improved on repeat exam [**4-11**], so
   MRI spine was not done although it had been considered.
   - Follow urine culture
   # Urinary Retention:  Patient recently started self cathing at home.
   Possible etiologies include narcotic use.  Based on immunosuppression
   could have abscess. Now voiding on her own, neuro exam was improved on
   repeat exam [**4-11**], so MRI spine was not done although it had been
   considered
   - continue to monitor
   # Depression/Anxiety: Continue Lexapro 20 mg qd.  Could be component of
   narcotic/nicotine withdrawal.
   - Hold Buspirone as sedating
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 40 mg qd.
   # Hypertension: Unclear whether patient is taking clonidine. PCP seemed
   to have been wanting to taper her off this.
   -Start norvasc.
   # Sjogren's: Continue prednisone 10 mg qd.
   # Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale while in house.
   # Chronic pain: Hold outpatient sedating medications.
   # Med Rec: Touched base with husband and PCP and prior notes regarding
   medication administration.
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF, replete electrolytes, diabetic diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin. Continue outpatient Ranitidine.

PCP has low concern for abuse, although there has been an increase in oxycodone. The patient's mental status improved after naloxone administration. Her oxygen saturation goal is 88-92%, and she should undergo repeat full panel gas analysis, carboxyhemoglobin washout with O2 to sats >92%, and hold all sedating medications. Consider BiPap if mental status worsens, f/u social work consult, f/u rheum recs, talk to husband to arrange CO monitoring and testing at the house, f/u ECHO, and repeat CXR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbia: The patient may have hypercarbia due to hypoventilation caused by narcotics or other factors. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood.
2. Methemoglobin"
