   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10471**] is an 84 year old woman with a hx of TIAs, CAD, HTN,
   iron-deficiency anemia who presents with symptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   1. BRADYCARDIA:
   Pt was found to be in a junctional rhythm on arrival to ED.  Possible
   etiologies include medication effects of both b-blocker and CCB.  She
   has a creatinine of 1.0 which is up from baseline of 0.6 which could be
   contributing to prolonged effect of Atenolol. This Acute renal failure
   is [**Last Name (un) 10476**] pre-renal and related to dehydration and blood loss. Other
   etiologies include sinus node dysfuction/sick sinus syndrome or
   myocardial ischemia.  ECG does not show ST segment changes and cardiac
   enzymes are negative x 2.  She is confused per her son and taking
   medications inappropriately is a possibility.
   - continue supportive care while nodal agents wash out
   - hold atenolol and verapamil
   - if pt continues to have symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension, would
   give atropine 1mg x 1 and start dopamine gtt
   - if continues, will consult EP for ?pacer
   - cycle cardiac enzymes; ECG in AM
   .
   2. HYPOTENSION:
   Likely effect of bradycardia.  Pt is also dry on exam.  Also may be due
   to volume loss from GI bleed.
   - continue IV fluids
   - transfuse for HCT < 24 or active bleed
   - trend HCT overnight
   .
   3. GI BLEED: Her source is likely a slow UGIB given hx of
   gastritis/gastric ulcers and recent prednisone intake. Patient may also
   have a colonic source as she is at risk for diverticulitis, colon ca.
   Guaiac positive on exam.  HCT fell from 32.3 to 25.4 in 15 hours.
   Patient transitioned to PPI drip
   - continue protonix drip. The concern here is the theoretical ppi and
   plavix interaction that, when observed in studies, is least with
   pantoprazole.
   - trend HCT; transfuse for HCT < 24 or acute bleed
   - active T&S
   - NPO for now
   - GI following but defers EGD for now
   .
   4. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:
   Unclear history.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has q waves on ECG but no prior caths or
   stents.  On Plavix for TIAs.  Not on aspirin.
   - holding B-blocker
   .
   5. HX of TIAs:
   - continue Plavix for now; will consider holding if HCT drops
   .
   6. RASH: patient with long history of pruritic rash, not evident on
   exam
   - unclear indication for prednisone.  will hold in the setting of
   possible GI bleed
   - hold on cipro and cephalexin
   .
   7. FEN: NPO given possible GI bleed until HCT stable
   .
   8. PPX: Hold SC Heparin given GI bleed; continue IV PPI; hold bowel
   regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of TIAs, CAD, HTN, and iron-deficiency anemia. She presented with symptomatic bradycardia and possible etiologies include medication effects, sinus node dysfunction, or myocardial ischemia. The patient's creatinine level is elevated from 0.6 to 1.0, indicating acute renal failure that may be pre-renal due to dehydration and blood loss. She also has a history of gastritis/gastric ulcers and recent prednisone intake, which may contribute to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has guaiac positive on exam and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 32.3 to 25.4 in 15 hours. She is at risk for diverticulitis and colon cancer. The patient's coronary artery disease history is unclear, with q waves on ECG but no prior catheters or stents. She is on Plavix for TIAs but not on aspirin. The patient has a long history of pruritic rash but it is not evident on exam. She is currently NPO given possible GI bleed until HCT stable. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 10471] is an 84-year-old woman with a history of TIAs, CAD, HTN, and iron-deficiency anemia who presents with symptomatic bradycardia. She has been found to have a junctional rhythm, which could be due to medication effects of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. Her creatinine level has increased from 0.6 to 1.0, indicating acute renal failure that is pre-renal and related to dehydration and blood loss. Other potential etiologies of bradycardia include sinus node dysfunction/sick sinus syndrome or myocardial ischemia. She is also confused and may be taking medications inappropriately.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia could worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential hypotension.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could further worsen, resulting in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. GI Bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding could continue or worsen, leading to significant blood loss and potential shock.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could progress, resulting in a decrease in urine output and accumulation of waste products in the body.
5. Medication Interactions: The patient's medications may interact with each other, potentially causing adverse effects or reducing their efficacy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10471**] is an 84 year old woman with a hx of TIAs, CAD, HTN,
   iron-deficiency anemia who presents with symptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   1. BRADYCARDIA:
   Pt was found to be in a junctional rhythm on arrival to ED.  Possible
   etiologies include medication effects of both b-blocker and CCB.  She
   has a creatinine of 1.0 which is up from baseline of 0.6 which could be
   contributing to prolonged effect of Atenolol. This Acute renal failure
   is [**Last Name (un) 10476**] pre-renal and related to dehydration and blood loss. Other
   etiologies include sinus node dysfuction/sick sinus syndrome or
   myocardial ischemia.  ECG does not show ST segment changes and cardiac
   enzymes are negative x 2.  She is confused per her son and taking
   medications inappropriately is a possibility.
   - continue supportive care while nodal agents wash out
   - hold atenolol and verapamil
   - if pt continues to have symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension, would
   give atropine 1mg x 1 and start dopamine gtt
   - if continues, will consult EP for ?pacer
   - cycle cardiac enzymes; ECG in AM
   .
   2. HYPOTENSION:
   Likely effect of bradycardia.  Pt is also dry on exam.  Also may be due
   to volume loss from GI bleed.
   -  transfuse for HCT < 24 or active bleed
   - trend HCT overnight
   .
   3. GI BLEED: Her source is likely a slow UGIB given hx of
   gastritis/gastric ulcers and recent prednisone intake. Patient may also
   have a colonic source as she is at risk for diverticulitis, colon ca.
   Guaiac positive on exam.  HCT fell from 32.3 to 25.4 in 15 hours.
   Patient transitioned to PPI drip
   - continue protonix drip. The concern here is the theoretical ppi and
   plavix interaction that, when observed in studies, is least with
   pantoprazole.
   - trend HCT; transfuse for HCT < 24 or acute bleed
   - active T&S
   - NPO for now
   - GI following but defers EGD for now
   .
   4. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:
   Unclear history.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has q waves on ECG but no prior caths or
   stents.  On Plavix for TIAs.  Not on aspirin.
   - holding B-blocker
   .
   5. HX of TIAs:
   - continue Plavix for now; will consider holding if HCT drops
   .
   6. RASH: patient with long history of pruritic rash, not evident on
   exam
   - unclear indication for prednisone.  will hold in the setting of
   possible GI bleed. Treat hypotension, though unlikely with steroids.
   - hold on cipro and cephalexin
   .
   7. FEN: NPO given possible GI bleed until HCT stable

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of TIAs, CAD, HTN, and iron-deficiency anemia who presents with symptomatic bradycardia. She has been found to be in a junctional rhythm, which could be due to medication effects or other etiologies such as sinus node dysfunction or myocardial ischemia. The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.6 to 1.0, indicating acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal due to dehydration and blood loss. Other possible causes of her symptoms include volume loss from GI bleed, medication effects, and sick sinus syndrome. The patient's HCT has fallen from 32.3 to 25.4 in 15 hours, suggesting ongoing blood loss. She is also at risk for diverticulitis and colon cancer. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and she does not have ST segment changes on ECG. She is confused and may be taking medications inappropriately. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's symptomatic bradycardia needs to be closely monitored and managed. If it continues, atropine may be given, and dopamine infusion may be considered. A pacemaker may be consulted if necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to bradycardia and volume loss from GI bleed. She may require transfusion for HCT < 24 or active bleed. Close monitoring of HCT is important.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of gastritis/gastric ulcers and is at risk for diverticulitis and colon cancer. Her HCT has significantly fallen, indicating ongoing blood loss. She is on a PPI drip, and her bowel regimen has been held. Continued monitoring and management of her GI bleed is necessary.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of CAD is unclear, with q waves on ECG but no prior caths or stents. She is on Plavix for TIAs but not on aspirin. Her B-blocker has been held.
5. HX of TIAs: The patient has a history of TIAs, for which she is on Plavix. This medication may need to be considered in the context of her current condition.
6. RASH: The patient has a long history of a pruritic rash that is not evident on examination. The indication for prednisone is unclear, and it may need to be held due to the possible GI bleed.
7. FEN: The patient is NPO given possible GI bleed until HCT is stable.
8. PPX: Hold SC Heparin given GI bleed; continue IV PPI; hold bowel regimen.
9. CODE: The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.
10. Disposition: The patient will be admitted to the CCU for overnight monitoring."

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of gastritis/gastric ulcers and recent prednisone intake, which increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The presence of guaiac-positive stools indicates a positive test for blood in the stool. The patient was transfused with two units of blood due to a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. There is also a concern for a colonic source of bleeding, such as diverticulitis or colon cancer.

2. Bradycardia: The patient presented with symptomatic bradycardia, possibly related to medication effects (beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker). The patient's heart rate was found to be low (61-83 bpm), and she experienced confusion and inappropriately took medications, which may have contributed to the bradycardia.

3. Hypertension: The patient has been hyperensive between 122-160+ systolic, likely due to the discontinuation of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker. The patient's blood pressure is elevated despite being off these medications.

4. Hypotension: The patient also experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be related to volume loss from the GI bleed, the effect of bradycardia, or dehydration.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10471**] is an 84 year old woman with a hx of TIAs, CAD, HTN,
   iron-deficiency anemia who presents with symptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   #. GI BLEED: Her source is likely a slow UGIB given hx of
   gastritis/gastric ulcers and recent prednisone intake. Patient may also
   have a colonic source as she is at risk for diverticulitis, colon ca.
   Guaiac positive on exam.  Was transfused with two units as HCT fell
   from 32.3 to 25.4 in 15 hours on the day of admission. Patient briefly
   transitioned to PPI drip and then on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue protonix. The concern here is the theoretical ppi and plavix
   interaction that, when observed in studies, is least with pantoprazole.
   GI plan to scope today but patient did not complete colon prep
   - trend HCT; transfuse for HCT < 24 or acute bleed
   - active T&S
   - NPO for now
   - GI following: will see if still can EGD as that is where there is
   highest likelihood of bleed
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Delirium with Dementia: Patient came from home
   where she lives independently. However there are questions about how
   well she can care for herself, including severe sundowning and likely
   medication confusion. SW consulted.
   - PT and OT evals to assess ADL
s/ self
   - Pt would benefit from VNA referral, if not rehab or adult day care to
   better support her medical compliance and increase social outlets; pt
   declined.
   - sw following
   .
   #. BRADYCARDIA:
   Pt was found to be in a junctional rhythm on arrival to ED.  Possible
   etiologies include medication effects of both b-blocker and CCB.  She
   has a creatinine of 1.0 which is up from baseline of 0.6 which could be
   contributing to prolonged effect of Atenolol. This Acute renal failure
   is [**Last Name (un) 10476**] pre-renal and related to dehydration and blood loss. Other
   etiologies include sinus node dysfuction/sick sinus syndrome or
   myocardial ischemia.  ECG does not show ST segment changes and cardiac
   enzymes are negative x 2.  She is confused per her son and daughter and
   taking medications inappropriately is a possibility.
   - resolved
   - hold atenolol and verapamil
   - if pt continues to have symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension, would
   give atropine 1mg x 1 and start dopamine gtt
   .
   # Hypertension: Off of atenolol and verapamil, patient has been
   hyperensive between 122-160+ systolic. Likely essential and related to
   held medications.
   - add [**Last Name (un) **], valasartan 80 qd
   .
   #. HYPOTENSION:
   likely effect of bradycardia.  Pt is also dry on exam.  Also may be due
   to volume loss from GI bleed.
   - resolved
   .
   #. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:
   Unclear history.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has q waves on ECG but no prior caths or
   stents.  On Plavix for TIAs.  Not on aspirin.
   - holding B-blocker
   .
   #. HX of TIAs:
   - continue Plavix for now; GI aware of plan
   .
   #. RASH: patient with long history of pruritic rash, not evident on
   exam
   - unclear indication for prednisone.  will hold in the setting of
   possible GI bleed. If withdrawakm treat hypotension, though unlikely,
   with steroids (in addition to fluids).
   - hold on cipro and cephalexin
   .
   #. FEN: NPO if procedure, clears otherwise
   .
   #. PPX: Hold SC Heparin given GI bleed; continue IV PPI; hold bowel

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of TIAs, CAD, HTN, and iron-deficiency anemia. She presents with symptomatic bradycardia and has been diagnosed with GI bleed, altered mental status with delirium and dementia, hypertension, hypotension, coronary artery disease, HX of TIAs, rash, and potential medication interactions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:
1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of gastritis/gastric ulcers and recent prednisone intake, which increases the risk of GI bleeding. If not managed properly, it can lead to further blood loss and potential shock.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's delirium and dementia pose a risk for falls, self-neglect, and medication confusion. Inadequate management may worsen her cognitive impairment and increase the risk of complications such as aspiration pneumonia.
3. Hypertension: If left uncontrolled, the patient's hypertension can lead to target organ damage, including cardiovascular events, renal impairment, and retinopathy.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia can be a result of medication effects or underlying sinus node dysfunction. If severe or symptomatic, it may compromise cardiac output and lead to hypotension and inadequate perfusion.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of TIAs, CAD, HTN, and iron-deficiency anemia. She presents with symptomatic bradycardia and has been diagnosed with a GI bleed, likely from a slow upper gastrointestinal bleed or a colonic source. She has been transfused with two units of blood due to a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. The patient is currently on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip for acid suppression. She also has altered mental status with delirium and dementia, and there are concerns about her ability to care for herself. She is also at risk for diverticulitis and colon cancer. The patient's hypertension may be related to held medications, and her hypotension may be due to volume loss from the GI bleed. She has a history of coronary artery disease, but it is unclear if she has any previous cardiac interventions. She is currently not on aspirin, but taking Plavix for TIAs. The patient has a long history of pruritic rash and was prescribed prednisone, which is being held due to the possible GI bleed. She is NPO for an upcoming procedure and will clear otherwise. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is to the floor until she undergoes a scope.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of TIAs, CAD, HTN, and iron-deficiency anemia. She presented with symptomatic bradycardia and was found to have a junctional rhythm on arrival to the ED. Possible etiologies include medication effects of b-blocker and CCB. She also has acute renal failure pre-renal related to dehydration and blood loss. 

The patient's current conditions include GI bleed, altered mental status with delirium and dementia, bradycardia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of TIAs, and microcytic anemia. She is currently on multiple medications including Plavix, pantoprazole (Protonix), atenolol, verapamil, losartan, and iron supplementation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4 C (97.5%)
- Heart Rate: 72 bpm (sinus rhythm)
- Blood Pressure: 171/55 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 97%

Lab results show:
- White Blood Cell Count: 6.7 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 28.1%
- Platelet Count: 214 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
- Troponin: <0.01 ng/mL
- Glucose: 79 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient is at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding due to her history of gastritis/gastric ulcers and recent prednisone intake. She may also have a colonic source as she is at risk for diverticulitis and colon cancer.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing delirium with dementia, which can be exacerbated by medication interactions or changes in medication regimen.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia has resolved, but there is a possibility of recurrence, especially if medications like atenolol and verapamil are restarted.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely essential and related to held medications. It should be carefully managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of CAD may contribute to further cardiac complications if not properly managed.
6. History of TIAs: The patient is on Plavix for TIAs, and there is a risk of further cerebrovascular events if not adequately managed.
7. Anemia: The patient's microcytic anemia requires ongoing management and monitoring.
8. RASH: The patient has a history of a pruritic rash, but it is not evident on examination. This may require further evaluation and management.

She has been transfused with two units of blood as her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) fell from 32.3 to 25.4 in 15 hours on the day of admission. The patient has been transitioned to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and then started on IV PPI. She is scheduled for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy today.

The patient also has altered mental status, possibly due to delirium with dementia. She lives independently but has severe sundowning and likely medication confusion. Social work has been consulted, but she refuses rehabilitation or daily care center.

The patient's bradycardia has resolved, but there is a concern for medication effects of both beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker. Acute renal failure is pre-renal and related to dehydration and blood loss. Other etiologies include sinus node dysfunction/sick sinus syndrome or myocardial ischemia. ECG does not show ST segment changes and cardiac enzymes are negative x 2. The patient's hypertension is likely essential and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of TIAs, CAD, HTN, and iron-deficiency anemia. She presents with symptomatic bradycardia, GI bleed, altered mental status, hypertension, coronary artery disease, HX of TIAs, anemia, and rash. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient is likely experiencing a slow upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) due to gastritis/gastric ulcers and recent prednisone intake. She also has a risk for diverticulitis and colon cancer, which could contribute to a potential colonic source for bleeding. The patient has been transfused with blood products and is receiving IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to manage the bleeding.

2. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient is showing signs of confusion, dementia, severe sundowning, and likely medication confusion. She refuses rehabilitation or daily care center and declined a VNA referral. Social work is following up with her to assess her ability to care for herself independently.

3. Bradycardia: The patient initially presented with bradycardia, which has since resolved. Possible etiologies include medication effects of both beta-blocker (atenolol) and calcium channel blocker (verapamil). Acute renal failure, dehydration, and blood loss may be contributing factors"
