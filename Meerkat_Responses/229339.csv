   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom with TBI, CVA, s/p trach who was transferred from [**Hospital1 880**] with
   VAP, UTI, bacteremia, ARF.
   #  Sepsis:  Pt. has/had baceteremia, PNA, and UTI.  Pt. transferred on
   zosyn and aztreonam.  He had completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.
   Per OSH records now on Day 9 of Zosyn and Day 6 of aztreonam.
   Antibiotic regimen unclear, however seems like short duration of
   antibiotics to treat bacteremia.  CXR concerning for infiltrate v.
   fluid overload
   - continue vancomycin
   - ID consult to determine further antibiotics and duration
   - blood cultures
   - CXR
   - UA/Ucx
   - sputum culture
   # Respiratory Failure:  In terms of chronicity on ventilator, appears
   to be trached and vent dependent. Pt s/p 2 trach changes now with
   decreased leak around trach.  Pt. on CMV with FiO2 of 60%.  Respiratory
   failure likely due to PNA and sepsis.  ARF and fluid retention may also
   be contributing to this.  Fluid status in the setting of albumin <1 is
   difficult to treat.  Would not necessarily benefit from fluid resusc.
   [**Month (only) 51**] require dialysis
   - OSH records
   - Repeat CXR
   #  Acute Renal Failure:  Cr is 3.3 with baseline in low 2s.  Renal US
   at OSH showed small renal stone, no hydronephrosis.  Evaluated by renal
   at [**Hospital1 880**] and not thought to be a dialysis candidate.  As a result
   he was transferred here at request of his daughter.
   - urine lytes
   - UA/U Cx
   - follow up on renal consult
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Appears to be in new A. Fib with HR of
   80s-90s.  Had been on metoprolol at rehab facility, however BP here
   will not tolerate beta blocker.  Possible triggers for A. Fib include
   CHF,
   - Could consider 5 mg (MRx 1) diltiazem if rapid A. Fib with fluid
   bolus
   - If SBP< 90, dig load v. amio
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate had been normal at OSH.
   Possible etiologies include uremia and possible starvtion ketosis.
   - repeat lactate in am
   # Decubitus Ulcers:  Pt. has multiple decubiti which have been treated
   with aquacel.  Per OSH note, concern for R foot osteo, seen by podiatry
   and just kept on aquacel with bedside debridement. Was not considered
   an operative candidate.
   - wound care consult
   #  Gastroparesis/Vomiting:  Pt. was on TF at [**Hospital1 **], but experienced
   gastroparesis and abdominal distention at OSH. Per daughter, he did
   better when he was on Zofran as opposed to reglan in the past.  As a
   result he was started on TPN at OSH
   - J tube to gravity, check residuals
   - Nutrition consult for TPN recs
   - consider switch back to TF
   # Anemia:  Likely anemia of chronic disease.  No obvious source of
   bleeding, but pt. is coagulopathic with DIC picture.  Coffee grounds
   aspirated from NGT. Appropriate increase to 1unit blood.
   - Repeat Hct in am
   - Check DIC and hemolysis labs
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**] IV
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy:  Low platelets, elevated PT/PTT/INR.
   Possible DIC picture
   - as above follow up DIC labs
   - smear
   # Transaminitis:  According to OSH record, pt. had US on [**3-5**] showing
   GB wall thickening, sludge, and thickened distal CBD, however no
   further treatment was pursued due to lack of symptoms of cholangitis.
   - LFTs here are within normal limits - trend LFTs
   - consider repeat US if elevated
   # DM:
   - continue ISS, add glargine if uncontrolled
   #ectopy. Appears to have 11 beat run of VT on tele
   - if continues consider switch to neo
   - check PM lytes
   # Goals of Care:  Per OSH records, multiple attempts at family meetings
   to discuss goals of care have been made.  It has been felt by other
   providers and facilities that the patient has been suffering a great
   deal.  Renal team at [**Hospital1 880**] did not feel he was a dialysis
   candidate.  According to [**Hospital3 140**] records, they had attempted to
   include other family members in goals of care discussion, however his
   daughter would not allow this.  Thus, he has remained full code.
   - Palliative care/Ethics consult after discussion with daughter

   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and tracheostomy. The patient was transferred from another hospital with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's current condition includes sepsis, respiratory failure, ARF, atrial fibrillation, anion gap metabolic acidosis, decubitus ulcers, gastroparesis/vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, transaminitis, diabetes mellitus, and ectopic beats.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of VAP, UTI, and bacteremia. There is a concern for ongoing infection as indicated by the need for further antibiotic therapy and cultures.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to be ventilator-dependent with decreased respiratory function. There is a concern for possible chronic respiratory failure.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment. There is a need for ongoing monitoring and management of renal function.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a new onset of atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. Management of this condition is necessary to prevent complications such as stroke or hemodynamic instability.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of TBI, CVA, s/p trach, who was transferred from another hospital with VAP, UTI, bacteremia, and ARF. He has been on zosyn and aztreonam for 9 days, but his antibiotic regimen is unclear. The patient has several medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, anion gap metabolic acidosis, decubitus ulcers, gastroparesis/vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, transaminitis, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia, pneumonia, and UTI, which can lead to sepsis. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is ventilator-dependent and has a tracheostomy. There is concern for pneumonia due to fluid overload on chest X-ray. Further evaluation and management of respiratory status are needed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline. Renal function should be closely monitored, and the cause of acute renal failure should be investigated.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in new-onset atrial fibrillation. Cardioversion may be considered if rapid and hemodynamically unstable. Rate control"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom with TBI, CVA, s/p trach who was transferred from [**Hospital1 880**] with
   VAP, UTI, bacteremia, ARF.
   #  Sepsis:  Pt. has/had baceteremia, PNA, and UTI.  Pt. transferred on
   zosyn and aztreonam.  He had completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.
   Per OSH records now on Day 9 of Zosyn and Day 6 of aztreonam.
   Antibiotic regimen unclear, however seems like short duration of
   antibiotics to treat bacteremia.  CXR concerning for infiltrate v.
   fluid overload
   - continue vancomycin
   - ID consult to determine further antibiotics and duration
   - blood cultures
   - CXR
   - UA/Ucx
   - sputum culture
   # Respiratory Failure:  Pt s/p 2 trach changes now with decreased leak
   around trach.  Pt. on CMV with FiO2 of 60%.  Respiratory failure likely
   due to PNA and sepsis.  ARF and fluid retention may also be
   contributing to this.  Fluid status in the setting of albumin <1 is
   difficult to treat.  Would not necessarily benefit from fluid resusc.
   [**Month (only) 51**] require dialysis
   - Wean vent as tolerated, consider pressure support trial
   - Touch base with renal
   - Repeat CXR
   #  Acute Renal Failure:  Cr is 3.2 with baseline in low 2s.  Renal US
   at OSH showed small renal stone, no hydronephrosis.  Evaluated by renal
   at [**Hospital1 880**] and not thought to be a dialysis candidate.  As a result
   he was transferred here at request of his daughter.
   - urine lytes
   - UA/U Cx
   - renal consult tomorrow
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Appears to be in new A. Fib with HR of
   80s-90s.  Had been on metoprolol at rehab facility, however BP here
   will not tolerate beta blocker.  Possible triggers for A. Fib include
   CHF,
   - Could consider 5 mg (MRx 1) diltiazem if rapid A. Fib with fluid
   bolus
   - If SBP< 90, dig load v. amio
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate had been normal at OSH.
   Possible etiologies include uremia and possible starvtion ketosis.
   - repeat lactate in am
   # Decubitus Ulcers:  Pt. has multiple decubiti which have been treated
   with aquacel.  Per OSH note, concern for R foot osteo, seen by podiatry
   and just kept on aquacel with bedside debridement. Was not considered
   an operative candidate.
   - wound care consult
   #  Gastroparesis/Vomiting:  Pt. was on TF at [**Hospital1 **], but experienced
   gastroparesis and abdominal distention at OSH. Per daughter, he did
   better when he was on Zofran as opposed to reglan in the past.  As a
   result he was started on TPN at OSH
   - J tube to gravity, check residuals
   - Nutrition consult for TPN recs
   - consider switch back to TF
   # Anemia:  Likely anemia of chronic disease.  No obvious source of
   bleeding, but pt. is coagulopathic with DIC picture.  Coffee grounds
   aspirated from NGT
   - Hrepeat Hct in am
   - Check DIC and hemolysis labs
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**] IV
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy:  Low platelets, elevated PT/PTT/INR.
   Possible DIC picture
   - as above follow up DIC labs
   - smear
   # Transaminitis:  According to OSH record, pt. had US on [**3-5**] showing
   GB wall thickening, sludge, and thickened distal CBD, however no
   further treatment was pursued due to lack of symptoms of cholangitis.
   - LFTs here are within normal limits - trend LFTs
   - consider repeat US if elevated
   # DM:
   - continue ISS, add glargine if uncontrolled
   # Goals of Care:  Per OSH records, multiple attempts at family meetings
   to discuss goals of care have been made.  It has been felt by other
   providers and facilities that the patient has been suffering a great
   deal.  Renal team at [**Hospital1 880**] did not feel he was a dialysis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and tracheostomy who was transferred from another hospital with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, anion gap metabolic acidosis, decubitus ulcers, gastroparesis/vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, transaminitis, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia, pneumonia, and UTI, indicating a systemic infection that can lead to sepsis. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for signs of septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and weaning off the ventilator as tolerated is essential.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in new-onset atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 80s-90s. Managing this arrhythmia is crucial to maintain adequate cardiac output and prevent thromboembolic events.
4. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap, indicating a"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom with TBI, CVA, s/p trach who was transferred from [**Hospital1 880**] with
   VAP, UTI, bacteremia, ARF.
   #  Sepsis:  Pt. has/had baceteremia, PNA, and UTI.  Pt. transferred on
   zosyn and aztreonam.  He had completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.
   Per OSH records now on Day 9 of Zosyn and Day 6 of aztreonam.
   Antibiotic regimen unclear, however seems like short duration of
   antibiotics to treat bacteremia.  CXR concerning for infiltrate v.
   fluid overload
   - continue vancomycin
   - ID consult to determine further antibiotics and duration
   - blood cultures
   - CXR
   - UA/Ucx
   - sputum culture
   # Respiratory Failure:  Pt s/p 2 trach changes now with decreased leak
   around trach.  Pt. on CMV with FiO2 of 60%.  Respiratory failure likely
   due to PNA and sepsis.  ARF and fluid retention may also be
   contributing to this.  Fluid status in the setting of albumin <1 is
   difficult to treat.  Would not necessarily benefit from fluid resusc.
   [**Month (only) 51**] require dialysis
   - Wean vent as tolerated, consider pressure support trial
   - Touch base with renal
   - Repeat CXR
   #  Acute Renal Failure:  Cr is 3.3 with baseline in low 2s.  Renal US
   at OSH showed small renal stone, no hydronephrosis.  Evaluated by renal
   at [**Hospital1 880**] and not thought to be a dialysis candidate.  As a result
   he was transferred here at request of his daughter.
   - urine lytes
   - UA/U Cx
   - follow up on renal consult
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Appears to be in new A. Fib with HR of
   80s-90s.  Had been on metoprolol at rehab facility, however BP here
   will not tolerate beta blocker.  Possible triggers for A. Fib include
   CHF,
   - Could consider 5 mg (MRx 1) diltiazem if rapid A. Fib with fluid
   bolus
   - If SBP< 90, dig load v. amio
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate had been normal at OSH.
   Possible etiologies include uremia and possible starvtion ketosis.
   - repeat lactate in am
   # Decubitus Ulcers:  Pt. has multiple decubiti which have been treated
   with aquacel.  Per OSH note, concern for R foot osteo, seen by podiatry
   and just kept on aquacel with bedside debridement. Was not considered
   an operative candidate.
   - wound care consult
   #  Gastroparesis/Vomiting:  Pt. was on TF at [**Hospital1 **], but experienced
   gastroparesis and abdominal distention at OSH. Per daughter, he did
   better when he was on Zofran as opposed to reglan in the past.  As a
   result he was started on TPN at OSH
   - J tube to gravity, check residuals
   - Nutrition consult for TPN recs
   - consider switch back to TF
   # Anemia:  Likely anemia of chronic disease.  No obvious source of
   bleeding, but pt. is coagulopathic with DIC picture.  Coffee grounds
   aspirated from NGT
   - Hrepeat Hct in am
   - Check DIC and hemolysis labs
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**] IV
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy:  Low platelets, elevated PT/PTT/INR.
   Possible DIC picture
   - as above follow up DIC labs
   - smear
   # Transaminitis:  According to OSH record, pt. had US on [**3-5**] showing
   GB wall thickening, sludge, and thickened distal CBD, however no
   further treatment was pursued due to lack of symptoms of cholangitis.
   - LFTs here are within normal limits - trend LFTs
   - consider repeat US if elevated
   # DM:
   - continue ISS, add glargine if uncontrolled
   # Goals of Care:  Per OSH records, multiple attempts at family meetings
   to discuss goals of care have been made.  It has been felt by other
   providers and facilities that the patient has been suffering a great
   deal.  Renal team at [**Hospital1 880**] did not feel he was a dialysis
   candidate.  According to [**Hospital3 140**] records, they had attempted to
   include other family members in goals of care discussion, however his
   daughter would not allow this.  Thus, he has remained full code.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of TBI, CVA, and tracheostomy, who was admitted with VAP, UTI, bacteremia, and ARF. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been treated with various antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and daptomycin. He also has a history of sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, anion gap metabolic acidosis, decubitus ulcers, gastroparesis/vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, transaminitis, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of VAP, UTI, bacteremia, and sepsis. There is a potential risk of further infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of indwelling lines.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on CMV with FiO2 of 60%. There is a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure due to PNA, sepsis, ARF, and fluid overload.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level in the low 2s, indicating pre-existing renal impairment. There is a potential risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in new-onset atrial fibrillation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and tracheostomy who was transferred from another hospital with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently dependent on the ventilator. He has an atrial fibrillation rhythm and requires monitoring of his heart rate and blood pressure. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, transaminitis, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia, VAP, and UTI, indicating possible ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is ventilator-dependent and has a chronic respiratory condition, making him at risk for further respiratory complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has a small renal stone without hydronephrosis. There is no indication for dialysis according to the renal service.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. It needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to uremia or starvation ketosis.
6. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has multiple decubitus ulcers that need regular wound care management.
7. Gastroparesis/Vomiting: The patient experienced gastroparesis at the previous hospital, and there are plans to switch back to enteral feeding once the condition improves.
8. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has low platelets and elevated clotting times, indicating a possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) picture.
9. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, and there is a possibility of cholestasis or biliary sludge.
10. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes, which requires ongoing management.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current conditions put him at risk for various complications requiring close monitoring and appropriate interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom with TBI, CVA, s/p trach who was transferred from [**Hospital1 880**] with
   VAP, UTI, bacteremia, ARF.
   #  Sepsis:  Pt. has/had baceteremia, PNA, and UTI.  Pt. transferred on
   zosyn and aztreonam.  He had completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.
   Per OSH records now on Day 9 of Zosyn and Day 6 of aztreonam.
   Antibiotic regimen unclear, however seems like short duration of
   antibiotics to treat bacteremia.  CXR concerning for infiltrate v.
   fluid overload.
   - continue vancomycin 1gm IV x 1, then dose 1gm IV for vancomycin level
   less than 15.
   - Check daily vancomycin level
   - Appreciate ID recommendations.
   - d/c daptomycin and start ciprofloxacin 200mg IV q 24 hours.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - CXR
   - f/u UA/Ucx
   - f/u sputum culture
   # Respiratory Failure:  In terms of chronicity on ventilator, appears
   to be trached and vent dependent. Pt s/p 2 trach changes now with
   decreased leak around trach.  Pt. on CMV with FiO2 of 60%.  Respiratory
   failure likely due to PNA and sepsis.  ARF and fluid retention may also
   be contributing to this.  Fluid status in the setting of albumin <1 is
   difficult to treat.  Would not necessarily benefit from fluid resusc.
   [**Month (only) 51**] require dialysis.
   - OSH records
   - Repeat CXR
   #  Acute Renal Failure:  Cr is 3.5 today with baseline in low 2s.
   Renal US at OSH showed small renal stone, no hydronephrosis.  Evaluated
   by renal at [**Hospital1 880**] and not thought to be a dialysis candidate.  As a
   result he was transferred here at request of his daughter. Renal
   service recommends no renal replacement therapy under any
   circumstances. UOP has trailed off to nothing today.
   - urine lytes
   - f/u UA/U Cx
   - Will define plan of care with patient/family
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Appears to be in new A. Fib with HR of
   80s-90s.  Had been on metoprolol at rehab facility, however BP here
   will not tolerate beta blocker.  Possible triggers for A. Fib include
   CHF.  Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Could consider 5 mg (MRx 1) diltiazem if rapid A. Fib with fluid
   bolus
   - If SBP< 90, dig load v. amio
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate had been normal at OSH.
   Possible etiologies include uremia and possible starvtion ketosis.
   - repeat lactate in am
   # Decubitus Ulcers:  Pt. has multiple decubiti which have been treated
   with aquacel.  Per OSH note, concern for R foot osteo, seen by podiatry
   and just kept on aquacel with bedside debridement. Was not considered
   an operative candidate.
   - Continue with wound care consult recommendations
   #  Gastroparesis/Vomiting:  Pt. was on TF at [**Hospital1 **], but experienced
   gastroparesis and abdominal distention at OSH. Per daughter, he did
   better when he was on Zofran as opposed to reglan in the past.  As a
   result he was started on TPN at OSH
   - J tube to gravity, check residuals
   - Nutrition consult for TPN recs
   - consider switch back to TF
   # Anemia:  Likely anemia of chronic disease.  No obvious source of
   bleeding, but pt. is coagulopathic with DIC picture.  Coffee grounds
   aspirated from NGT. Appropriate increase to 1unit blood.
   - Repeat Hct in am
   - Check DIC and hemolysis labs
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**] IV
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy:  Low platelets, elevated PT/PTT/INR.
   Possible DIC picture
   - as above follow up DIC labs
   - smear
   # Transaminitis:  According to OSH record, pt. had US on [**3-5**] showing
   GB wall thickening, sludge, and thickened distal CBD, however no
   further treatment was pursued due to lack of symptoms of cholangitis.
   - LFTs here are within normal limits - trend LFTs
   - consider repeat US if elevated
   # DM:
   - continue ISS, add glargine if uncontrolled
   #ectopy. Appears to have 11 beat run of VT on tele
   - Patient now on neosynephrine.
   # Goals of Care:  Per OSH records, multiple attempts at family meetings
   to discuss goals of care have been made.  It has been felt by other
   providers and facilities that the patient has been suffering a great
   deal.  Renal team at [**Hospital1 880**] did not feel he was a dialysis
   candidate.  According to [**Hospital3 140**] records, they had attempted to
   include other family members in goals of care discussion, however his
   daughter would not allow this.  Thus, he has remained full code.
   - Palliative care/Ethics consult after discussion with daughter

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of TBI, CVA, and tracheostomy who was transferred from another hospital with VAP, UTI, bacteremia, and ARF. The patient is currently on day 9 of Zosyn and day 6 of aztreonam. The antibiotic regimen seems to be short for treating bacteremia. The patient's chest X-ray is concerning for an infiltrate versus fluid overload. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, anion gap metabolic acidosis, decubitus ulcers, gastroparesis/vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, transaminitis, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is ventilator-dependent and has a tracheostomy in place. There is a concern for pneumonia and fluid overload, which may contribute to respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and a small renal stone on ultrasound. Renal replacement therapy is not recommended by the renal service.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Beta-blockers are not tolerated due to hypotension.
4. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a normal lactate level but may"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom with TBI, CVA, s/p trach who was transferred from [**Hospital1 880**] with
   VAP, UTI, bacteremia, ARF.
   #  Sepsis:  Pt. has/had baceteremia, PNA, and UTI.  Pt. transferred on
   zosyn and aztreonam.  He had completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.
   Per OSH records now on Day 9 of Zosyn and Day 6 of aztreonam.
   Antibiotic regimen unclear, however seems like short duration of
   antibiotics to treat bacteremia.  CXR concerning for infiltrate v.
   fluid overload.
   - continue vancomycin 1gm IV x 1, then dose 1gm IV for vancomycin level
   less than 15.
   - f/u daily vancomycin level
   - Appreciate ID recommendations.
   - continue on vancomycin, ciproflox, cefepime, and flagyl.
   - f/u blood cultures (NGTD)
   - CXR
   - f/u UA/Ucx (prelim coag + staph aureus)
   - f/u sputum culture (prelim pseudomonas)
   # Respiratory Failure:  In terms of chronicity on ventilator, appears
   to be trached and vent dependent. Pt s/p 2 trach changes now with
   decreased leak around trach.  Pt. on CMV with FiO2 of 60%.  Respiratory
   failure likely due to PNA and sepsis.  ARF and fluid retention may also
   be contributing to this.  Fluid status in the setting of albumin <1 is
   difficult to treat.  Would not necessarily benefit from fluid resusc.
   [**Month (only) 51**] require dialysis.
   - OSH records
   - Repeat CXR
   #  Acute Renal Failure:  Cr is 3.7 today with baseline in low 2s.
   Renal US at OSH showed small renal stone, no hydronephrosis.  Evaluated
   by renal at [**Hospital1 880**] and not thought to be a dialysis candidate.  As a
   result he was transferred here at request of his daughter. Renal
   service recommends no renal replacement therapy under any
   circumstances. UOP has trailed off to nothing today.
   - follow UOP (now anuric), CVP 4-5 will fluid bolus 500cc NS
   - f/u UCx
   - Will define plan of care with patient/family
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Appears to be in new A. Fib with HR of
   80s-90s.  Had been on metoprolol at rehab facility, however BP here
   will not tolerate beta blocker.  Possible triggers for A. Fib include
   CHF.  Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Could consider 5 mg (MRx 1) diltiazem if rapid A. Fib with fluid
   bolus
   - If SBP< 90, dig load v. amio
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate had been normal at OSH.
   Possible etiologies include uremia and possible starvation ketosis.
   - repeat lactate in am
   # Decubitus Ulcers:  Pt. has multiple decubiti which have been treated
   with aquacel.  Per OSH note, concern for R foot osteo, seen by podiatry
   and just kept on aquacel with bedside debridement. Was not considered
   an operative candidate.
   - Continue with wound care consult recommendations
   #  Gastroparesis/Vomiting:  Pt. was on TF at [**Hospital1 **], but experienced
   gastroparesis and abdominal distention at OSH. Per daughter, he did
   better when he was on Zofran as opposed to reglan in the past.  As a
   result he was started on TPN at OSH
   - J tube to gravity, check residuals
 discuss with GI again for PEG
   placement
   - consider switch back to TF
   # Anemia:  Likely anemia of chronic disease.  No obvious source of
   bleeding, but pt. is coagulopathic with DIC picture.  Coffee grounds
   aspirated from NGT. HCT downtrending with HCT 24 this morning.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon; Transfuse for HCT < 22
   - Check DIC and hemolysis labs
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**] IV
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy:  Low platelets, elevated PT/PTT/INR.
   Possible DIC picture
   - as above follow up DIC labs
   # Transaminitis:  According to OSH record, pt. had US on [**3-5**] showing
   GB wall thickening, sludge, and thickened distal CBD, however no
   further treatment was pursued due to lack of symptoms of cholangitis.
   - LFTs here are within normal limits and have been since admission.  No
   need to continue to trend.
   # DM:
   - continue ISS, add glargine if uncontrolled
   #ectopy. Appears to have 11 beat run of VT on tele
   - Patient now on neosynephrine.
   # Goals of Care:  Continued discussion with daughter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and tracheostomy, who was admitted to the ICU with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, anion gap metabolic acidosis, decubitus ulcers, gastroparesis, anemia, thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, transaminitis, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia, pneumonia, and UTI, which can lead to systemic infection and sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy. Chronic respiratory failure may occur due to underlying lung issues and fluid overload.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output, indicating renal dysfunction.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in new-onset atrial fibrillation, which may lead to complications such as stroke or hemodynamic instability.
5. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap, indicating metabolic acidosis. This could be due to various causes like lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis"

   Antibiotic regimen unclear, however seems like short duration of
   antibiotics to treat bacteremia.  CXR concerning for infiltrate v.
   fluid overload.
   - continue vancomycin 1gm IV x 1, then dose 1gm IV for vancomycin level
   less than 15.
   - f/u daily vancomycin level
   - Appreciate ID recommendations.
   - continue on vancomycin, ciproflox, cefepime, and flagyl.
   - f/u blood cultures (NGTD)
   - CXR daily
   - f/u UA/Ucx (prelim coag + staph aureus)
   - f/u sputum culture (prelim pseudomonas)
   #  Acute Renal Failure:  Cr is 3.7 today with baseline in low 2s.
   Renal US at OSH showed small renal stone, no hydronephrosis.  Evaluated
   by renal at [**Hospital1 880**] and not thought to be a dialysis candidate.  As a
   result he was transferred here at request of his daughter. Renal
   service recommends no renal replacement therapy under any
   circumstances, which has been communicated to family. UOP has trailed
   off to nothing today.
   - follow UOP (now anuric), CVP 4-5 will fluid bolus 500cc NS
   - f/u UCx
   - Will define plan of care with patient/family
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Appears to be in new A. Fib with HR of
   80s-90s.  Had been on metoprolol at rehab facility, however BP here
   will not tolerate beta blocker.  Possible triggers for A. Fib include
   CHF.  Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Could consider 5 mg (MRx 1) diltiazem if rapid A. Fib with fluid
   bolus
   - If SBP< 90, dig load v. amio
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate had been normal at OSH.
   Possible etiologies include uremia and possible starvation ketosis.
   - 2 amps of bicarb
   # Decubitus Ulcers:  Pt. has multiple decubiti which have been treated
   with aquacel.  Per OSH note, concern for R foot osteo, seen by podiatry
   and just kept on aquacel with bedside debridement. Was not considered
   an operative candidate.
   - Continue with wound care consult recommendations
   # Gastroparesis/Vomiting:  Pt. was on TF at [**Hospital1 **], but experienced
   gastroparesis and abdominal distention at OSH. Per daughter, he did
   better when he was on Zofran as opposed to reglan in the past.  As a
   result he was started on TPN at OSH
   - J tube to gravity, check residuals
   - consider switch back to TF
   # Anemia:  Likely anemia of chronic disease.  No obvious source of
   bleeding, but pt. is coagulopathic with DIC picture.  Coffee grounds
   aspirated from NGT. HCT downtrending with HCT 24 this morning.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon; Transfuse for HCT < 22
   - Check DIC and hemolysis labs
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**] IV
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy:  Low platelets, elevated PT/PTT/INR.
   Possible DIC picture
   - as above follow up DIC labs
   # Transaminitis:  According to OSH record, pt. had US on [**3-5**] showing
   GB wall thickening, sludge, and thickened distal CBD, however no
   further treatment was pursued due to lack of symptoms of cholangitis.
   - LFTs here are within normal limits and have been since admission.  No
   need to continue to trend.
   # DM:
   - continue ISS, add glargine if uncontrolled
   #ectopy. Appears to have 11 beat run of VT on tele
   - Patient now on neosynephrine.
   # Goals of Care:  Continued discussion with daughter.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and tracheostomy who was transferred from another hospital with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is dependent on the ventilator.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to be chronically ventilator-dependent and has decreased lung compliance. There is also a concern for fluid overload, which may contribute to respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia, PNA, and UTI, and is currently on multiple antibiotics. The concern is that the patient may develop sepsis due to ongoing infection.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. There is no hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound, but the patient is anuric (producing no urine). The renal service recommends against renal replacement therapy.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. The cause could be related to congestive heart failure or other factors.

5. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yom with TBI, CVA, s/p trach who was transferred from [**Hospital1 880**] with
   VAP, UTI, bacteremia, ARF.
   # Respiratory Failure:  In terms of chronicity on ventilator, appears
   to be trached and vent dependent. Pt s/p 2 trach changes now with
   decreased leak around trach.  Pt. on CMV with FiO2 of 60%.  Respiratory
   failure likely due to PNA and sepsis.  ARF and fluid retention may also
   be contributing to this.  Fluid status in the setting of albumin <1 is
   difficult to treat.  Would not necessarily benefit from fluid
   resuscitation.
   - OSH records
   - Repeat CXR
   #  Sepsis:  Pt. has/had bacteremia, PNA, and UTI.  Pt. transferred on
   zosyn and aztreonam.  He had completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.
   Per OSH records now on Day 9 of Zosyn and Day 6 of aztreonam.
   Antibiotic regimen unclear, however seems like short duration of
   antibiotics to treat bacteremia.  CXR concerning for infiltrate v.
   fluid overload.
   - continue vancomycin 1gm IV x 1, then dose 1gm IV for vancomycin level
   less than 15.
   - f/u daily vancomycin level
   - Appreciate ID recommendations.
   - continue on vancomycin, ciproflox, cefepime, and flagyl.
   - f/u blood cultures (NGTD)
   - CXR daily
   - f/u UA/Ucx (prelim coag + staph aureus)
   - f/u sputum culture (prelim pseudomonas)
   #  Acute Renal Failure:  Cr is 3.7 today with baseline in low 2s.
   Renal US at OSH showed small renal stone, no hydronephrosis.  Evaluated
   by renal at [**Hospital1 880**] and not thought to be a dialysis candidate.  As a
   result he was transferred here at request of his daughter. Renal
   service recommends no renal replacement therapy under any
   circumstances, which has been communicated to family. UOP has trailed
   off to nothing today.
   - follow UOP (now anuric), CVP 4-5 will fluid bolus 500cc NS
   - f/u UCx
   - Will define plan of care with patient/family
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Appears to be in new A. Fib with HR of
   80s-90s.  Had been on metoprolol at rehab facility, however BP here
   will not tolerate beta blocker.  Possible triggers for A. Fib include
   CHF.  Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Could consider 5 mg (MRx 1) diltiazem if rapid A. Fib with fluid
   bolus
   - If SBP< 90, dig load v. amio
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Lactate had been normal at OSH.
   Possible etiologies include uremia and possible starvation ketosis.
   - 2 amps of bicarb
   # Decubitus Ulcers:  Pt. has multiple decubiti which have been treated
   with aquacel.  Per OSH note, concern for R foot osteo, seen by podiatry
   and just kept on aquacel with bedside debridement. Was not considered
   an operative candidate.
   - Continue with wound care consult recommendations
   # Gastroparesis/Vomiting:  Pt. was on TF at [**Hospital1 **], but experienced
   gastroparesis and abdominal distention at OSH. Per daughter, he did
   better when he was on Zofran as opposed to reglan in the past.  As a
   result he was started on TPN at OSH
   - J tube to gravity, check residuals
   - consider switch back to TF
   # Anemia:  Likely anemia of chronic disease.  No obvious source of
   bleeding, but pt. is coagulopathic with DIC picture.  Coffee grounds
   aspirated from NGT. HCT downtrending with HCT 24 this morning.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon; Transfuse for HCT < 22
   - Check DIC and hemolysis labs
   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**] IV
   # Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy:  Low platelets, elevated PT/PTT/INR.
   Possible DIC picture
   - as above follow up DIC labs
   # Transaminitis:  According to OSH record, pt. had US on [**3-5**] showing
   GB wall thickening, sludge, and thickened distal CBD, however no
   further treatment was pursued due to lack of symptoms of cholangitis.
   - LFTs here are within normal limits and have been since admission.  No
   need to continue to trend.
   # DM:
   - continue ISS, add glargine if uncontrolled
   #ectopy. Appears to have 11 beat run of VT on tele
   - Patient now on neosynephrine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of TBI, CVA, and tracheostomy who was transferred from Hospital1 with VAP, UTI, bacteremia, and ARF. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and has decreased SBPs in the 70s. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and elevated Cr. He has multiple decubitus ulcers and a small renal stone without hydronephrosis. The patient is anuric and has an elevated CVP of 5-6 mmHg. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to be tracheally and ventilator-dependent. He has decreased leak around trach, but respiratory failure is likely due to PNA and sepsis. ARF and fluid retention may also contribute to this. Fluid status is difficult to treat with albumin <1.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and tracheostomy, who was transferred from Hospital1 with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently dependent on the ventilator and has a tracheostomy in place. The respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia and sepsis, as well as fluid retention. The patient's fluid status is difficult to treat due to low albumin levels. Antibiotic therapy includes Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Metronidazole. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient has multiple decubitus ulcers and a possible right foot osteomyelitis. The patient has been treated for gastroparesis and abdominal distention with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy, with a possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) picture. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits. The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, and he is experiencing episodes of ectopic beats.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient was noted to be in asystole, which is a state of no cardiac activity. This indicates a severe cardiac complication leading to the cessation of heart function.

2. Respiratory failure: The absence of spontaneous respirations suggests respiratory failure or impairment.

3. Brain death: The lack of corneal reflex and absence of palpable pulses indicate significant neurological damage or brain death.
