   #. Hypotension: Appearance is most consistent with a septic picture
   with fever, markedly elevated WBC, warm extremities and shock. Most
   likely source is ascending cholangitis due to obstructed pancreatic
   stent. It is unclear if new liver lesions are aggressive mets vs.
   abscess. However, given previous bacteremia and ? new liver lesions,
   must consider endocarditis with septic emboli Will institute early goal
   directed therapy.
   -Aggressive IVF with goal CVP 8-10
   -Pressors as needed, with change to levophed and add vasopressin if
   needed
   -Trend Lactate
   -Check mixed venous 02 sat and HCT, if <70 transfuse to HCT>30 and if
   still low, consider starting dopamine.
   -Antibiotics with vanc/zosyn, which should cover her previous
   enterococcus, however, given less effective MIC for zosyn, will add on
   synergistic gentamicin
   -Will hold on surgery or IR for ? abscess vs. mets in liver. If they
   are abscesses they may drain with clearance of the obstruction.
   However, if persistent septic, will consider more aggressive treatment
   but must discuss with family.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver. She presents with fever, jaundice, and pain for the last two days. The patient appears to have hypotension, warm extremities, and shock, which is most consistent with a septic picture. The most likely source of infection is ascending cholangitis due to an obstructed pancreatic stent. It is unclear if the new liver lesions are aggressive metastases or abscesses. However, given the previous bacteremia and the possibility of new liver lesions, endocarditis with septic emboli needs to be considered.

The plan is to institute early goal-directed therapy, including aggressive intravenous fluids with a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-10, use of pressors as needed, and consideration of levophed and vasopressin if necessary. Lactate levels will be trended, mixed venous O2 saturation and hematocrit will be monitored, and if the hematocrit is below 70, transfusion to a hematocrit of 30 will be considered. If the patient remains hypotensive, dopamine may be started. Antibiotics will be administered, including vancomycin and zosyn, which should cover previous enterococcus infection. However, given the less effective MIC for zosyn, gentamicin will be added on for synergistic effect. Surgery or interventional radiology ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female who was admitted with cholangitis following stenting. She developed septic shock, but her condition has been improving with decreasing reliance on vasopressors. Her urine output has stabilized at around 50 cc/hour, and lactate levels are trending downward. She continues to receive aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-10. Pressor therapy is being weaned off, with the goal of maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Antibiotics have been adjusted to cover previous enterococcal infection. Surgical or interventional radiology options for abscess drainage or addressing liver lesions are being considered. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and she should be able to wean off the ventilator once hemodynamically stable. Sedation management and pain control strategies are being implemented. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status remains full code, and her current disposition is to remain in the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Persistent septic shock: The patient's improvement trend suggests a positive response to current treatment, but there is still a risk of ongoing or recurrent septic shock if the infection does not fully resolve.
2. Organ dysfunction: Despite improvement, the"

   Pancreatic CA, now with cholangitis and sepsis, s/p ERCP.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent following ERCP.  Radiographic
   evidence for evolving RLL infiltrate (probable aspirtaion).  Monitor on
   mechanical ventilation.  Monitor CXR.  Hope to work towards SBT as wean
   vasopressors, wean sedation, and if CXR does not evolve.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence for
   cardiac event, pulmonary embolism, GI bleed.   Improved on current
   regimen.
   CHOLANGITIS -- obstruction, s/p prior plastic stent --> now removed and
   replaced with larger caliber metal stent last PM, with good drainage.
   Monitor VS, LFTs.  Monitor amylase/lipase.
   SEPSIS -- likely cholangitis.  High likelihood for recurrent
   Enterococcal infection (recent bacteremia).  Continue to support.
   MULTIPLE LIVER LESIONS -- new abscesses vs. metastatic malignancy.
   Monitor LFTs, will require re-imaging to assess interval change
   following treatment of infection.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- resolved.  Monitor, maintain >4.0
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Now replete to CVP >12 cmH2O
   RENAL FUNCTION  -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of hypotension. They have been intubated and mechanically ventilated following an ERCP procedure. Central access has been established, and the patient has received IV fluid boluses. Vasopressors have been increased, and the patient is currently on Levophed and vasopressin.

The patient's history is obtained from medical records as they are unable to provide a history due to sedation. Allergies include morphine, confusion, and delirium. The patient has been administered various antibiotics, including gentamicin, piperacillin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/59 mmHg to 80/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, central venous pressure is 16 mmHg, and mixed venous O2% saturation is 98-98.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of edema or jaundice. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and respiratory examination"

- A larger caliber metal stent has been placed to relieve obstruction in the bile duct.
- The patient has multiple liver lesions, which may be new abscesses or metastatic malignancy.
- The patient's renal function is preserved, and electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, have been resolved.
- Lactic acidosis is improving, and the patient's white blood cell count is significantly elevated due to infection.
- The patient is sedated, but plans are in place to taper sedation.
- Nutritional support will be initiated if the patient remains intubated.
- Immediate plans for chemotherapy have been put on hold while the patient is septic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure persists following the ERCP procedure, and there is radiographic evidence of evolving right lower lobe infiltrate, likely due to aspiration. Close monitoring of the patient's mechanical ventilation and chest X-ray is necessary. The goal is to wean vasopressors, sedation, and avoid further deterioration of lung function.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female who presented with cholangitis after stenting and subsequently developed septic shock. She has been in the ICU and has shown improvement, with a decrease in the need for vasoactive medications and normalization of lactate levels.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and widespread organ dysfunction due to an infection. Although she is improving, there is still a risk of complications such as organ failure or persistent hypotension.

2. Enterococcus Infection: The patient was previously on gentamicin, but it was stopped and she is now receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). This change in antibiotics suggests that there may have been a concern for an enterococcus infection, which can be resistant to certain antibiotics.

3. Liver Lesions: The patient has liver lesions, which are suspected to be metastases from pancreatic cancer or abscesses spreading through the biliary tree. Further evaluation and management are required for these lesions.

4. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient has a history of GERD, for which she is being continued on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and ranitidine.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient"

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.1°C (98.7°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate (HR) of 82 bpm with a normal range of 69-94 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 103/55 mmHg to 129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute with a normal range of 17-24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%, and sinus rhythm (SR) as the heart rhythm.

The patient is receiving various medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, omeprazole, ranitidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The flow sheet data indicates that the patient's fluid balance is positive with a total input of 2,426 mL and a total output of 1,465 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance of 45.5 cmH2O/mL, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, PaO2 of 287 mmHg, and HCO3- of 22 mEq/L.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 44.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.3 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 227 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 103 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.7 mg/dL, glucose of 122 mg/dL, and lactate of 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of septic shock, aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) administration with a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-10, weaning of pressors while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg, trending lactate levels, and continuation of antibiotics with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The plan also includes consideration of surgery or interventional radiology (IR) for abs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with cholangitis who underwent stenting and subsequently developed septic shock. She is currently in the ICU and has shown slight improvement with decreasing need for vasopressor support. Her lactate levels have normalized, and she has been weaned off vasopressin. The patient is receiving aggressive IV fluids with the goal of maintaining a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-10 mmHg. Antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) are being administered to cover her previous enterococcus infection, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's respiratory status is stable, allowing for potential weaning off the ventilator soon. Sedation will be lightened this morning prior to extubation. Liver lesions suggestive of presumptive pancreatic cancer metastasis or biliary tree abscesses are noted. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with lansoprazole, and pain management with a fentanyl drip. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has cholangitis and septic shock, indicating a severe infection. There is a risk of ongoing or recurrent infections, especially with the presence of indwelling lines and tubes.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (ALT/AST"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female who was admitted with cholangitis after stenting and subsequently developed septic shock. The patient's current condition is improving with decreasing need for vasopressors and normal lactate levels. The plan includes aggressive intravenous fluid administration to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-10, weaning of pressors, continuation of antibiotics, follow-up blood cultures, and evaluation of the patient's respiratory status for possible extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has cholangitis and septic shock, indicating an ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bloodstream infections, or catheter-related infections.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are elevated, suggesting possible liver dysfunction. Additionally, there are liver lesions that could be due to metastatic pancreatic cancer or abscesses spreading through the biliary tree.

3. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent DVT.

4. Bleeding: The patient has a high international normalized ratio (INR) and low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Care should be taken during procedures or interventions to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pancreatic CA, now with cholangitis and sepsis, s/p ERCP.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent following ERCP.  Radiographic
   evidence for evolving RLL infiltrate (probable aspirtaion).  Monitor on
   mechanical ventilation.  Monitor CXR.  Hope to work towards SBT as wean
   vasopressors, wean sedation, and if CXR does not evolve.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence for
   cardiac event, pulmonary embolism, GI bleed.   Improved on current
   regimen, continue to wean vasopressor.
   CHOLANGITIS -- obstruction, s/p prior plastic stent --> now removed and
   replaced with larger caliber metal stent last PM, with good drainage.
   Monitor VS, LFTs.  Monitor amylase/lipase.
   SEPSIS -- likely cholangitis.  High likelihood for recurrent
   Enterococcal infection (recent bacteremia).  Continue to support.
   MULTIPLE LIVER LESIONS -- new abscesses vs. metastatic malignancy.
   Monitor LFTs, will require re-imaging to assess interval change
   following treatment of infection.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- resolved.  Monitor, maintain >4.0
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia --> repleted to CVP >12 cmH2O.  Monitor I/O.
   RENAL FUNCTION  -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- improved.  Monitor.
   WBC elevation -- marked increase.  Attributed to infection.  Monitor.
   NEUROLOGICAL -- sedated currently.  HOpe to be able to taper sedation.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- start TF if remains intubated --> hold.
   PANCREATIC CA -- no immediate plans for chemotherapy while septic.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure following an ERCP procedure. There is evidence of evolving right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, which may indicate aspiration. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and the healthcare team is monitoring the situation closely.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. The current regimen seems to be improving the condition, and the vasopressor is being weaned off gradually.

3. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis due to an obstruction that was previously treated with a plastic stent. Now, a larger caliber metal stent has been placed, and the healthcare team is monitoring vital signs and liver function tests.

4. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis secondary to cholangitis. There is a high likelihood of recurrent Enterococcal infection, and supportive care is being provided.

5. Multiple liver lesions: The patient has new abscesses or metastatic malignancy in the liver. Further imaging will be required to assess the interval change following treatment of infection.

6. Hypokalemia: The patient had hypokalemia, but it has resolved. Monitoring is ongoing to maintain potassium levels above 4.0.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pancreatic CA, now with cholangitis and sepsis, s/p ERCP.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent following ERCP.  Radiographic
   evidence for evolving RLL infiltrate (probable aspirtaion).  Monitor on
   mechanical ventilation.  Monitor CXR.  Hope to work towards SBT as wean
   vasopressors, wean sedation, and if CXR does not evolve.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence for
   cardiac event, pulmonary embolism, GI bleed.   Improved on current
   regimen, continue to wean vasopressor.
   CHOLANGITIS -- obstruction, s/p prior plastic stent --> now removed and
   replaced with larger caliber metal stent last PM, with good drainage.
   Monitor VS, LFTs.  Monitor amylase/lipase.
   SEPSIS -- likely cholangitis.  High likelihood for recurrent
   Enterococcal infection (recent bacteremia).  Continue to support.
   MULTIPLE LIVER LESIONS -- new abscesses vs. metastatic malignancy.
   Monitor LFTs, will require re-imaging to assess interval change
   following treatment of infection.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- resolved.  Monitor, maintain >4.0
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia --> repleted to CVP >12 cmH2O.  Monitor I/O.
   RENAL FUNCTION  -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- improved.  Monitor.
   WBC elevation -- marked increase.  Attributed to infection.  Monitor.
   NEUROLOGICAL -- sedated currently.  HOpe to be able to taper sedation.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- start TF if remains intubated --> hold.
   PANCREATIC CA -- no immediate plans for chemotherapy while septic.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is critically ill with a history of pancreatic cancer, cholangitis, and sepsis. They are currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a low blood pressure which has improved with the current regimen and is being weaned off vasopressors. Cholangitis is attributed to obstruction caused by a plastic stent, which has been replaced with a larger caliber metal stent. Sepsis is likely due to cholangitis and a recent bacteremia. Multiple liver lesions are present, which could be new abscesses or metastatic malignancy. The patient's potassium levels have normalized, but they need to maintain a level above 4.0. Fluid repletion has been done to address hypovolemia, and renal function is being monitored. Lactic acidosis has improved, and white blood cell count is markedly elevated due to infection. The patient is currently sedated and hopes to taper sedation soon. Nutritional support will be provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as the patient is unable to tolerate enteral feeding. Pancreatic cancer treatment plans will be discussed after the patient's recovery from sepsis. The patient is in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of cholangitis post stenting, who presented with septic shock. She has been weaned off of pressors and her blood cultures remain negative. The patient is currently on antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, with a therapeutic trough level. The antibiotic regimen will be continued for a 14-day course. 

The patient was previously extubated yesterday and is breathing comfortably. There are no signs of airway edema. The lethargy may be due to a long washout of sedation or depression, so a social worker and psychiatrist consultation has been requested.

There are liver lesions present, which are presumed to be pancreatic cancer metastases, but could also be biliary tree abscesses. Antibiotic treatment will continue and the primary oncologist will be consulted.

The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for which a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and ranitidine will be continued.

The patient is to be advanced to clear liquids as tolerated. 

She has peripheral IV (PIV) and radial internal jugular (RIJ) lines, with an arterial line also in place. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin, holding bowel regular while NPO, and pain management with a fentanyl drip.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with cholangitis following stenting. She has a history of septic shock and is currently showing signs of improvement with decreasing need for vasopressors. Her lactate levels have normalized, and she has been weaned off vasopressin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (83-101 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 129/75 mmHg (98/45-129/75 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (19-36 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg (1-7 mmHg), with total input of 2,489 mL and total output of 3,225 mL. Her fluid balance is -736 mL (-1,029 mL). 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with a ventilator mode set to standby. Her tidal volume (Vt) is 350 mL (350-440 mL), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 6 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 0 cmH2"

   Pancreatic CA, now with cholangitis and sepsis, s/p ERCP.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- improved s/p extubation.  MOnitor RR, SaO2.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CHOLANGITIS -- obstruction, s/p prior plastic stent --> now removed and
   replaced with larger caliber metal stent last PM, with good drainage.
   Monitor VS, LFTs.  Monitor amylase/lipase.
   SEPSIS -- resolving.
   MULTIPLE LIVER LESIONS -- new abscesses vs. metastatic malignancy.
   Monitor LFTs, will require re-imaging to assess interval change
   following treatment of infection.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- resolved.  Monitor, maintain >4.0
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia --> repleted to CVP >12 cmH2O.  Monitor I/O.
   RENAL FUNCTION  -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- improved.  Monitor.
   WBC elevation -- Attributed to infection, now resolving.  Monitor.
   NEUROLOGICAL -- sedated currently.  Hope to be able to taper sedation.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- start clear liquids, monitor;  encourage
   suppliments.  COnsider TF if PO inadequate.
   PANCREATIC CA -- no immediate plans for chemotherapy while septic.

The patient has been extubated and is off vasopressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 142/79 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 55.9 K/uL, an elevated C-reactive protein level of 33.8 mg/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 224 K/uL. Liver function tests reveal elevated liver enzymes, and there is evidence of renal dysfunction with an elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 94 mg/dL and a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Electrolyte imbalances include hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 142 mEq/L.

The patient's current medical plan includes monitoring respiratory status, blood pressure, and liver function tests. The patient's nutritional support is being initiated with clear liquids and encouragement of supplements, considering the possibility of total parenteral nutrition if oral intake is inadequate. The patient's pancreatic cancer management will be discussed further with an oncology consultation, although immediate"

   Pancreatic CA, now with cholangitis and sepsis, s/p ERCP.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- improved s/p extubation.  MOnitor RR, SaO2.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   CHOLANGITIS -- obstruction, s/p prior plastic stent --> now removed and
   replaced with larger caliber metal stent last PM, with good drainage.
   Monitor VS, LFTs.  Monitor amylase/lipase.
   SEPSIS -- resolving.
   MULTIPLE LIVER LESIONS -- new abscesses vs. metastatic malignancy.
   Monitor LFTs, will require re-imaging to assess interval change
   following treatment of infection.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- resolved.  Monitor, maintain >4.0
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia --> repleted to CVP >12 cmH2O.  Monitor I/O.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with cholangitis post stenting who presented with septic shock. She has been treated with antibiotics and is currently on a 14-day course of Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 127/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is alert and oriented to person, hospital, and month. Physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, marked jaundice, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, clear lungs, mildly tender abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and trace pitting edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low total CO2, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, amylase, lipase, albumin, lactate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits or slightly elevated.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for a 14-day course, following up with blood cultures, extubation with monitoring for airway edema, consulting social work and physical therapy for coping strategies and sedation washout, discussing liver lesions with the primary oncologist, advancing to clear liquids as tolerated, replacing the central venous catheter due to refusal of the PICC"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of cholangitis post stenting who presented with septic shock. She has been receiving antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin, which have been adjusted to achieve therapeutic trough levels for a 14-day course. The patient has been weaned off pressors and no longer exhibits septic physiology. Her blood cultures remain negative. She was extubated yesterday and is breathing comfortably, with follow-up for signs of airway edema. The patient's lethargy is likely due to long-term sedation washout or depression, and she is being evaluated by a social worker and physical therapist. Imaging suggests presumptive pancreatic cancer metastases or biliary tree abscesses, so continued antibiotic treatment and discussion with the primary oncologist are recommended. She also has GERD, for which she will continue PPI and ranitidine. The patient is on clear liquids and will advance as tolerated. She has multiple lines in place, including PIV, RIJ, and A-line. She is on a fentanyl drip for pain management. Code status is full code, and she will be considered for discharge from the ICU tomorrow if her condition remains stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of cholangitis and septic shock indicates a risk for ongoing infections. Monitoring blood cultures and adjusting antibiotic therapy will be crucial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic pancreatic cancer admitted to the ICU with cholangitis. She initially presented with septic shock and respiratory failure but has shown improvement, including decreasing leukocytosis, resolving acidosis, and being extubated and taken off pressors. Her current vital signs are stable, and she is alert and oriented. She has mild epigastric tenderness but no other significant abnormalities on physical examination. Her laboratory results show some abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes. She is receiving antibiotics and will continue the treatment for 14 days. The plan is to advance her diet as tolerated and consider a percutaneous intrahepatic biliary (PIHB) procedure for cholangitis. 

Potential Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is still receiving antibiotics, indicating ongoing concern for infection. There is a risk of developing further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient has been extubated and is off pressors, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and potential complications.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis requires intervention, and there is a risk of complications related to the PIHB procedure, such as bleeding or bile leak.
4. Pancreatic Cancer: The patient's metastatic pancreatic cancer may progress and lead to further complications such as pain, weight"
