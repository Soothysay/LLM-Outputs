   24 yr old with SLE ESRD and recurrent admits for HTN urgency presents
   with dyspnea. Of note she has been in ICU twice in past 10 days for HTN
   urgency.
   She was feeling poorly
 tired, SOB, headache - and missed HD today and
   instead came to ED. On arrival she had BP of 260/130. They found
   asymmetric BP in both arms and sent for CTA to rule out disection. CTA
   shows no dissection but persistent SVC thrombus (old) and new bilat
   ground glass parenchymal infiltrates.
   She was given IV labetalol and labetalol drip - hope had been urgent HD
   but pressures to high to get HD. Tx to MICU for further management
   24 Hour Events:
   - fever to 102.7 --> blood, urine, sputum cx sent

 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   1.       HTN urgency: we will keep her on labetalol gtt, started home
   meds (clonidine, nifedipine, hydralazine, aliskiren), and watch MAPs-
   goal is to get her 160-180 range. Currently she does not have acute ECG
   changes but is in pulm edema and needs urgent HD to help with volume
   and lower BPS
   2.       Fever: pt with fever to 102.7
 blood, urine, sputum cx
   drawn.  Empiric vanc and levofloxacin.
   3.       Cough and Dyspnea: very SOB right now and needs HD and may
   need NIPPV for her pulm edema in the interval. Notably dyspnea has been
   a feature of her recent presentations and she also has new effusion
   4.       Worsening ascites and Pericardial Eff: serositis related to
   SLE perhaps, pericardial could be uremic, but does appears to have
   worsened maybe due to chronic vol overload
 underdialyzed due to non
   compliance. Might benefit from para to work up when hemodynamics stable
   5.       Anemia: she required blood on last admit but is already back
   down to 22 today.  Unsure of source of blood loss. Certainly epo issues
   but will look for gi losses and even marrow suppression
   6.       SVC syndrome: chronic; requires anti coagulation but may not
   bridge with heparin given HTN

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presents with dyspnea and high blood pressure. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for hypertension urgency. On this admission, she missed her scheduled hemodialysis (HD) session and instead went to the emergency department with a blood pressure of 260/130. The physical examination revealed asymmetric blood pressure in both arms and new bilateral ground glass parenchymal infiltrates on computed tomography angiography (CTA). She was given intravenous labetalol and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.

24-hour events include fever, elevated blood pressure, and initiation of antibiotics. Allergies are documented, including penicillins, Percocet (rash), and morphine (itching). The patient's medical history includes SLE and ESRD, and she is currently on multiple medications for blood pressure control.

Physical examination findings include tachypnea, increased work of breathing, enucleated left eye, bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, tender abdomen, muscle wasting, warm skin, and attentive but focused mental status. Vital signs show fever, elevated blood pressure, and increased heart rate.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal chronic superior vena cava"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever to 102.7, elevated blood pressure, and recent changes in medication. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, rash from Percocet and itching from morphine. The patient is currently on vancomycin and levofloxacin. The patient has been diagnosed with acute pain, unknown origin fever, end-stage renal disease, and malignant hypertension. The patient is in the ICU for pain control, fever management, renal failure, and hypertensive crisis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels. The patient may require dialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's elevated blood pressure poses a risk of hypertensive emergency. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with antihypertensive medications is necessary to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac events.
4. Pain Management: The patient's acute and chronic pain should be carefully assessed and managed to ensure comfort and prevent further complications.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant negative balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Monitoring fluid intake and output, adjusting"

   1.       SOB
 likely related to HTN urgency/emergency leading to pulm
   edema vs. possible superimposed infection (as seen by fevers and new
   ground glass bilateral pulm infiltrates).  Of note, her oxygen
   requirement has decreased, arguing for the former.  With regard to her
   HTN urgency, she is off the labetalol gtt, started home meds
   (clonidine, nifedipine, hydralazine, aliskiren), and watch MAPs- goal
   is to get her near SBP 160. HD will help with volume overload.
   2.       Fever: pt with fever to 102.7
 blood, urine, sputum cx
   drawn.  Suspect this is not a bacterial infection, but will cont vanc
   and levofloxacin for one day, and ensure cx are neg.
   3.       Cough and Dyspnea: SOB slightly improved with HD.  Notably
   dyspnea has been less of a feature of her recent presentations as
   compared to HA; she also has new effusion.
   4.       Worsening ascites and Pericardial Effusion: serositis related
   to SLE is a possibility, though she has not had an active flare in some
   time.  Will follow complement levels.  Pericardial fluid could be
   uremic, but does appears to have worsened maybe due to chronic vol
   overload, as she is likely underdialyzed due to non compliance. Might
   benefit from para or [**Female First Name (un) **], but at this time, will wait and see if
   these fluid collections resolve with HD.
   5.       Anemia/thrombocytopenia: ddx includes lupus flare (unlikely)
   vs medication induced vs. infection (viral or bacterial).  Of note, she
   required blood on last admit but is already back down to 22 today.
   Unsure of source of blood loss. Perhaps she is missing her epo doses,
   as she has missed HD frequently in the past.  Will look for GI losses
   and even marrow suppression.
   6.       SVC syndrome: chronic; requires anti coagulation but will not
   bridge with heparin given HTN and ICH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 24-year-old with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for hypertension urgency.
- She presented with dyspnea and missed her scheduled hemodialysis (HD) session, instead going to the emergency department.
- Upon arrival, she had an extremely high blood pressure of 260/130 mmHg and asymmetric blood pressure in both arms. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was performed to rule out aortic dissection, which was negative.
- The CTA showed an old superior vena cava thrombus and new bilateral ground glass parenchymal infiltrates on the chest X-ray.
- She was given intravenous labetalol and started on vancomycin and levofloxacin due to fever and the presence of ground glass infiltrates.
- Her blood pressure remained elevated, making it difficult to proceed with HD. She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for further management.
- During her stay, she experienced a fever of 102.7°F and her blood pressure continued to be high at times.
- She has a history of allergies to penicillins, Percocet, and morphine.
- Her vital signs showed a maximum temperature of 102.7°F, current temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of"

","Summary:
The patient is a female with multiple medical conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. She presented with shortness of breath, fever, and worsening ascites and pericardial effusion. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and oxygen saturation at 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, fever, cough, and dyspnea. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and new ground glass bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggest the possibility of a superimposed infection.
2. Volume overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance and is likely underdialyzed due to non-compliance, which may lead to worsening fluid overload and complications such as pulmonary edema.
3. Serositis: The worsening ascites and pericardial effusion raise the possibility of serositis related to SLE.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's low hemoglobin and platelet count may be due to lupus flare, medication-induced, infection, or other causes like missing epo doses or GI losses.

 likely related to HTN urgency/emergency leading to pulm
   edema vs. possible superimposed infection (as seen by fevers and new
   ground glass bilateral pulm infiltrates).  Of note, her oxygen
   requirement has decreased, arguing for the former.  With regard to her
   HTN urgency, she is off the labetalol gtt, started home meds
   (clonidine, nifedipine, hydralazine, aliskiren), and watch MAPs- goal
   is to get her near SBP 160. HD will help with volume overload.

   3.       Cough and Dyspnea: SOB slightly improved with HD.  Notably
   dyspnea has been less of a feature of her recent presentations as
   compared to HA; she also has new effusion.
   4.       Worsening ascites and Pericardial Effusion: serositis related
   to SLE is a possibility, though she has not had an active flare in some
   time.  Will follow complement levels.  Pericardial fluid could be
   uremic, but does appears to have worsened maybe due to chronic vol
   overload, as she is likely underdialyzed due to non compliance. Might
   benefit from para or [**Female First Name (un) **], but at this time, will wait and see if
   these fluid collections resolve with HD.
   5.       Anemia/thrombocytopenia: ddx includes lupus flare (unlikely)
   vs medication induced vs. infection (viral or bacterial).  Of note, she
   required blood on last admit but is already back down to 22 today.
   Unsure of source of blood loss. Perhaps she is missing her epo doses,
   as she has missed HD frequently in the past.  Will look for GI losses
   and even marrow suppression.

   bridge with heparin given HTN and ICH.

She presents with dyspnea and hypertensive urgency, but her oxygen requirement has decreased. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/103 to 174/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. She is on multiple medications including clonidine, nifedipine, hydralazine, aliskiren, labetalol, and others.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 67 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL, platelet count of 90 mg/dL, creatinine level of 5.2 mg/dL, glucose level of 90 mg/dL, and elevated potassium levels. Her electrolyte imbalances include low sodium (24 mEq/L) and potassium (4.1 mEq/L) levels. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient presented with dyspnea and hypertensive urgency, but is currently stable with improved blood pressure control. Fever has been present, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been drawn. The patient also has new effusion and worsening ascites and pericardial effusion, which could be related to SLE serositis or chronic volume overload. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are also present, possibly due to medication-induced, infection, or a lupus flare. The patient has a history of SVC thrombosis and requires anticoagulation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's dyspnea and history of hypertensive emergency with pulmonary edema suggest the possibility of recurrent pulmonary edema.
2. Infection: Despite being afebrile overnight, the patient has a fever, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been drawn. This indicates a concern for infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), previous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and recent small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient presents with dyspnea and hypertensive urgency. 

24-hour events include an allergic reaction to Percocet, itching with morphine, and the last dose of antibiotics (vancomycin) was administered at 02:17 AM. The patient has been receiving various ICU medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and sedatives.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate between 102-109 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/55 to 174/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 822 mL and output of 2400 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1578 mL. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 93%, but no mechanical ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient presents with dyspnea and hypertensive urgency. The patient's blood culture is positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/103 mmHg to 174/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse tenderness in the abdomen, especially in the lower quadrants, and some rales noted on respiratory examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency with pulmonary edema vs. infection: The patient's high blood pressure and symptoms of dyspnea raise concerns for hypertensive emergency with pulmonary edema. The positive blood culture suggests the possibility of an infectious cause as well.

2. Chronic cough: The patient's chronic cough may indicate an underlying respiratory condition, such as chronic bronchitis or lung infection. Further evaluation with a chest CT and follow-up CX"

The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient presents with dyspnea, hypertensive urgency, chronic cough, ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions, chronic abdominal pain, anemia/pancytopenia, ESRD on HD, h/o gastric ulcer, SLE, h/o SVC thrombosis, seizure disorder, and depression. The patient is currently experiencing increased blood pressure and pain in the abdomen, despite receiving labetalol and dilaudid IV. The patient remains hypertensive and tachycardic, with ongoing pain. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate, along with a fever. Physical examination reveals tachycardia, crackles on the left lung, distended abdomen with tenderness, particularly in the lower left quadrant (LLQ), and no extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, potassium, and sodium, with elevated creatinine, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen levels. Imaging studies show bilateral lung infiltrates and nodularity."

   Assessment and Plan
   24F with h/o SLE, ESRD on HD, malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, PRES,
   prior ICH, and recent SBO, p/w dyspnea, and hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertension / Tachycardia
 on further review of the patient
   chart, it was discovered that her oral beta blocker needed to be
   restarted since she was stopped on the labetalol drop
   - pt restarted on labetalol 1gm TID
   - pt also given labetalol 20 mg IV now
   - will continue to monitor pt
s BP and HR to ensure that they are
   controlled
   # Dyspnea
   - question has been HTN emergency with pulmonary edema vs. infection
   - pt was afebrile overnight and patient says that her dyspnea has
   improved
   - blood cx + for GPC in pairs and clusters
 all other cultures still
   pending
   - need to restart vanc today (dosing based on level)
 Need ID approval
   - one other issue is the nodules on the pt
s CT
 this likely
   represents some other process that is going on in the background
   - pt does have crackles on exam this morning
 CXR looks improved this
   morning compared to previous
   # Cough
 chronic cough, which the patient says is improved/resolved
   - continue to follow CXR for changes
   # Ascites and Pleural and Pericardial Effusions
   - unsure of etiology
 SLE serositis vs. uermia vs. fluid overload
   - will hold off on paracentesis or thoracentesis at this point
   - will consult rheum on Mon
   # Chronic Abdominal Pain
   - continue current outpt pain regimen of po dilaudid, fentanyl patch,
   lidoacine patch
 seems that pt
s abdominal is not as easily controlled
   anymore.  Will go up on the patient
s PO dilaudid dose.
   - will follow BM
s and flatus, given pts h/o SBO recently
   # Anemia/Pancytopenia - chronic anemia, baseline pancytopenia, likely
   [**2-12**] CKD and SLE
   - seems that this is worse than pt
s baseline pancytopenia
 ddx
   includes lupus flare, medication rxn
   - will f/u rheum recs
   - continue to guaiac all stools, as pt did get blood during last admit
   and quickly came back with decreased Hct
   # ESRD on HD
 pt was dialyzed 3 times over the past 3 days
   - plan is to dialyze on Tues next
   - F/u renal recs
   - continue sevelamer.
   # H/o gastric ulcer
   - will continue her PPI.
   # SLE
 pt was kept on her home regimen of 4 mg prednisone PO daily
   - C3 low; C4 WNL
 essentially unchanged from values in [**5-19**]
   - [**Doctor First Name 1205**] pos
 titer pending
   # H/o SVC Thrombosis
   - INR goal of [**2-13**] (at goal)
   - continue warfarin at 3 mg daily.
   # Seizure Disorder
   - conitnue pt
s home dose of Keppra

The patient presented with dyspnea and hypertensive urgency.

24-hour events:
- The patient was initially going to be transferred to the floor but experienced increased blood pressure and abdominal pain, leading to the administration of labetalol IV and dilaudid IV.
- In the evening, the patient's pain improved, but she remained hypertensive and tachycardic, necessitating another dose of labetalol IV.
- In the morning, the patient's blood pressure and heart rate were still elevated, prompting another dose of labetalol IV.

Allergies:
- The patient has allergies to penicillins, resulting in a rash. She also experienced itching with Percocet (oral), morphine, and Vancomycin.

Lab results:
- Blood tests revealed elevated levels of creatinine (5.2), blood urea nitrogen (24 mEq/L), potassium (4.2 mEq/L), and glucose (90).

The patient has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He is allergic to penicillins, Percocet, morphine, and oxycodone. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 208/136 mmHg to 155/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient received labetalol IV for increased blood pressure and pain management with dilaudid IV. Despite these interventions, the patient's blood pressure and heart rate remained elevated, leading to additional doses of labetalol IV. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for abdominal pain.

Flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 2,190 mL of fluids since midnight, with an intake of 1,800 mL of PO and 390 mL of IVF. The patient's output includes 2,200 mL of total output, with 200 mL of urine output. The patient's fluid balance is -10 mL.
