","The patient is an 82-year-old woman with jaundice and a pancreatic lesion who underwent an ERCP with stenting. She is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and requires invasive ventilation. The differential diagnosis for her condition includes transient CHF, COPD, MI, aspiration pneumonia, and PE. The most likely cause would be acute pulmonary edema versus aspiration. 

She also has jaundice, likely due to an obstructive process with increased alkaline phosphatase, dilated bile ducts, and a pancreatic lesion. Pancreatic cancer is high on the differential. Awaiting cytology from ERCP brushings. 

The patient's hypotension may be preload-dependent, possibly due to dehydration, CHF, PE, or biliary sepsis. 

There are no significant abnormalities on recent TTE. 

The patient's rate control for atrial fibrillation is adequate for now. 

She is currently on multiple medications including phenylephrine, propofol, fentanyl, levofloxacin, and flagyl. 

She has several lines including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and 20-gauge line. 

She is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. 

Her code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman who presented with jaundice and a pancreatic lesion following an ERCP procedure. She experienced complications post-operation, including hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and receiving multiple medications. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has abnormal lab results indicating liver dysfunction, likely obstructive jaundice, and elevated CA-19-9 levels suggestive of pancreatic cancer. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with plans to wean her off sedation and extubate if tolerated. Further investigations are pending, including blood and urine cultures, as well as cytology from ERCP brushings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to various factors such as transient CHF, COPD, MI, aspiration pneumonia, or PE. Acute pulmonary edema seems more likely given the presence of effusion on the right side with RLL infiltrate seen on CXR.
2. Jaundice: The patient's yellowing of the skin and elevated liver enzymes suggest obstructive jaundice, which could be caused by a pancreatic lesion or pancreatic cancer. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be attributed to pre-load dependent causes like dehydration, CHF, PE, or biliary sepsis. Blood cultures and CVP monitoring are recommended to identify the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with jaundice and a pancreatic lesion following an ERCP procedure. He experienced post-operative hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation with a multi-lumen tube. He is receiving vasopressor support and sedation with propofol. The differential diagnosis for his hypoxic respiratory failure includes transient CHF, COPD, MI, aspiration pneumonia, and PE. Further investigations such as a chest X-ray, cardiac enzymes, and a CTA chest are planned to rule out PE and MI. Aspirin has been held due to lack of EKG changes. The patient's jaundice is likely obstructive with increased ALK, dilated bile ducts, and a pancreatic lesion. Pancreatic cancer is high on the differential. Awaiting cytology from ERCP brushings. Hypotension is suspected to be preload-dependent, possibly due to dehydration, CHF, PE, or biliary sepsis. Blood and urine cultures have been obtained, and CVP monitoring is planned. Levofloxacin and flagyl have been started. Rate control for atrial fibrillation is adequate. Coumadin has been held for 5 days post ERCP. Beta-blockers will be resumed when blood pressure stabilizes. The patient is NPO and requires nutritional support. Arterial and multi-lumen lines are in place. Prophylaxis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and hypertension (HTN). He was admitted for painless jaundice and a pancreatic mass. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) under general anesthesia, which resulted in the placement of a sphincterotomy and biliary stent. Post-procedure, the patient developed hypoxia and was intubated. He then became hypotensive, and the medical team placed him on pressors.

The patient has been in the ICU since admission, with various interventions and treatments. He has been on mechanical ventilation, initially on CPAP/PSV mode, and currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 122/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient's rhythm remains atrial fibrillation.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). His liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He was admitted with painless jaundice and a pancreatic mass, for which he underwent an ERCP procedure under general anesthesia. Post-procedure, he developed hypoxia and was intubated, then became hypotensive. Since admission to the ICU, the patient has required right internal jugular vein placement, remained on pressors (especially when propofol increased), and switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV).

24-hour events include starting arterial line, sputum culture, invasive ventilation, and multi-lumen catheter placement. The patient received antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole) within the past 24 hours. He is currently on infusions of phenylephrine and propofol. Other medications include fentanyl.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, normal vital signs, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen, and symmetric expansion of the chest. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated bilirubin levels, and normal blood glucose level. Other lab values are within normal range. Microbiology sputum culture shows no growth.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient is in acute respiratory failure due to effusion and possible infiltrate, possibly secondary to aspiration. He is on antibiotics and"

   FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 872**] of the bilateral common
   femoral,
   superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed. There is normal
   flow,
   compresibility and augmentation.
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
   Cxr [**4-19**] 9 am
   A single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent
   bilateral
   pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, worse on the right than
   the left.
   The findings are similar to that seen on [**2155-4-18**]. The support lines
   are
   unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomediastinal contours are
   unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 M w/ jaundice and pancreatic lesion s/p ERCP with stenting
   complicated by post-op hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Differential include transient CHF,
   COPD, MI, aspiration pneumonia, PE. Of these would favor acute
   pulmonary edema vs aspiration.
   - CXR showing effusion on right with RLL infiltrate, am CXR pending
   - CE neg x2
   - Will hold aspirin for now given lack of EKG changes
   - Sedation with propofol, will wean today to see if RSBI improves
   - Wean to extubate, tolerated PSV for now, will decrease propofol
   #Jaundice: Likely obstructive with incr ALK, dilated bile ducts and
   pancreas lesion. Pancreatic ca high on differential.  CA- 19-9 high.
   Awaiting cytology from ERCP brushings.
   - Trend LFTs , slightly down from prior
   -F/u cytology
   - Will speak with ERCP regarding further plan of action
   # Loose stool / ? c diff
   # decreased urine output
   # Hypotension: As hypotension followed intubation likely pre-load
   dependent either dehydrated, CHF, PE, biliary sepsis. Of note no
   significant AS on recent TTE.
   - Blood cultures, urine cultures
   - CVP monitoring ([**10-12**])
   - Wean Neo as tolerated
   - Levofloxacin/flagyl for now
   #Aifb: rate control adequate for now.
   - Hold coumadin for now (for 5 days per ERCP)
   - No ASA or NSAIDS per ERCP
   - Monitor on tele
   - Resume beta-blocker when blood pressure normalized as pt was
   requiring pressors overnight.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of biliary obstruction, respiratory failure, and lower extremity edema. The patient presented with hypoxia following an ERCP procedure for jaundice and a pancreatic lesion. 

Based on the provided information, the patient's medical complications can include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's differential includes transient CHF, COPD, MI, aspiration pneumonia, and PE. Given the findings of bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis on the chest X-ray, acute pulmonary edema seems more likely than aspiration.

2. Jaundice: The patient's jaundice is likely obstructive with increased alkaline phosphatase levels, dilated bile ducts, and a pancreatic lesion. Pancreatic cancer is high on the differential, and cytology from ERCP brushings is pending.

3. Loose stools and possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient started with loose stools, which raises suspicion for C. diff infection. Blood cultures and stool samples have been sent for testing.

4. Decreased urine output: The patient is experiencing decreased urine output, which can be attributed to various causes such as dehydration, hypotension, or acute kidney injury.

5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be preload-dependent and may be due to dehydration, congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary embolism (PE), or biliary"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of biliary obstruction, respiratory failure, and lower extremity edema. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and loose stools. The patient underwent an ERCP with stenting due to jaundice and pancreatic lesion. However, the procedure was complicated by post-operative hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be caused by bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Loose stools: The patient has been experiencing loose stools for six weeks. Possible causes include pancreatic insufficiency, mass effects (VIPoma, etc.), or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. C. diff is suspected due to the recent antibiotic treatment and the presence of hypotension and low urine output.
3. Decreased urine output: The patient's urine output is decreased, indicating possible hypovolemia or effective hypoperfusion to the kidneys. Trending creatinine levels and continuing treatment for hypotension are necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be caused by preload dependency, dehydration, congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary embolism (PE), or biliary sepsis. Repeat TTE and CTA for PE, as well as blood cultures and urine cultures, should be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of biliary obstruction, respiratory failure, and lower extremity edema. He presented with jaundice and a pancreatic lesion after undergoing ERCP with stenting. The patient developed post-operative hypoxia and required invasive ventilation. He was extubated yesterday but experienced hypoxic respiratory failure, with persistent bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis seen on chest X-ray. The patient also presented with hypotension and shock, requiring frequent boluses of normal saline (NS) to maintain adequate blood pressure and urine output. He was started on IV antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole) for suspected low-grade sepsis. The patient also had loose stools for six weeks, which could be due to pancreatic insufficiency, a mass effect (VIPoma, etc.), or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. C. diff testing was ordered. The patient's jaundice is likely obstructive with increased alkaline phosphatase (ALK) and dilated bile ducts, possibly due to pancreatic cancer. ERCP with stenting showed improvement, and cytology from ERCP brushings is pending. The patient's atrial fibrillation rate control is adequate for now. He is being monitored closely, and his ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been unstable, with frequent changes in vital signs and respiratory support. The patient was intubated initially but was successfully extubated on [**2155-4-19**] 12:03 PM. The patient's blood culture was taken at [**2155-4-19**] 09:37 AM, and he was started empirically on po vancomycin. The patient experienced loose stools and was sent for C. diff testing. Pressors (neo) were weaned off and on back and forth alternating with IVF (NS) boluses. The patient's central venous line was pulled back 4 cm. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole at [**2155-4-19**] 04:20 PM, levofloxacin at [**2155-4-19**] 10:00 PM, and vancomycin at [**2155-4-20**] 03:00 AM. The patient's vital signs have fluctuated, with a maximum temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate between 95-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67-73 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance shows a total in of 3,804 mL and total out of 710 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV and supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 298, and Ve of 7.3 L/min. The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed in several areas. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal creatinine, and elevated troponin T level. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient's imaging shows a chest X-ray taken on [**2155-4-18**] 07:12 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, altered mental status, and loose stools raise concerns for a possible infection. The blood culture taken at [**2155-4-19**] 09:37 AM should provide more information on potential bacterial causes. The patient's empiric treatment with vancomycin is appropriate given the suspicion of a hospital-acquired infection.

2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for pressors indicate possible septic shock. The fluctuating blood pressure readings and the need for repeated weaning and administration of pressors suggest ongoing hemodynamic instability.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Although the patient's creatinine levels are currently within normal range, the fluctuating fluid balance and potential for renal hypoperfusion due to septic shock could lead to the development of AKI. Monitoring the patient's renal function closely is essential.

4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient was intubated initially and received invasive ventilation, there is a risk for V"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of pancreatic mass who presented with hypotension and respiratory failure after undergoing ERCP. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently extubated, requiring minimal oxygen support. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable and required fluid resuscitation and intermittent pressors. There is also a concern for possible sepsis due to the timing of symptoms. The patient has been experiencing loose stools, and a test for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is pending. His urine output has been decreased, but his creatinine levels are stable. The patient is on anticoagulation therapy for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention measures including elevation of head of bed (HOB) and oral care. The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Although he has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, necessitating fluid resuscitation and the use of pressors. This may indicate underlying cardiovascular issues or septic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 M w/ jaundice and pancreatic lesion s/p ERCP with stenting
   complicated by post-op hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Extubated.  CXR showing effusion on
   right with RLL infiltrate.  Afebrile without cough, inclined to
   consider this unlikely infection, ? aspiration pneumonitis.  Sats are
   stable on 2.5L NC even after aggressive volume resuscitation
   - Cont monitor O2 sats
   # Hypotension / Shock
   Required frequent boluses of NS to miantain BPs. Now holding pressures
   well. Likely low grade sepsis in setting of biliary manipulation, now
   responding to IV antibiotics levofloxacin + flagyl.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely as recent TTE showed EF 55% without significant valvular
   disease.  Will continue to bolus as needed to maintain MAPS > 60 and
   urine output > 0.5 cc/kg/hour.  Low BP and pressors might have given
   mild insult to kidney; will f/u w/ ua/ urine culture.  Will eval
   cortisol for absolute adrenal insufficiency (if cortisol is < 5).  Hold
   on repeat TTE as unlikely new cardiac event w/ no CK leak or change in
   EKGs
   - IVFs
   - Cont antibiotics
   - F/u cortisol
   # Loose stool
   Patient has complained of loose stool x 6 weeks.  ? pancreatic
   insufficiency w/ mass vs secondary to mass effects (VIPoma, etc.) vs c
   diff.
   As for c diff, denies treatment w/ antibiotics over past 2 months; was
   started on [**4-18**] w/ levo / flagyl (IV).  Sending for c diff, negative
   x2, will send third; Diarrhea probably cause of low blood volume.
   - Changed to PO flagyl and hold off on further PO vancomycin for now.
   - If continues to worsen w/ abdominal exam-> will get KUB and possible
   Ct abdomen.
   #Jaundice:
   Likely obstructive with incr ALK, dilated bile ducts and pancreas
   lesion, improved s/p stent w/ ERCP. Pancreatic ca high on
   differential.  CA- 19-9 high.  Awaiting cytology from ERCP brushings.
   - Trend LFTs , continuing to decline
   - F/u cytology
   #Aifb: Has been in RVR with rates in the 110s and 120s.  Holding BB
   given low BPs.
   - Hold coumadin for now (for 5 days per ERCP), now day [**4-5**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with jaundice and pancreatic lesions who underwent an ERCP with stenting. She experienced post-operative hypoxia and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension/shock, loose stool, jaundice, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation. This can be a life-threatening condition if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension/shock: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating possible hypotension or shock. This can lead to decreased organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
3. Loose stool: The patient has been experiencing loose stools for six weeks. Possible causes include pancreatic insufficiency, mass effects (VIPoma, etc.), or Clostridium difficile infection. This can result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Jaundice: The patient's jaundice is likely due to an obstructive cause, possibly pancreatic cancer. This can lead to complications such as liver dysfunction and bile duct obstruction.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and embolic events. Close monitoring and anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of jaundice and pancreatic lesion who underwent an ERCP with stenting. The procedure was complicated by post-operative hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing loose stools for six weeks, which could be due to pancreatic insufficiency, secondary to the mass or other causes such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require close monitoring for oxygen saturation. The patient's blood pressure has been low, and they have required frequent boluses of normal saline to maintain blood pressure. The patient has been responding to intravenous antibiotics for suspected low-grade sepsis. Imaging shows persistent bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase levels, as well as a high CA-19-9 tumor marker. Cytology from ERCP brushings is pending. The patient's cortisol level is within normal range, ruling out adrenal insufficiency. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further evaluation and treatment plans are being considered based on the ongoing assessment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's post-operative hypoxia and respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or worsening of pleural effusions.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with jaundice and a pancreatic lesion, following an ERCP with stenting. The procedure was complicated by post-operative hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been in the ICU since admission and has experienced several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure but has been extubated. However, he developed acute shortness of breath during rounds this morning, which could indicate a possible infection or aspiration pneumonitis. Further investigation and management are required.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient required frequent boluses of normal saline to maintain blood pressures, suggesting possible low-grade sepsis secondary to biliary manipulation. He is currently responding to IV antibiotics (levofloxacin + flagyl). It is important to continue monitoring and managing his blood pressure to maintain adequate perfusion.

3. Loose stool: The patient has been experiencing loose stools for the past six weeks. Possible causes include pancreatic insufficiency with mass, secondary to mass effects (VIPoma, etc.), or Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff). C. diff testing has been negative twice, but a third test is pending. It is crucial to manage his diarrhea to prevent further hypovolemia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a pancreatic mass and obstructive jaundice who experienced complications from an ERCP procedure, resulting in respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient required temporary intubation and is currently being treated in the ICU.

24-hour events include a brief drop in systolic blood pressure to the 80s, which responded to 250 cc IV fluid administration. The patient's diet has been advanced, and they have tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) twice. Allergies were not reported, and the patient has received antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

Vital signs as of 12:21 PM on [date] show a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/84 to 97/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF), and central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg.

Fluid balance over the past 24 hours shows a total input of 3,159 mL, including 451 mL through nasogastric (NG) tube and 360 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF). Total output consists of 1,010 mL of blood products, 360 mL of urine, 360 mL of stool, and 650 mL of drainage from an unspecified source. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending.

Physical examination findings include a well-nourished appearance, no signs of cyanosis or clubbing, and warm skin without rashes or jaundice. Neurological assessment reveals attentive behavior, purposeful movement, and normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 13.4 to 15.8 thousand/mm3, slightly elevated hematocrit (Hct) levels, and normal platelet count (Plt). Blood chemistry tests show slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, low troponin-T levels, and elevated liver enzymes including alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Microbiology results from the nasogastric tube indicate the presence of bacteria, but C. diff testing is negative. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission, and review of systems is also unaltered except for respiratory distress mentioned earlier.

Assessment and plan include the patient's critical condition due to complications from the ERCP procedure. Respiratory distress is attributed to fluid overload, and the patient is receiving appropriate interventions. Hypotension"

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of pancreatic mass and obstructive jaundice who experienced complications after an ERCP procedure, including respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient was temporarily intubated due to respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/84 mmHg to 97/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 357 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 122 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. The patient also has a slightly low potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L and low magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures are negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (AF), for which he needs rate control. He developed bradycardia with a non-specific beta blocker, so diltiazem will be tried for rate control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's sudden onset of respiratory distress requires further investigation and treatment. A stat posteroanterior chest X-ray (CXR) has been ordered, along with nebulizer treatments. The need for IV Lasix"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of pancreatic mass and obstructive jaundice who underwent an ERCP procedure. Post-procedure, the patient developed respiratory failure and hypotension, requiring temporary intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory distress, hypotension, diarrhea (negative for Clostridium difficile), obstructive jaundice, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's abrupt onset of respiratory distress suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema. Further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis, and appropriate treatment such as nebulizers and IV Lasix should be administered.
2. Rapid Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rapid atrial fibrillation may be contributing to the respiratory distress. Rate control measures should be initiated, and the patient may require medication such as diltiazem for this purpose.
3. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, there is a history of hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented to maintain stable blood pressure levels.
4. Obstructive Jaundice: The patient's obstructive jaundice needs further follow-up, especially considering the pancreatic mass. Cytology follow-up may provide valuable information about the underlying cause.
5. Diarrhea: Despite being negative for Clostridium difficile, the patient's diarrhea should"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with jaundice and a pancreatic lesion who underwent an ERCP with stenting. The procedure was complicated by post-operative hypoxia. The patient's condition has been unstable with several complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension/shock, and loose stool.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient developed acute shortness of breath during rounds, and his oxygen saturation levels were stable on a nasal cannula but increased when he received more oxygen. This may indicate aspiration pneumonitis or infection.

2. Hypotension/shock: The patient required frequent boluses of normal saline to maintain blood pressure and is now holding pressures well. This could be due to low-grade sepsis in the setting of biliary manipulation, which is responding to IV antibiotics.

3. Loose stool: The patient has had complaints of loose stool for six weeks, which may be related to pancreatic insufficiency with mass, secondary to mass effects (VIPoma, etc.), or Clostridium difficile infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

4. Jaundice: The patient's jaundice is likely obstructive with increased alkaline phosphatase levels, dilated bile ducts, and a pancreatic lesion. Pancreatic cancer is high on the differential diagnosis. Awaiting cytology from ERCP brushings for confirmation.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of jaundice and pancreatic lesion who underwent ERCP with stenting. The patient experienced post-operative hypoxia and has been in the ICU for further management. The patient's condition is complicated by several issues, including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension/shock, loose stools, jaundice, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's acute onset of respiratory distress suggests the possibility of hypoxic respiratory failure. This could be due to aspiration pneumonitis or an infection. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been stable on a nasal cannula but may deteriorate if not closely monitored.
2. Hypotension/shock: The patient required frequent boluses of normal saline to maintain blood pressures, indicating possible low-grade sepsis. The patient's blood pressure remains stable with ongoing IV fluids and antibiotics.
3. Loose stools: The patient has complained of loose stools for six weeks, which could be due to pancreatic insufficiency, VIPoma, or Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has been tested for C. diff multiple times and will be retested, as diarrhea may contribute to hypovolemia.
4. Jaundice: The patient's jaundice is likely obstructive, considering the increased alkaline phosphatase levels, dilated bile ducts, and pancreatic lesion. Pancreatic cancer is high on the"

   82 M w/ jaundice and pancreatic lesion s/p ERCP with stenting
   complicated by post-op hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Extubated.  CXR showing effusion on
   right with RLL infiltrate.  Afebrile without cough, inclined to
   consider this unlikely infection, ? aspiration pneumonitis. Some SOB
   yesterday, responded to BB, nebs, lasix.  Has been stable since on 2-3L
   NC
   - Atrovent nebs, +/- xopenex given afib and concern for increased
   tachycardia
   - HR control as this may be exacerbating his SOB
   - Lasix x 1 as patient has rec
d volume over last 24 hours and has h/o
   diastolic failure
   - Cont monitor O2 sats
   - fevers, no cough or sputum production, RLL infiltrate less likely pna
   rather aspiration pneumonitis/atelectasis.  No abx coverage for PNA for
   now.
   # Hypotension / Shock: Resolving.  Initially required frequent boluses
   of NS to miantain BPs. Now holding pressures well. Likely low grade
   sepsis in setting of biliary manipulation, now responding to IV
   antibiotics levofloxacin + flagyl.  Cardiogenic shock unlikely as
   recent TTE showed EF 55% without significant valvular disease.  Will
   continue to bolus as needed to maintain MAPS > 60 and urine output >
   0.5 cc/kg/hour.  Cortisol wnl making absolute adrenal insufficiency
   unlikely.  Hold on repeat TTE as unlikely new cardiac event w/ no CK
   leak or change in EKGs.
   - IVFs prn
   - Cont levaquin for 7d course.
   # Loose stool:  Patient has complained of loose stool x 6 weeks.  ?
   pancreatic insufficiency w/ mass vs secondary to mass effects (VIPoma,
   etc.) vs c diff.   As for c diff, denies treatment w/ antibiotics over
   past 2 months; was started on [**4-18**] w/ levo / flagyl (IV).  3 sets c.
   diff toxin negative.
   - d/c  po flagyl as c. diff negative x 3.
   - No current abdominal pain, if develops pain on abd exam, can consider
   further imaging such as KUB and possible Ct abdomen.
   -immodium prn diarrhea, has been tapering off today.
   #Jaundice:  Likely obstructive with incr ALK, dilated bile ducts and
   pancreas lesion, improved s/p stent w/ ERCP. Pancreatic ca high on
   differential.  CA- 19-9 high.  Awaiting cytology from ERCP brushings.
   Have discussed likely diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with pt and
   daughter.  Would plan outpatient GI f/u if bx necessary.  If cytology
   from brushings definitive would arrange outpatient heme/one f/u for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with jaundice and a pancreatic lesion who underwent ERCP with stenting. The procedure was complicated by post-operative hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, which improved with nebs and lasix. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure have been stable throughout the day. There has been a drop in oxygen saturation levels during the afternoon, but the patient showed improvement after repositioning. The patient has been started on lopressor 12.5 mg to control heart rate. The patient and his daughter were informed about the likely diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and the plan to follow up on cytology results and discuss the possibility of biopsy if indicated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to post-operative hypoxia. Although extubated now, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially considering the presence of an effusion and right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and close observation for any signs of respiratory distress are essential.

2. Hypotension/shock: The patient required frequent boluses of normal saline to maintain blood pressure initially. Although the patient's condition is improving, there is still a risk of recurrent hypotension or shock, particularly in the setting of ongoing infection and possible sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and urine output is necessary.

   #Hypotension: stabilized, not requiring fluid boluses.
   #Diarrhea: Cdiff negative x 2.
   #Obstructive jaundice: cytology still pending.
   #Afib: Needs more rate control. Previously developed bradycardia with
   non specific beta blocker; will trial diltiazem
   Will discuss with pt's daughter and have conversation with pt as he is

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of pancreatic mass and obstructive jaundice who experienced respiratory failure and hypotension after an ERCP procedure. The patient required temporary intubation but is now on minimal oxygen supplementation. He also has atrial fibrillation, which needs better rate control. The patient's diarrhea was negative for Clostridium difficile infection twice. The obstructive jaundice cytology results are still pending. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's goals of care need to be discussed with his daughter, as he is not aware of the likely malignancy. Further workup for the obstructive jaundice will depend on the cytology results. The patient's current medications include furosemide, diltiazem, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and metoprolol. The patient is planned to be transferred to the floor after discussion with his daughter."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with obstructive jaundice s/p ERCP complicated by resp
   failure/hypotension temporarily requiring intubation. Abd CT did not
   show pancreatic mass, though ERCP obstructing stricture suggesting
   mass. On levofloxacin s/p ERCP. Markedly elevated CA-19-9
   #Respiratory distress- improved with tx afib, lasix. Now on minimal
   oxygen supplementation.
   #Hypotension: stabilized, not requiring fluid boluses.
   #Diarrhea: Cdiff negative x 2.
   #Obstructive jaundice: cytology still pending.
   Will discuss with pt's daughter and have conversation with pt as he is
   not aware of likely malignancy. We need to determine his goals in terms
   of aggressiveness of further workup if cytology unrevealing.
   Safe for tx to floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of pancreatic mass and obstructive jaundice, who underwent an ERCP procedure that was complicated by respiratory failure and hypotension requiring intubation. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulation therapy. His respiratory distress has improved with treatment, and he is now on minimal oxygen supplementation. His hypotension has also stabilized and is no longer requiring fluid boluses. The patient's diarrhea has been ruled out as Clostridium difficile infection. His obstructive jaundice requires further evaluation with cytology pending. The patient's family has been informed about the likely malignancy, and discussions regarding the patient's goals for further workup will be had. The patient is considered safe for transfer to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to the complications of the ERCP procedure. Although his respiratory distress has improved with treatment, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if his underlying condition worsens or if he develops any new complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension was initially stabilized and no longer requires fluid boluses. However, there is still a risk of recurrent hypotension if his cardiovascular status deteriorates or if he develops any new complications.
3. Malignancy-related complications: Given the patient's history of pancreatic mass and obstructive jaundice"
