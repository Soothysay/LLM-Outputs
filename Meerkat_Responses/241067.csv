","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to triple-vessel disease. He is currently chest pain-free.

Medical Complications:
1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which is characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and potentially a heart attack.

2. ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI): The patient experienced a STEMI, which is a type of heart attack caused by a complete blockage of one of the coronary arteries. It results in significant damage to the heart muscle if not promptly treated.

3. Triple-Vessel Disease: The patient's coronary angiography revealed three-vessel disease, indicating blockages or narrowing in all three major coronary arteries. This condition requires further intervention and management.

4. Left Anterior Descending (LAD) Stenting: The patient underwent stenting of the LAD artery, which is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), underwent cardiac catheterization, and subsequently received a bare-metal stent (BMS) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to triple vessel disease. The patient is currently chest pain-free.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and underwent stenting for triple vessel disease. There is a risk of recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, or the need for further revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

2. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has hypercholesterolemia, which increases the risk of atherosclerosis progression and subsequent cardiovascular events.

3. ESRD on HD: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis. There is a risk of complications related to dialysis access, infection, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia.

4. CVA: The patient has a history of CVA, which increases the risk of stroke recurrence.

5. Left leg ulcer: The patient has a chronic left leg ulcer, which may require wound care management to"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), for which he underwent cardiac catheterization and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient's current condition includes being febrile overnight and experiencing hypoxia with shortness of breath (SOB), requiring nebulizers and improvement. He was also hypotensive in the 90s, but was able to undergo dialysis and have 3 liters removed. This morning, the patient denies chest pain, SOB, and feels tired. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 76 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 97/47 mmHg to 143/125 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92%. 

Physical examination reveals a somnolent but well-appearing man in no apparent distress. He is oriented to person, month, and year. His sclera are anicteric, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light),"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 27-inch tall male who weighs 98.5 kg. He has been admitted to the ICU due to a medical event. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. However, it is mentioned that he underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have extensive regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD), specifically in the mid-LAD distribution. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 25-30%. The patient also has mild aortic regurgitation, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and mild mitral regurgitation. He is scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on Wednesday.

The patient has a positive guaiac test, indicating the presence of blood in the stool. A chest X-ray reveals a possible right hilar mass, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest has been ordered to further evaluate this finding. The patient's ultrasound shows moderate/severe stenosis in the left internal carotid artery (ICA), with an estimated 60-69% narrowing. There is no significant stenosis observed in the right ICA. The patient's wound care status is pending, and his creatine kinase (CK) levels are trending downward.

The patient experienced an episode of hypoxia and shortness of breath overnight, prompting the administration of IV morphine, nebulizers, and nitroglycer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-inch tall, 98.5 kg man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has extensive regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD), specifically in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) distribution. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 25-30%. The patient also has mild aortic regurgitation, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and mild mitral regurgitation. He is scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on Wednesday.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 76 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 97/47 mmHg to 143/125 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 98.5 kg.

Physical examination reveals a somnolent but otherwise well-appearing man who is oriented to person, month, and year. His sclera are anicteric, pupils are equal and reactive, conjunctiva are pink, and there is no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck is supple without jugular venous distention (JVD). Cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with distant heart sounds. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs are appreciated. Lung examination reveals unlabored respirations without crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with a lower left-midline scar from a previous appendectomy. Extremity examination shows no femoral bruits, but there is a palpable thrill and audible bruit over the left arm arteriovenous (AV) fistula. The right femoral area is soft without ecchymosis or hematoma, and 2+ femoral pulses are palpable bilaterally. Skin examination reveals ulceration on the left anterior skin with eschar and granulation tissue, as well as chronic skin changes of bilateral lower extremities consistent with stasis dermatitis.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 17000 cells/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, glucose of 99 mg/dL, creatinine of 8.0 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, calcium of 8.0 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL, and phosphate of 5.5 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels have been elevated, indicating myocardial injury. Other lab values are within"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with chest pain and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have triple-vessel disease, for which he received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient's current condition includes febrile overnight, with blood cultures and urine cultures sent. He had an episode of hypoxia and shortness of breath, and was given intravenous morphine, nebs, and nitro, followed by return to the hemodynamic monitoring (HD). His vital signs show a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. His general appearance is somnolent but otherwise well-appearing, with no appreciable jugular venous pressure (JVP). 

On physical examination, his heart sounds are distant, with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Lung examination reveals unlabored respirations with clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or tenderness. Extremity examination reveals no femoral bruits, a palpable thrill and audible bruit in the left arm arteriovenous (AV) fistula, and soft and non-ecchymotic right femoral area with 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally. He has ulceration on the left anterior skin with eschar and granulation tissue, as well as chronic skin changes of bilateral lower extremities consistent with statis dermatitis. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 170 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 10.2 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 30.4%, platelet count of 160 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 36 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 9.4 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia (K+ of 3.6 mEq/L), hypernatremia (Na+ of 138 mEq/L), and hypercalcemia (Ca++ of 10.2 mg/dL). Cardiac biomarkers are elevated, with troponin-T levels ranging from 12.68 to 19.10 ng/mL. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, while album"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the omohyoid artery, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from outside hospital (OSH) and subsequently underwent bare-metal stent placement in the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- The patient began experiencing a mixture of bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and melena during the morning. His heparin infusion was stopped, and he remains on aspirin. A computed tomography (CT) torso was deferred for the day due to this. The patient's systolic blood pressures were on the low side in the 80s to 90s but remained stable. His hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 30.4 to 26.1, and after receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC), it was 27.5. He received a total of 2 units of PRBC. A gastrointestinal (GI) evaluation concluded that it was most consistent with a lower GI bleed, possibly from watershed ischemia. The plan is to perform a CT tomography to identify the cause. The patient is now on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient began to have a mix of BRBPR and melena during the morning.
   His heparin gtt was stopped.  He remains on ASA.  The CT torso was
   deferred today due to this.  His SBP's were on the low side in the 80's
   to 90's, but remained stable.  His Hct dropped from 30.4 to 26.1, after
   1 unit of PRBC it was 27.5.  He was given a total of 2 units PRBC.  GI
   evaluated him and felt that it was most consistent with a lower GI
   bleed, perhaps from watershed ischemia.  The plan is to get the CT t/m
   and see if it identifies a cause.  They are reluctant to do an EGD
   given his clinical condistion.  He is now on a po PPI [**Hospital1 **].
   This am he continues to have a slow leakage of dark maroonish stool,
   but it is slowing down.  Denies CP, SOB, dizziness, or abdominal pain.

   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient had a mix of BRBPR and dark
   stool concerning for melena yesterday.  His Hct dropped from 30 to 26
   and only rose to 29.4 with 2 units of blood.  He continues to have
   slight oozing of dark stool today.  GI evaluated the patient and felt
   his GI bleed was very likely from a lower GI source such as bowel
   ischemia, diverticulosis, or possibly cancer (especially given his
   recent 100 lb weight loss).  GI feels the patient is at very high risk
   for both colonoscopy or EGD.  The patient
s SBP have been low in the
   80
s to 100
s, however he has remained Hemodynamically stable, making a
   brisk UGIB unlikely.  The heparin gtt was stopped yesterday when he
   started to bleed.
   -  Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   -  Patient will go for a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for
   possible causes of LGIB.
   -  Will check Hct q6h and transfuse for Hct < 30 given recent ischemia.
   -  Active type and screen, 2 PIV

   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort two
   days ago at dialysis, possibly flash pulmonary edema.
   - Given his recent GI bleed, unlikely to go for CABG in the near future
   (as this would require a heparin bolus).
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - After discussion on rounds today, it was decided to restart him on
   Plavix (as the heparin gtt was stopped) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - Can consider stenting the LAD instead of CABG depending on the cause
   of his bleed and how long it lasts.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a recent myocardial infarction (STEMI). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting in a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 30.4 to 26.1. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and his hemoglobin concentration increased to 27.5. He continues to have slow leakage of dark maroonish stool but is hemodynamically stable. A CT torso with contrast is planned to evaluate potential causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's blood pressure has been on the lower side, ranging from the 80s to 100s, but remains stable. His heart rate has been relatively stable, ranging from 66 to 76 beats per minute. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, and the patient's oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's weight has decreased significantly, and malignancy or metabolic causes should be considered. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of melena and a drop in hemoglobin concentration. This may"

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo M with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, CVA p/w chest
   pain and STEMI, v. fib X 3 at OSH, resolved with shock, transferred
   from OSH for cardiac cath, now s/p LAD BMS stent with 3v disease.

   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient had a mix of BRBPR and dark
   stool concerning for melena yesterday.  His Hct dropped from 30 to 26
   and only rose to 29.4 with 2 units of blood.  He continues to have
   slight oozing of dark stool today.  GI evaluated the patient and felt
   his GI bleed was very likely from a lower GI source such as bowel
   ischemia, diverticulosis, or possibly cancer (especially given his
   recent 100 lb weight loss).  GI feels the patient is at very high risk
   for both colonoscopy or EGD.  The patient
s SBP have been low in the
   80
s to 100
s, however he has remained Hemodynamically stable, making a
   brisk UGIB unlikely.  The heparin gtt was stopped yesterday when he
   started to bleed.
   -  Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   -  Patient will go for a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for
   possible causes of LGIB.
   -  Will check Hct q6h and transfuse for Hct < 30 given recent ischemia.

   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort two
   days ago at dialysis, possibly flash pulmonary edema.
   - Given his recent GI bleed, unlikely to go for CABG in the near future
   (as this would require a heparin bolus).
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - After discussion on rounds today, it was decided to restart him on
   Plavix (as the heparin gtt was stopped) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - Can consider stenting the LAD instead of CABG depending on the cause
   of his bleed and how long it lasts.

   # PUMP: Echo with LVEF 25-30%, with near akinesis of distal
 of septum
   and anterior walls, distal inferior wall.  Apex mildly aneursymal and

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and previous fibrillation. The patient presented with chest pain and had a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement for a lesion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient has experienced several complications since admission. Firstly, he had a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which resulted in a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 30 to 26 and further decreased to 29.4 after transfusion of 2 units of blood. The patient continues to have slight oozing of dark stool. The attending gastroenterologist (GI) suspects a lower GI source such as bowel ischemia, diverticulosis, or possibly cancer, especially considering the patient's recent significant weight loss. 

The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) has been low but remains hemodynamically stable, making upper GI bleeding less likely. Heparin was stopped when the bleeding started. The plan is to appreciate the GI consult, perform a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for possible causes of lower GI bleeding, monitor hemoglobin concentration every 6 hours, and transfuse if it falls below 30. An active type and screen was also initiated.

Regarding the patient's coronary arteries, he has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), for which he underwent cardiac catheterization and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient also has a gastrointestinal bleed, likely caused by carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction. He is currently being monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to his unstable condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's ongoing bleeding from the rectosigmoid junction carcinoma poses a significant risk. Continuous monitoring for signs of ischemia and active bleeding is necessary. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is planned for tissue diagnosis and potential intervention.

2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and recent episodes of chest discomfort during dialysis suggest ongoing ischemia. Further evaluation is required to determine the need for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or additional stenting procedures.

3. Heart failure: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reduced at 25-30%, indicating impaired cardiac function. Close monitoring for symptoms of heart failure and appropriate management with medications such as beta-blockers and statins"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient presented with chest pain and a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to triple vessel disease. Subsequently, the patient experienced a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which was identified as likely carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction on a CT scan.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg, heart rate of 69 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is currently on multiple medications including pantoprazole, aspirin, Plavix, a beta-blocker, and a statin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low, indicating anemia. The white blood cell count is within normal range. Troponin T levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial injury.

The patient's physical examination reveals a non-pitting edema in the lower"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with chest pain and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient experienced multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation (v. fib) at the outside hospital (OSH) and was transferred for cardiac catheterization. Afterward, the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to triple-vessel disease. The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30% and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

On admission, the patient had a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which resolved without blood transfusion. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals an ulceration on the left anterior skin with eschar and granulation tissue, chronic skin changes of bilateral lower extremities consistent with static dermatitis, and no other significant findings.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with chest pain and a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He was previously hospitalized at another facility for cardiac catheterization and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient also had a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed while on heparin therapy, which was initially suspected to be caused by colorectal cancer; however, further evaluation, including a flexible sigmoidoscopy, did not reveal any mass or lesion. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been stable, and he has not experienced any further episodes of bloody stools.

The patient's medical history includes chronic systolic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%. His physical examination revealed an aneurysmal and dyskinetic apex with near akinesis of the distal septum and anterior walls, as well as normal contraction of the remaining segments. The patient's cardiac catheterization showed three-vessel coronary artery disease, for which he is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Prior to CABG, the patient requires carotid artery stenting due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo M with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, CVA p/w chest
   pain and STEMI, v. fib X 3 at OSH, resolved with shock, transferred
   from OSH for cardiac cath, now s/p LAD BMS stent with 3v disease while
   awaiting CABG had a lower GI bleed.
   .
   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  Pt started to have GI bleed when heparin was
   started.  CT scan showed thickening at rectosigmoid junction concerning
   for cancer, however a flex sig yesterday by GI showed no mass and only
   erythema at the recto-sigmoid junction which was likely secondary to
   ischemia.  Hct is stable at 32 today and no further passage of bloody
   stools.  Pt
s daughter reports that he had colonoscopy within the last
   3 months which did not show etiology of bleed.
   - Daily HCT
   - Active type and screen, 2 PIV
   - will need outpatient colonoscopy and further evaluation as inpatient
   if pt starts to bleed again
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort with
   dialysis on [**2110-11-10**], none since.
   - As the patient is no longer having a GI bleed and its origin was from
   ischemia, the patient can likely have his CABG next week.
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - Continue on Plavix (started [**2110-11-12**]) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - will need to discuss with CT surgery regarding potential stent to
   carotids given CT findings
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with chronic systolic heart failure - Echo with LVEF
   25-30%, with near akinesis of distal
 of septum and anterior walls,
   distal inferior wall.  Apex mildly aneursymal and dyskinetic and
   remaining segments contract normally.
   - Continue bblocker and statin
   - no ACE given his recent hypotension, but would restart after CABG.

   # RHYTHM:  S/P v. fib X 3 at OSH with shock X 3. Has been in NSR since
   without episodes of VT on telemetry.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization and subsequent placement of a bare metal stent in the left anterior descending artery due to a STEMI. The patient also has a history of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which was initially suspected to be caused by cancer but was later determined to be secondary to ischemia. 

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 mmHg to 77/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable blood pressure and adequate oxygenation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with clear lungs, supple neck, and no jugular venous distention. The patient has chronic skin changes consistent"
