   Assessment and Plan
   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy, currently
   sedated, intubated and on pressors.
   1. HYPOTENSION/ SEPSIS- hypotension is likely due to sepsis as
   pressures not responding to fluid boluses. CVP goal is [**8-28**]; however,
   CVP measurements have been unreliable in this patient. Surgery wants to
   run maintenance IVF LR @150cc/hr for 2L. Would prefer to give fluid
   boluses and wean off levophed but will follow surgery's management.
   Likely hypotensive from sepsis from known infection- due to
   cholangitis. not febrile on admission, but had RUQ pain and T bili 4.4
   (jaundice). Also has hypotension and renal failure, but unable to
   assess mental status so could be Charcot's triad +/- [**Last Name (un) 6321**] pentad.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.
   -- continue antibiotic mgt Zosyn which will cover GNRs from intestinal
   flora translocation and anaerobes
   -- continue vancomycin for known GPC
s in clusters-> await speciation
   as if VRE will need linezolid
   -- fluid boluses, wean off pressors
   -- need TEE when no longer bacteremic to r/o endocarditis as blood cx
   are growing GPCs in clusters (likely staph)
   -- f/u surveillance BCx daily
   -- send UCx, U/A, Ulytes, BCx
   2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- Respiratory distress due to body habitus- has
   short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound
   of his pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional
   breaths. Other considerations could include pneumonia, atelectasis
   ARDS, volume overload states; however, primary pulmonary process is
   less likely given known cholangitis/ bacteremia. CXR does not show
   consolidative process or b/l fluffy infiltrates and most recent PaO2/
   FiO2 ratio= 130/0.5-> 260 (<200 for ARDS) Does meet criteria for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
   though as <300.
   -- keep intubated on current settings, try to wean FiO2 to 40% while
   following serial ABGs
   -- keep sedation on current settings
   --need CXR in AM to confirm placement ETT and NGT (CXR post-tubation
   revealed ETT 2.8cm above carina, NGT not well visualized, wouldn't use
   it yet). He was a difficult intubation and anesthesia's initial attempt
   resulted in R mainstem bronchus intubation, so low threshold for
   re-imaging if acutely worsens on vent settings
   3. OLIGURIA- poor urine output could be [**2-18**] poor renal perfusion from
   hypotension leading to ATN or due to volume depletion.
   -- will check urine lytes and Eo's, urine osms
   -- if ATN, unlikely to respond to fluid boluses
   -- will trend BUN/Cr

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] awaiting SICU x-fer
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of common bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient is currently sedated, intubated, and on pressors.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis as pressures are not responding to fluid boluses. The central venous pressure (CVP) goal is between 8-28 mmHg; however, CVP measurements have been unreliable in this patient. Surgery wants to run maintenance intravenous fluids at a rate of 150 cc/hr for 2 liters. It is desired to give fluid boluses and wean off levophed, but the management will follow surgery's instructions. The patient is hypotensive from sepsis caused by known infection due to cholangitis. He is not febrile on admission, but had right upper quadrant pain and total bilirubin of 4.4 (jaundice). The patient also has hypotension and renal failure, but his mental status cannot be assessed accurately, so it could be Charcot's triad +/- [Last Name (un)] pentad. 

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to his body habitus. He has a short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound of his pannus, which could cause the ventilator to deliver additional breaths. Other considerations for respiratory distress include pneumonia, atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), volume overload states; however, primary pulmonary process is less likely given the known cholangitis/bacteremia. The chest X-ray does not show consolidative process or bilateral fluffy infiltrates and most recent PaO2/FiO2 ratio = 130/0.5 -> 260 (<200 for ARDS). The patient meets criteria for [Doctor Last Name] though as <300.

3. Oliguria: The patient has poor urine output, which could be due to poor renal perfusion from hypotension leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or due to volume depletion. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

- Sepsis leading to septic shock
- Acute respiratory failure
- Acute kidney injury (AKI)
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Stress ulcers
- Endocarditis

Further assessments and interventions should include:

- Continuing antibiotic management with Zosyn, which will cover gram-negative rods from intestinal flora translocation and anaerobes
- Continuing vancomycin for known gram-positive cocci in clusters -> await speciation
- Fluid boluses, wean off pressors
- Need transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) when no longer bacteremic to rule out endocarditis
- Follow-up surveillance blood cultures daily
- Send urinalysis, urine culture, electrolytes, blood cultures
- Keep intubated on current settings, try to wean FiO2 to 40% while following serial arterial blood gases (ABGs)
- Keep sedation on current settings
- Need chest X-ray in the morning to confirm placement of endotracheal tube (ETT) and nasogastric tube (NGT)

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy, currently
   sedated, intubated and on pressors.
   1. HYPOTENSION/ SEPSIS- hypotension is likely due to sepsis as
   pressures not responding to fluid boluses. CVP goal is [**8-28**]; however,
   CVP measurements have been unreliable in this patient. Surgery wants to
   run maintenance IVF LR @150cc/hr for 2L. Would prefer to give fluid

   Likely hypotensive from sepsis from known infection- due to
   cholangitis. not febrile on admission, but had RUQ pain and T bili 4.4
   (jaundice). Also has hypotension and renal failure, but unable to
   assess mental status so could be Charcot's triad +/- [**Last Name (un) 6321**] pentad.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.
   -- continue antibiotic mgt Zosyn which will cover GNRs from intestinal
   flora translocation and anaerobes
   -- continue vancomycin for known GPC
s in clusters-> await speciation
   as if VRE will need linezolid
   -- fluid boluses, wean off pressors
   -- need TEE when no longer bacteremic to r/o endocarditis as blood cx
   are growing GPCs in clusters (likely staph)
   -- f/u surveillance BCx daily
   -- send UCx, U/A, Ulytes, BCx
   2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- Respiratory distress due to body habitus- has
   short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound
   of his pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional
   breaths. Other considerations could include pneumonia, atelectasis
   ARDS, volume overload states; however, primary pulmonary process is
   less likely given known cholangitis/ bacteremia. CXR does not show
   consolidative process or b/l fluffy infiltrates and most recent PaO2/
   FiO2 ratio= 130/0.5-> 260 (<200 for ARDS) Does meet criteria for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
   though as <300.
   -- keep intubated on current settings, try to wean FiO2 to 40% while
   following serial ABGs
   -- keep sedation on current settings
   --need CXR in AM to confirm placement ETT and NGT (CXR post-tubation
   revealed ETT 2.8cm above carina, NGT not well visualized, wouldn't use
   it yet). He was a difficult intubation and anesthesia's initial attempt
   resulted in R mainstem bronchus intubation, so low threshold for
   re-imaging if acutely worsens on vent settings
   -- pt did not tolerate trial of PS 5/5, would keep current vent
   settings the same and possibly try to wean to PS 5/5 later today, need
   to treat underlying acute lung injury for successful extubation
   3. OLIGURIA- poor urine output could be [**2-18**] poor renal perfusion from
   hypotension leading to ATN or due to volume depletion.  Patient
s urine
   output seems to be tapering off, and is no longer responsive to fluid
   boluses, which could mark the progression into ATN.
   -- will check urine lytes and Eo's, urine osms
   -- if ATN, unlikely to respond to fluid boluses
   -- will trend BUN/Cr

","The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis, admitted for cholangitis. He underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of common bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient is currently sedated, intubated, and on pressors.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, as pressures are not responding to fluid boluses. The central venous pressure (CVP) goal is 8-28, but CVP measurements have been unreliable in this patient. Surgery wants to run maintenance intravenous fluid lactated Ringer's at a rate of 150cc/hr for 2 liters. It is preferred to give fluid boluses and wean off levophed but will follow surgery's management. The patient is likely hypotensive from sepsis due to known infection, specifically cholangitis. He is not febrile on admission, but had right upper quadrant pain and total bilirubin of 4.4 (jaundice). He also has hypotension and renal failure, but unable to assess mental status, which could be Charcot's triad +/- [Last Name (un)] pentad.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male admitted with cholangitis and now with sepsis and
   respiratory failure.  He did have ERCP resulting in drainage of
   obstruction and stent placement and now is in with evidence of
   significant sepsis secondary to the cholangitis seen.  Across the past
   12 hours with adequate volume support patient has been able to wean off
   of pressors.  The concerning issue is that
   1)SEPSIS--Secondary to cholangitis, improved to have pressors off at
   this time.  This may well be related to improved volume suppport,
   adequate antibiotics and decompression of biliary tree.  Will
   -Maintain even/positive fluid balance across today
   -Will continue with Vanco/Zosyn
   -Will follow up cultures across time and expect resolution
   2)Respiratory Failure-Acute-Patient with increased respiratory effort,
   patient with ongoing infection and re-intubated.  He now has had
   requirement for ongoing ventilatory support in the setting of
   persistent infection.
   -This appears to be respiratory failure that is persistent in the
   setting of ongoing infection and significant volume support
   -Return to A/C with PEEP=8 and continue to support across time
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   This is likey a combination of pre-renal insult as well as ATN.
   He has now moved to anuria
   Will check renal ultrasound
   -Will evaluate urine for casts to better define source of failure and
   expectation for improvement over time

","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted with cholangitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which resulted in the drainage of the obstruction and stent placement. However, the patient is now experiencing significant sepsis secondary to the cholangitis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 107/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, right lower extremity edema, and dullness in the chest. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 2.4 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. Blood cultures were initially positive for gram-positive cocci but have since become negative. Imaging shows improvement in pulmonary edema.

The patient's current assessment and plan include three main issues: sepsis secondary to cholangitis, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The sepsis has improved with adequate volume support, appropriate antibiotics, and decompression of the biliary tree. The respiratory failure is ongoing due to persistent infection and significant volume support. The acute renal failure is likely a combination of pre-renal insult and acute tubular necrosis, with the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy, currently
   intubated and sedated.
   1. HYPOTENSION/ SEPSIS- Hypotension now resolving with current
   treatments, CVP
s have been 17-26, although have been unreliable in the
   past in this patient.  Gave 3L LR yesterday to maitain BP and urine
   output and have weaned pressors.  Likely he was hypotensive from sepsis
   from known infection- due to cholangitis. not febrile on admission, but
   had RUQ pain and T bili 4.4 (jaundice). Also has renal failure, but
   unable to assess mental status so could be Charcot's triad +/-
   [**Last Name (un) 6321**] pentad. Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction
   of gallstones and purulent material.
   -- continue antibiotic mgt Zosyn which will cover GNRs from intestinal
   flora translocation and anaerobes, although no pathogen has been
   identified
   -- continue vancomycin for now because GPC
s in clusters, but with
   final susceptibilities will change to nafcillin if MSSA
   -- fluid boluses as needed
   -- TEE today to r/o endocarditis as blood cx are growing likely MSSA
   -- f/u surveillance BCx daily
   -- if additional positive blood cultures, consider d/c of right IJ and
   will culture tip
   2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- Respiratory distress due to body habitus- has
   short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound
   of his pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional
   breaths. Other considerations could include pneumonia, atelectasis
   ARDS, volume overload states; however, primary pulmonary process is
   less likely given known cholangitis/ bacteremia. CXR does not show
   consolidative process or b/l fluffy infiltrates and most recent PaO2/
   FiO2 ratio= 130/0.5-> 260 (<200 for ARDS) Does meet criteria for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
   though as <300.
   -- keep intubated on current settings, try to wean FiO2 to 40% while
   following serial ABGs
   -- keep sedation on current settings
   --need CXR in AM to confirm placement ETT and NGT (CXR post-tubation
   revealed ETT 2.8cm above carina, NGT not well visualized, wouldn't use
   it yet). He was a difficult intubation and anesthesia's initial attempt
   resulted in R mainstem bronchus intubation, so low threshold for
   re-imaging if acutely worsens on vent settings
   -- pt did not tolerate trial of PS 5/5, would keep current vent
   settings the same and possibly try to wean to PS 5/5 later today, need
   to treat underlying acute lung injury for successful extubation
   3. OLIGURIA- poor urine output could be [**2-18**] poor renal perfusion from
   hypotension leading to ATN or due to volume depletion.  Patient
s urine
   output seems to be tapering off, and is no longer responsive to fluid
   boluses, which could mark the progression into ATN.
   -- will check urine lytes and Eo's, urine osms
   -- if ATN, unlikely to respond to fluid boluses
   -- will trend BUN/Cr

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient is currently sedated and intubated.

24-hour events:
- ID: Continued vancomycin despite preliminary cultures showing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Measured vancomycin trough prior to the next dose. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was ordered to evaluate for endocarditis and define antibiotic course. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was not informative due to the patient's body habitus. Two additional blood cultures were ordered for the next day.
- Renal: Muddy brown casts suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). No current indication for hemodialysis (HD), but renal function will be closely monitored. May need HD in the future. Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis and normal resistive indices.
- No blood culture at outside hospital (OSH).
- The patient underwent placement of an esophageal balloon, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased from 8 to 15 cmH2O, and tidal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient is currently sedated and intubated.

24-hour events:
- The patient's ID was consulted regarding antibiotic management. It was recommended to continue vancomycin for now, despite preliminary cultures showing growth of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus. The recommendation is to maintain a trough level prior to the next dose and perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate for endocarditis and define the antibiotic course. Two additional blood cultures were ordered for the next day.
- [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted regarding muddy brown casts seen in the urine, which were consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). No current indication for hemodialysis (HD) was found, but the doctor recommended trending creatinine levels and may need HD in the future. Continuing to follow the recommendations.
- No blood cultures were obtained outside the hospital.
- The patient underwent placement of an esophageal balloon, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased from 8 to 15, with tidal volume decreased to 500 mL from 600 mL (8 cc/kg).
- The patient experienced hypoglycemia in the evening and received a dextrose 50% infusion.
- Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of hydronephrosis. Normal resistive indices were observed.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) at 7 am showed pH 7.39, PaCO2 33 mmHg, PaO2 99 mmHg, HCO3- 21 mEq/L, and base excess -3 mEq/L. Lytes were stable.
- Fractional excretion of sodium (Fena) was 0.3, suggesting a possible pre-renal component, so 2 liters of lactated Ringer's (LR) were given.
- Hematocrit (Hct) was 28.0 at 10 pm, which was stable.
- PEEP was lowered from 15 to 12, and the patient tolerated pressure support (PS). Pending ABG results.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Vancomycin on [**2115-12-11**] at 08:00 AM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2115-12-12**] at 03:03 AM.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old man admitted with cholangitis, now with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, septic shock (now resolved), and MRSA bacteremia. 

Respiratory Failure:
- The patient has been placed on esophageal-pressure guided PEEP settings, indicating a significant extrathoracic component.
- He is being positioned more upright to assess his respiratory status.
- The intubation record should be reviewed, and the possibility of extubating the patient to PAP in the next few days or considering a tracheostomy if difficult airway is present should be considered.
- A mini-Bal and sputum culture should be performed given secretions. Antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being given, and additional coverage for gram-negative bacteria may be considered if there is a spike in infection.

Acute Renal Failure:
- The patient's urine output is improving, and creatinine levels have plateaued. He is likely entering the post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuretic phase.

MRSA Bacteremia:
- Since the line was placed while the patient had a high-grade bacteremia with Staph, the line will be resited.

TEE (Transesophageal Echocardiogram):
- A TEE will be performed in the next few days.

Communication and Healthcare Proxy:
- The patient's primary care physician (PCP) will be contacted to identify any known healthcare proxy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man admitted with cholangitis and now presents with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, septic shock (now resolved), and MRSA bacteremia. He is currently in the ICU and has undergone various interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and changes in mental status will be important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Preventive measures such as compression stockings and low molecular weight heparin should be implemented.
3. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and pressure from bedridden positioning can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate skin care are essential in preventing this complication.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-related urinary tract infections (CRUTIs).
5. Delirium: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at risk of developing delirium. Monitoring for altered mental status, agitation, and disorientation is necessary.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's acute renal failure may progress or be complicated by further kidney dysfunction."

   For his respiratory failure
          esophageal-pressure guided PEEP settings, suggesting
   substantive extrathoracic component
          will again attempt to get him more upright and assess
   respiratory status
          review intubation record; might be a reasonable candidate to
   extubate to PAP in next few days, or to consider tracheostomy if
   difficult airway.
          Follow-up respiratory cultures.
          Decrease Vt and allow pCO2 to rise to promote respiratory
   drive.
   Acute renal failure
   Appears to be be ATN, now entering post-ATN diuretic phase.  Will give

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man admitted with cholangitis (now s/p ERCP) now with
          Respiratory failure
          Acute renal failure
          Septic shock (now resolved)
          MRSA bacteremia
   For his respiratory failure
          esophageal-pressure guided PEEP settings, suggesting
   substantive extrathoracic component
          attempt to get him more upright and assess respiratory
   status
          review intubation record; might be a reasonable candidate to
   extubate to PAP in next few days, or to consider tracheostomy if
   difficult airway.
          Check mini-Bal and sputum cx given secretions.  On
   reasonable rx at present for VAP, though if spikes could add addl GNR
   coverage or d/w ID.
   Acute renal failure
   Check bladder pressure
   Urine output clearing improving, and creatinine plateaued.  Probably
   entering post-ATN diuretic phase
   [image004.jpg]
   MRSA bacteremia
   Since line placed while he had high-grade bacteremia with Staph, will
   resite.
   TEE in next few days
   Communication and HCP
   [**Name (NI) **] is not able to participate in decisions, and we have no
   identified proxy at this point.  Will attempt to ask his PCP if anyone
   has been identified in past, and will consult social work for help.  In
   the meantime, I believe that the interventions above (antibiotics,
   mechanical ventilation, and resiting line) have benefits that far
   outweigh risks at the present time and
 in the absence of known
   patient wishes
 we will proceed with this medically indicated care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man admitted with cholangitis, who has now developed respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and MRSA bacteremia. He is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of his respiratory, renal, and infectious complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of the bed, performing regular mouth care, and implementing daily spontaneous breathing trials to assess readiness for extubation.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for DVT and PE due to immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures, such as the use of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and compression stockings, should be implemented.

3. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk for acquiring additional nosocomial infections due to invasive lines and procedures. Regular monitoring of line insertions, cultures, and adherence to infection control practices are crucial.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly is important. Measures to improve renal function, such as maintaining adequate oxygenation and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs"

   past in this patient.  Gave 3L LR yesterday to maintain BP and urine
   output and have weaned pressors.  Likely he was hypotensive from sepsis
   from known infection from cholangitis. Patient is s/p ERCP w/
   sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and purulent material.
   -- d/c Zosyn
   -- d/c Vancomycin and start Nafcillin 2g q4h as per ID recs
   -- fluid boluses as needed, urine output has been improving
   -- TEE today to r/o endocarditis as blood cx are growing MSSA
   -- f/u surveillance BCx daily
   2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- Respiratory distress due to body habitus- has
   short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound
   of his pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional
   breaths. Other considerations could include pneumonia, atelectasis
   ARDS, volume overload states; however, primary pulmonary process is
   less likely given known cholangitis/ bacteremia.
   -- keep intubated on current settings, did not tolerate PS (became
   apneic)
   -- will change RR as PaCO2 probably higher at baseline
   -- serial ABGs
   -- keep sedation on current settings, have been increased slightly this
   am due to patient discomfort
   --f/u mini-bal cx
   3. OLIGURIA- Urine output has picked up, likely was a combination of
   ATN and prerenal etiologies.
   -- appreciate renal recs
   -- Will hold off on further IVF for now, and bolus for low urine output
   -- will trend BUN/Cr
   -- will give 150mEq NaHCO3

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. Currently, he is intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient was previously hypotensive but has since been stabilized with fluid boluses and weaned off pressors. However, there is a possibility of recurrent hypotension due to ongoing sepsis from the known infection related to cholangitis. Appropriate antibiotics have been initiated, and further monitoring is needed.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is primarily due to his body habitus, causing a short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration. This can lead to inadequate ventilation and the need for mechanical ventilation. Other possible causes include pneumonia, atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or volume overload states. The patient will remain intubated on current settings, with adjustments made as necessary.
3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has improved, suggesting a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and prerenal etiologies. Renal recommendations will be followed, and further intravenous fluids will be administered judiciously."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy, currently
   intubated and sedated.
   1. HYPOTENSION/ SEPSIS- Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all
   pressors.  Likely he was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection
   from cholangitis. Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction
   of gallstones and purulent material.
   -- continue Nafcillin 2g q4h as per ID recs (day 2)
   -- fluid boluses as needed, urine output has been improving
   -- f/u final TEE report
   -- f/u all outstanding cultures
   --daily surveillance cultures
   2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- Respiratory distress due to body habitus- has
   short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound
   of his pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional
   breaths.  Moreover, there was likely constrbution from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Renal function may be a barrier
   to extubation as well due to volume status.
   -- Discontinue sedation and SBT / RSBI with current PEEP settings given
   body habitus
   --Diuresis goal of -1-2 liters today
   --Monitor renal function, urine output.
   3. [**Last Name (un) **]  - Urine output has picked up, likely was a combination of ATN
   and prerenal etiologies.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent ERCP with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient is currently intubated and sedated.
- The patient had hypotension, which was likely due to sepsis from an infection related to cholangitis. He was treated with nafcillin, fluid boluses, and pressors. The patient's hypotension has now resolved.
- The patient experienced respiratory distress, which was attributed to his body habitus. He also had a short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound of his pannus. There was also likely contribution from cholangitis/bacteremia, which is improving.
- The plan includes discontinuing sedation and performing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) / respiratory system assessment with current PEEP settings given the patient's body habitus.
- The diuresis goal is -1 to 2 liters today, and renal function should be monitored along with urine output.
- The patient's urine output has picked up, likely due to a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and prerenal etiologies. Renal recommendations should be continued, and further intravenous fluids (IVF) will be held off for now. BUN/Cr trends will be monitored.
- The patient has cholangitis, and ERCP was performed following the recommendation to repeat it in 6 weeks.
- The ICU care includes tube feeds, glycemic control with RISS, multi-lumen lines, arterial line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy, currently
   intubated and sedated.
   1. HYPOTENSION/ SEPSIS- Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all
   pressors.  CVP
s have been 17-26, although have been unreliable in the
   past in this patient.  Gave 3L LR yesterday to maintain BP and urine
   output and have weaned pressors.  Likely he was hypotensive from sepsis
   from known infection from cholangitis. Patient is s/p ERCP w/
   sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and purulent material.
   -- d/c Zosyn
   -- d/c Vancomycin and start Nafcillin 2g q4h as per ID recs
   -- fluid boluses as needed, urine output has been improving
   -- TEE today to r/o endocarditis as blood cx are growing MSSA
   -- f/u surveillance BCx daily
   2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- Respiratory distress due to body habitus- has
   short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound
   of his pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional
   breaths. Other considerations could include pneumonia, atelectasis
   ARDS, volume overload states; however, primary pulmonary process is
   less likely given known cholangitis/ bacteremia.
   -- keep intubated on current settings, did not tolerate PS (became
   apneic)
   -- will change RR as PaCO2 probably higher at baseline
   -- serial ABGs
   -- keep sedation on current settings, have been increased slightly this
   am due to patient discomfort
   --f/u mini-bal cx
   3. OLIGURIA- Urine output has picked up, likely was a combination of
   ATN and prerenal etiologies.
   -- appreciate renal recs
   -- Will hold off on further IVF for now, and bolus for low urine output
   -- will trend BUN/Cr
   -- will give 150mEq NaHCO3
   4. CHOLANGITIS
 ERCP following, recommended repeat in 6 weeks.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient is currently intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he has been weaned off all vasopressors. However, there may be ongoing sepsis from a known infection related to cholangitis. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) has been fluctuating between 17-26, indicating potential fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and urine output is recommended.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to his morbid obesity, causing a short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration. This could result in inadequate ventilation and increased work of breathing. Other considerations include pneumonia, atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or volume overload states. Current ventilator settings should be maintained, and serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) should be monitored.
3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has improved, possibly due to a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and prerenal etiologies."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of obesity now admitted with biliary
   sepsis--with MSSA on cultures.  Renal failure likely attributable to
   ATN based upon renal evaluation.  What is at issue is that patient
   maintains significant volume overload, severe hypoxemia with elevated
   PEEP requirements noted.  This is related primarily to patient baseline
   body habitus but additional fluid load is likely contributor in
   idfficulty with wean of FIO2 support.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Acute and Chronic-He has persistent and
   significant hypoxemia
with high PEEP requirements.  This is with
   PEEP=16. This is with sepsis improved on current treatment now with
   organism identified and treatment in place.  Patient has excellent
   response to verbal questions and appropriate responses.  We have modest
   volume overload and do have persistent elevated creatinine.
   -Will maintain in PSV support for now with PEEP
   -Will check RSBI for evaluation at this time
   -Will not go to SBT as we have concerns persisting in regards to volume
   status
   2)Sepsis--Likely biliary source-With MSSA seen on culture results and
   clear evidence of improvement
   -Nafcillin to continue
   -TEE completed.
   -Follow with surgery and ERCP rec
   3)Renal Failure-Mild improvement in urine flow but with persistent
   creatinine elevation
   -Follow urine output
   -Hold on pharmacologic diruesis for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of obesity admitted to the ICU with biliary sepsis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He has renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and persistent respiratory failure with significant hypoxemia requiring high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient also has volume overload and an elevated creatinine level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent and significant hypoxemia, along with the need for high PEEP requirements, indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially necessitating mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently responding well to treatment for biliary sepsis with MSSA, there is still a risk of recurrence or progression of infection. Close monitoring for signs of worsening sepsis is essential.
3. Renal Failure: The persistent elevation in creatinine indicates ongoing renal dysfunction. It is crucial to closely monitor urine output and adjust fluid and medication management accordingly to prevent further deterioration in kidney function.
4. Volume Overload: The patient's significant volume overload increases the risk of complications such as pulmonary edema, worsening heart failure, and increased pressure in the intracranial region. Managing fluid balance and diuresis carefully will"

   intubated and sedated.
   1. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- Respiratory distress due to body habitus- has
   short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound
   of his pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional
   breaths.  Moreover, there was likely constribution from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Renal function may be a barrier
   to extubation as well due to volume status.
   -- Discontinue sedation and SBT / RSBI with current PEEP settings given
   body habitus
   -- Diuresis goal of -1-2 liters today
   -- Monitor renal function, urine output.
   2. HYPOTENSION/ SEPSIS- Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all
   pressors.  Likely he was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection
   from cholangitis. Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of common bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. Currently, he is intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's body habitus may contribute to respiratory distress due to a short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration. Additionally, there may be a contribution from cholangitis/bacteremia, which is now improving. Renal function may also be a barrier to extubation.

Plan:
- Discontinue sedation and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) / respiratory system assessment with current positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings given the patient's body habitus.
- Diuresis goal of -1-2 liters today.
- Monitor renal function and urine output.

2. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he has been weaned off all vasopressors. It is likely that the hypotension was due to sepsis from the known infection related to cholangitis. The patient has undergone ERCP with sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and purulent material.

Plan:
- Continue nafc"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's body habitus is causing respiratory distress due to a short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration. This could lead to further complications if not managed properly. The plan includes continuing pressure support, discontinuing sedation, and weaning PEEP as tolerated.

2. Hypotension/sepsis: The patient had hypotension, which is now resolved, likely from sepsis related to the known infection from cholangitis. The plan includes continuing nafcillin per ID recommendations, fluid boluses as needed, and following up with final transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE) report.

3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's urine output has improved, but it is likely that there was a combination of ATN and prerenal etiologies. The plan includes trending BUN/Cr, checking urine osmolality, and appreciating continued renal recommendations.

4. Cholangitis: The patient had"

   the setting of modest volume overload now moving to negative fluild
   balance each day.  He has had encouraging trend of decrease in
   creatinine across time in the setting of increased diuresis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with good tolerance of PSV this morning
   but requiring PEEP at elevated levels to maintain airspace patency.
   This seems only mildly changed with patient up in chair today.  He
   retains significant barriers of chest wall restriction which will
   remain largely fixed but also with significant volume overload and
   patient moving to post ATN diuresis.
   -Will maintain as negative as possible in regards to volume status
   -Will maintain with PEEP elevation at 16-20

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with cholangitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure with stone removal, which improved sepsis but left the patient with significant respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of obesity and is experiencing volume overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
   - Barotrauma or bronchial rupture due to high pressures used during mechanical ventilation
   - Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) due to high tidal volumes or plateau pressures
   - Tracheal stenosis or damage from prolonged intubation

2. Infection-related Complications:
   - Sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infection despite antibiotic therapy
   - Multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infection due to antibiotic overuse or misuse
   - Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI)

3. Renal Complications:
   - Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs, or hypotension
   - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) if the patient has pre-existing kidney dysfunction

4. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Cardiogenic shock or heart failure due to sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy and subsequent
   sepsis, currently intubated and sedated.
   #. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- Respiratory distress due to body habitus- has
   short inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound
   of his pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional
   breaths.  Moreover, there was likely constribution from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Renal function improving and
   likely will be less of a barrier to extubation due to volume status.
   -- Continue on pressure support, discontinue sedation and wean PEEP as
   tolerated
   -- Diuresis goal of -1-2 liters daily, goal achieved yesterday
   -- Monitor renal function, urine output
   #. SEPSIS- Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all pressors.  Likely
   he was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection from cholangitis.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.
   -- continue Nafcillin 2g q4h as per ID recs (day 5, last day [**2115-12-24**])
   -- fluid boluses as needed, urine output has been improving
   -- f/u final TEE report: prelim shows no valvular vegetation, masses or
   abscess.
   -- f/u all outstanding cultures
   --daily surveillance cultures
   3. [**Last Name (un) **]  - Urine output has picked up, likely was a combination of ATN
   and prerenal etiologies.
   -- appreciate continued renal recs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. Post-procedure, he developed sepsis, which is now improving.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. His respiratory distress is attributed to his body habitus and the prolonged expiration phase, which could lead to ventilator-associated complications. His renal function is improving, and he has achieved the goal of diuresis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory distress, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and obesity are risk factors for DVT.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient's current sepsis appears to be improving, there is still a risk of recurrent sepsis due to the underlying infection from cholangitis.
4. Cholangitis: The patient has a history of cholangitis, and there is a recommendation for repeat ERCP in six weeks for stent pull.
5. Renal complications:"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy and subsequent
   sepsis, currently intubated and sedated.
   #. Respiratory failure with b/l pleural effusions on CXR.  Pt has short
   inspiratory phase and prolonged expiration with massive rebound of his
   pannus which could cause ventilator to deliver additional breaths.
   Moreover, resp failure was likely redistribution of fluid from
   cholangitis/ bacteremia, which is now improving.   Renal function
   improving and likely will be less of a barrier to extubation due to
   volume status.
   -- Continue on pressure support, wean sedation and wean PEEP as
   tolerated
   -- Diuresis goal of -1-2 liters daily, goal achieved yesterday
   -- Monitor renal function, urine output
    -If  PEEP at 10  or less and PS at 5, will move to extubation
   - consider changing sedation to versed/fentanyl if looks like patient
   will not extubate within 24 hours
   - check triglycerides
   .
   # SEPSIS: Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all pressors.  Likely he
   was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection from cholangitis.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.
   -- continue Nafcillin 2g q4h as per ID recs (day 5, last day [**2115-12-24**])
   -- fluid boluses as needed, urine output has been improving
   -- f/u final TEE report: prelim shows no valvular vegetation, masses or
   abscess.
   -- f/u all outstanding cultures
   --Catheter tip with coag negative staph  concerning, but most likely
   contaminant giving patient
s clinical status. Will discuss with ID
   whether need to broaded coverage.

   #. Hypertension:
   - start hydralazine 10 q6h, consider adding beta blocker if continues
   to be hypertensive
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]  - Urine output has picked up, likely was a combination of ATN
   and prerenal etiologies.
   -- appreciate renal recs
   -- will trend BUN/Cr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and subsequently underwent ERCP with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. Following the procedure, the patient developed sepsis and was intubated and sedated.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusions, renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hypertension, and cholangitis. The patient's renal function is improving, and his urine output is increasing.

The assessment and plan include continuing pressure support, weaning sedation, and weaning PEEP as tolerated. The diuresis goal of -1 to 2 liters daily has been achieved, and the patient's renal function and urine output should be monitored. If PEEP is at 10 or less and PS (positive end-expiratory pressure) is at 5, the patient may be considered for extubation. However, if the patient does not tolerate extubation within 24 hours, sedation can be changed to versed/fentanyl.

Regarding sepsis, the patient's hypotension has resolved, and he has been weaned off all pressors. The patient underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and purulent material. Nafcillin 2g q"

   Imaging: CXR-Bilateral pleural effusions
   Microbiology: Catheter Tip--+ for MRSA
   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with obesity and now admitted wtih cholangitis and now with
   persistent respiratory failure.  We have substantial improvement in all
   parameters that were abnormal as a result of acute infectious insult
   with sepsis resolved, acute renal failure showing substantial
   improvement but we are left with signficant chest wall restriction with
   significant obesity.  We will need to evolve a path to wean of
   ventilator support.
   1)Respiratory Failure-patient with concerning findings of bilateral
   pleural effusions.  He has quite a reasonable capacity to tolerate
   minimal PSV support with PS=5 this morning which is favorable.  What is
   a limiting factor is the risk of significant hypoxemia and collapse
   following removal of positive intrapleural pressures.
   -Will keep PEEP at 12-16 cm H2O
   -Would like to move to negative fluid balance across today
   -Will keep sedation reasonable
   -PSV decreased to 5 and would like to maintain adequte ventilation to
   keep PCO2 45-50
   -Will move to Versed/Fentanyl
   -Will check triglycerides
   -Will move to blood pressure control at this time in advance of
   extubation and will return to beta blocker for BP control as well as
   afterload reduction
   -If we can move to PSV of 5, PEEP at 10 or less will move to
   extubation.
   -Of note
patient has had excellent mental status on exam today with
   current levels of sedation
   2)Sepsis--Secondary to cholangitis and with subsequent gram positive
   bacteremia with MSSA seen on blood cultures
   -Nafcillin in place
   -Catheter tip with coag negative staph is of concern but do not see
   evidence of systemic insult from a resistant pathogen
without further
   confirmation that organism is active pathogen will continue with
   current Rx.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with obesity admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and persistent respiratory failure. The patient has shown substantial improvement in parameters related to sepsis and acute renal failure. However, the patient still faces significant chest wall restriction due to obesity. The plan is to evolve a path for ventilator weaning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions and a history of respiratory failure. The limiting factor for weaning off ventilator support is the risk of significant hypoxemia and collapse following removal of positive intrapleural pressures. The plan includes keeping PEEP at 12-16 cm H2O, maintaining adequate ventilation, moving to a negative fluid balance, decreasing sedation, and monitoring triglyceride levels.

2. Sepsis: The patient had secondary sepsis due to cholangitis and gram-positive bacteremia with MSSA seen on blood cultures. The current antibiotic treatment includes Nafcillin. The concern is the catheter tip with coag-negative staph, but there is no evidence of systemic insult from a resistant pathogen. Further confirmation is needed before changing the antibiotic regimen.

Other considerations:
- The patient requires nutritional support.
- Glycemic control should be maintained.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention and stress ulcer protection.
- VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia) precautions should be taken.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient subsequently developed sepsis and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusions as seen on the chest X-ray. This may be due to fluid redistribution from cholangitis/bacteremia. However, the respiratory function is improving, and the patient may be weaned off ventilatory support soon.
2. Renal Dysfunction: The patient had renal dysfunction initially, but it is now improving. Monitoring renal function and urine output is essential, and diuresis goals are being achieved.
3. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis likely caused by an infection from cholangitis. Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, and all pressors have been weaned off, ongoing monitoring is required. Nafcillin therapy has been initiated as per ID recommendations.
4. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive, and hydralazine has been started. If the hypertension persists, a beta-blocker may be added.
5. Cholangitis: The patient had cholangitis, and ERCP was performed. Repeat ERCP in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old obese male with an unknown chief complaint. He has been in the ICU since 12/12/15 and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show hypertension and tachycardia. His ABG results from 12/26 show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 44, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 150, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient has elevated triglycerides but is still receiving propofol for sedation. He has been given Lasix to manage fluid balance, and his renal and surgical teams have signed off. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's medical history includes nafcillin use on 12/17/15 at 4:01 AM. He is currently receiving propofol, famotidine, and heparin sodium as ICU medications. Other medications include hydralazine. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for pain. His flow sheet data shows a temperature of 37.9 C, blood pressure ranging from 136/82 to 198/123 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 77 to 89 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 11 to 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is 163.8 kg, and his height is 57 inches. His fluid balance shows an intake of 1,965 mL and output of 3,545 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,580 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with admission with cholangitis and sepsis complicated by
   respiratory failure and renal failure now improved.  He retains a very
   difficult issue in regards to oxygenation and effective ventilation in
   the setting of substantial obesity.  He has quite good improvement in
   renal function and has been able to maintain negative fluid balance
   over the past days.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient has initial intubation in the setting of
   sepsis secondary to biliary source.  This was complicated by
   significant renal failure.  Now patient has good evidence that sepsis
   has resolved.  In addition, patient has had substantial improvement in
   urine flow.  He retains a good mental status with wake up from sedation
   wean and has adequate cuff leak present.  He has been able to maintain
   adequate ventilation with PSV in place but with significant elevation
   in respiratory rate.
   Given substantial improvement in initial insult and improved mental
   status noted this may be favorable time to consider extubation with
   some real risk.
   -Will contact anesthesia to consider approach for optimization of
   safety around extubation attempt.
   -Will have patient up to chair as possible aid in optimization in
   pulmonary mechanics
   -Will use Nitroprusside peri-extubation
   -Will add to Amlodipine/Hydral at this time
   2)HTN-
   Hydral/Amlodipine in place
   -Will move to nipride for control at this time
   Will need long term Rx
   3)Sepsis-
   -Continue ABX
   -Will need to consider culture results in future treatment
   4)Renal Failure-
   -Improved renal failure
   -Creatinine is stabilized at 1.2 and will maintain fluid balance as
   even today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He was admitted with cholangitis and sepsis, which has since improved. The patient is currently experiencing difficulties with oxygenation and ventilation due to substantial obesity. He has shown improvement in renal function and has maintained a negative fluid balance over the past few days.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to sepsis secondary to a biliary source. This was complicated by significant renal failure. Now, the patient has good evidence that sepsis has resolved, and there has been substantial improvement in urine flow. He retains a good mental status, with wakefulness from sedation wean and adequate cuff leak present. He has been able to maintain adequate ventilation with Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) in place but with a significant elevation in respiratory rate.

Considering the substantial improvement in the initial insult and improved mental status, it may be a favorable time to consider extubation with some real risk. The plan includes contacting anesthesia to consider the approach for optimization of safety around extubation attempt, having the patient up to a chair as possible to aid in optimization of pulmonary mechanics, and using Nitroprusside peri-extubation. The patient will also be added to Amlodipine/Hydralazine at this time.

   BC x2
   1 set from aline
   1 set from cvl
   - Plan to extubate today with anesthesia present, add labetalol after
   extubation however desated with movement
   - got 20mg IV lasix for diuresis at 2pm, net neg 1.5 L for day
   - pt. using Presodex at approx $800/hr
   - changed TFs
   - recheck of TGs was 500s.  discussed restarting propofol with pharmacy
   and they stated as long as temporary and level <1000 thought it was OK.
   - put on peep of 15 overnight and plan to retry plan of extubation in
   am.  resp therapy stated to consider decreasing to 12 of peep first.
   this was done, ABG:
   - with nitroprusside gtt and labetolol 200mg PO, dropped pressure to 80
   then 60s, so stopped drip, started bolusing with IV labetolol, received
   140mg over approx 2 hours without change.  Got 10mg IV Hydral and
   decreased approx 15 SBP. Real BP change came with change in sedation.
   - was given 25 mcg of fentanyl approx 2345 for looking uncomfortable
   with cough and possible pain.
   -approximately 1am, P02 was only approx 100 on 50% fi02, so felt would
   not make extubation tomorrow so d/c'd presodex and started midaz
   boluses with fentanyl.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent ERCP with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient subsequently developed sepsis, which led to respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, and pain control issues. He is currently intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. Redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/bacteremia may have contributed to this condition, which is now improving. There is a plan to attempt extubation today with anesthesia involvement for safety.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has been improving, making it less likely to be a barrier to extubation. However, there is ongoing monitoring of urine output and fluid balance.

3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with nitroprusside peri-extubation, along with continued hydralazine, amlodipine, and labetalol orally.

4. Sepsis: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved and pressors have been weaned off, he still requires ongoing monitoring for any signs of sepsis. Nafcillin has been continued as per ID recommendations."

   sepsis, currently intubated and sedated.
   #. Respiratory failure with b/l pleural effusions on CXR.   Moreover,
   resp failure was likely redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Renal function improving and
   likely will be less of a barrier to extubation due to volume status.
   Patient has been tolerating PS 5 and PEEP of 12 this morning with good
   mental status when sedation is weaned.
   -Will attempt extubation today, with anesthesia involved to optimize
   safety
   -Will have patient up to chair to aid in pulmonary mechanics

   risk of flash pulmonary edema
   -continue fentanyl/midaz for sedation peri-extubation

   # Hypertension:
   -nitroprusside peri-extubation
   -continue hydral, amplodipine and labetolol PO

   # SEPSIS: Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all pressors.  Likely he
   was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection from cholangitis.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.  Per ID, catheter tip with coag negative staph is
   likely contaminant and no need to broaden coverage.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and subsequently underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient developed sepsis following the ERCP procedure and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need attention. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is likely due to fluid redistribution from cholangitis/bacteremia. However, his respiratory function is improving, and he has been tolerating positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O and a tidal volume (Vt) of 319 mL.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. His renal function is improving, and he is expected to have better urine output. Renal dosed medications should be redosed accordingly.

3. Sepsis: The patient initially had sepsis with hypotension, but his blood pressure has been stabilized, and all pressors have been weaned off. The source of infection is identified as cholangitis, and appropriate antibiotic coverage with nafc"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy and subsequent
   sepsis, currently intubated and sedated.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure with b/l pleural effusions on CXR.   Moreover,
   resp failure was likely redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Extubated yesterday with good
   post-extubation ABG.  Tolerating face tent with good oxygenation, but
   continues to be tachypneic and intermittently complains of dyspnea.
   CXR shows persistent fluid overload and possible left base
   consolidation.
   -continue to monitor I/O
   -daily lasix prn to maintain goal of 1-2L neg
   -consider Bipap at night (uses CPAP at home)
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Most likely delirium, and felt to be related
   to prolonged sedation while intubated.  Unlikely to be metabolic
   process given normal electrolytes.   Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypertension: Pt cleared for POs and will transition to partial home
   regimen.
   - PO amlodipine, labetolol and lisinopril for now
   - can add home [**Last Name (un) **] if continues to be hypertensive
   .
   # SEPSIS: Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all pressors.  Likely he
   was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection from cholangitis.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.  Per ID, catheter tip with coag negative staph is
   likely contaminant and no need to broaden coverage.  New Cx from [**12-15**]
   pos for GPRs is likely a contaminant.  Will remove arterial line and
   monitor for further fevers.
   -- continue Nafcillin 2g q4h as per ID recs (day 6, last day [**2115-12-24**])
   -- f/u all outstanding cultures
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **] - Urine output now improved, likely was a combination of ATN and
   prerenal etiologies.
   -- will continue to trend BUN/Cr

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient required invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and doing well post-ABG. The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled but later became hypertensive, requiring multiple doses of hydralazine and labetalol. The patient also received morphine for pain management. Laboratory results show an elevated potassium level, which was repleted, and a C. diff test was ordered. The patient's sodium level increased, resulting in the administration of D5W. The patient's intake and output were closely monitored, with an I/O of -1.4L since 12 am. The patient experienced difficulty finding words and confusion last night, possibly due to delirium. An ABG showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 48, PaO2 99, and HCO3- 30. The patient was given zydis 5mg x 2 and later received 1mg IV ativan, which may have worsened the confusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with an unclear baseline English ability. He has been in the ICU since 12/12/15 and has had several significant events. The patient was previously intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but the tube was successfully removed at 09:21 AM on 12/18. His blood pressure has been difficult to control, requiring multiple doses of hydralazine and labetalol. The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and he has been given D5W to help correct this. He also has ongoing fluid loss through urine and drains, with a total loss of 1.4L since midnight. 

The patient experienced some confusion and difficulty finding words last night, which may be indicative of delirium. His ABG showed a pH of 7.44, suggesting respiratory alkalosis. The patient has been given zydis 5mg x 2 and 1mg IV ativan, which may have worsened his confusion. His blood sugars have not been low. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 177/68 to 200's, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His maximum temperature was 38C. 

The patient's recent labs show a potassium level of 3.5, which has been repleted. He has been ordered for C. diff testing. His WBC count is low at 7.1, and his Hct is 29.5%. 

Radiology images from 12/17 and 12/18 are noted, but no specific findings are mentioned in the progress note. 

Assessment and Plan:
- ICU care, including NPO status pending speech and swallow evaluation
- Glycemic control
- Lines: multi-lumen and arterial line in place
- Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient subsequently developed sepsis and was intubated and sedated.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure, which was likely due to the redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/bacteremia. However, there is improvement in respiratory function.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, most likely delirium. This could be attributed to the long hospital course and recent sedation.

3. Hypertension: The patient had episodes of hypertension, with blood pressure readings in the 180s-200s. Medications such as hydralazine, labetalol, and nifedipine were used to control blood pressure.

4. Sepsis: The patient was diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to an infection from cholangitis. Antibiotic therapy with nafcillin was initiated, and the patient has since been weaned off all vasopressors.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient had reduced urine output, indicating possible acute tubular nec"

   65 yo male with obsity and admit with cholangitis and sepsis now
   extubated with success.  He did have some alteration in mental status
   across the night but has returned to good alertness this morning but
   has limited orientation representing a dynamic exam of enceophalopathy
   across time.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This remains the primary threat to patient
   progress
   -extubated without event
   -He retains tachypnea and significant O2 requirement related to
   bilateral consolidations and effusions
   -Will trial nasal BIPAP going forward for support
   -Ideally patient will do incentive spirometry at some point but not
   able to right now
   -Chest PT may aid in treatment for secretion clearance
   -Continue negative fluid balance
   2)Hypertension-
   -Amlodipine 10mg
   -Hydral 40mg q 4 hours
   3)Altered Mental Status
This is delirium
likely multifactorial
   -Will minimize sedating medications
   -Follow exam, which at this point does not suggest focal CNS deficit
   4)Acute renal failure-
   -continued creatinine improvement in the setting of negative fluid
   balance
   -Continue negative fluild balance
   5)Cholangitis--AP mild elevated, other enzymes improved
   -Willl need follow up evaluation for removal of gallbladder
   -Will complete nafcillin

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with obesity admitted to the ICU for cholangitis and sepsis. He has been successfully extubated but continues to have respiratory failure, requiring significant oxygen support due to bilateral consolidations and effusions. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but will be tried on nasal BIPAP going forward. He is also unable to perform incentive spirometry at this time. The patient's hypertension is being managed with amlodipine and hydralazine. His altered mental status is likely multifactorial and will be treated by minimizing sedating medications. The patient is experiencing acute renal failure but has shown improvement in creatinine levels in the setting of negative fluid balance. Cholangitis is still present, with mildly elevated AP levels, and will require follow-up evaluation for gallbladder removal. The patient will complete nafcillin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is the primary threat to his progress. Despite being extubated without event, he retains tachypnea and significant O2 requirement due to bilateral consolidations and effusions. Nasal BIPAP will be trialed for support, and the patient will not be able to perform incentive spirometry at this time. Chest PT may aid in treatment for secretion clearance, and continuing negative fluid balance is important.

2. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with amlodipine"

The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient subsequently developed sepsis and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

24-hour events include:
- Arterial line stopped on [**2115-12-19**] at 12:00 PM.
- Diet was changed to passed speech and swallow.
- Blood pressure control was achieved with amlodipine/lisinopril/labetolol PO, but the patient's systolic blood pressure went up to 180, so 20 IV hydralazine was given with good effect.
- PICC was ordered but not received.
- Lasix 20 IV was given in the PM.
- Bipap was used overnight.
- The patient had a fever of 101 degrees at 1800, and a blood culture was sent with tylenol administered.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including impaired skin integrity, fever, hypertension, acute renal failure, pain control, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acidosis, cholangitis, and delirium.

Assessment and plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity - ongoing assessment and care.
2. Fever - monitoring for further fevers and"

   .
   #. Respiratory failure with b/l pleural effusions on CXR.   Moreover,
   resp failure was likely redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Extubated yesterday with good
   post-extubation ABG.  Tolerating face tent with good oxygenation, but
   continues to be tachypneic and intermittently complains of dyspnea.
   CXR shows persistent fluid overload and possible left base
   consolidation.
   -continue to monitor I/O
   -daily lasix prn to maintain goal of 1-2L neg
   -consider Bipap at night (uses CPAP at home)
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Most likely delirium, and felt to be related
   to prolonged sedation while intubated.  Unlikely to be metabolic
   process given normal electrolytes.   Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypertension: Pt cleared for POs and will transition to partial home
   regimen.
   - PO amlodipine, labetolol and lisinopril for now
   - can add home [**Last Name (un) **] if continues to be hypertensive
   .
   # SEPSIS: Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all pressors.  Likely he
   was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection from cholangitis.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.  Per ID, catheter tip with coag negative staph is
   likely contaminant and no need to broaden coverage.  New Cx from [**12-15**]
   pos for GPRs is likely a contaminant.  Will remove arterial line and
   monitor for further fevers.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of common bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient subsequently developed sepsis and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. This was likely due to fluid redistribution from cholangitis/bacteremia. Although the patient was extubated yesterday, he continues to be tachypneic and intermittently complains of dyspnea. The chest X-ray shows persistent fluid overload and possible left base consolidation.

2. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that has been managed with intravenous hydralazine and oral medications (amlodipine/lisinopril/labetolol). The plan is to transition the patient to a partial home regimen.

3. Sepsis: The patient had hypotension secondary to sepsis from the known infection related to cholangitis. After undergoing ERCP with sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones, the patient's hypotension resolved, and all pressors were weaned off"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis.
- He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent ERCP with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy.
- He subsequently developed sepsis and was intubated and sedated.
- The patient has been extubated and is tolerating face tent with good oxygenation but continues to be tachypneic and intermittently complains of dyspnea.
- His chest X-ray shows persistent fluid overload and possible left base consolidation.
- He has a Corynebacterium bacteremia, which spiked through Nafcillin, so additional coverage with Vancomycin may be needed.
- The patient is likely experiencing delirium related to prolonged sedation while intubated.
- He has hypertension that has been managed with oral medications.
- The patient's sepsis is thought to be related to his known infection from cholangitis.
- His renal function is impaired, and he has acute respiratory failure.
- He also has cholangitis, for which repeat ERCP is recommended in six weeks to pull the stent.
- The patient's nutritional needs are being managed by speech and swallow therapy, allowing for ground solids and nectar-thick liquids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted with obstructing biliary stone and sepsis, which has now improved substantially. He was extubated without event two days ago and has returned to oral intake. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, hypertension, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is still experiencing persistent fevers despite improvement in sepsis. There is a need for change of central line and consultation with Infectious Disease due to the presence of Corynebacterium seen on blood cultures.

2. Hypertension: The patient is being treated with hydralazine for hypertension. Medication titration will continue going forward.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG findings are reassuring, indicating that he maintains adequate ventilation. However, the patient may still require nighttime high-flow oxygen and continued diuresis. Weaning of oxygen as tolerated should also be considered.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient likely continues to experience delirium. ICU care should include continued monitoring and management of his altered mental status.

Please note that the patient's condition is currently stable, but there are ongoing concerns regarding sepsis and the need for further investigation and treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. Post-procedure, he developed sepsis and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusions, altered mental status, renal failure, pain control, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acidosis, cholangitis, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to fluid redistribution from cholangitis/bacteremia. It is improving with the use of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) at night. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, likely caused by prolonged sedation while intubated. It is important to reassess the mental status daily.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and prerenal etiologies. Monitoring of the patient's renal function is essential.
4. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis, which has now resolved."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis. He underwent ERCP with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy, which led to sepsis. Currently, he is intubated and sedated. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acidosis, cholangitis, renal failure, sepsis, hypertension, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The presence of bilateral pleural effusions on the chest X-ray suggests fluid accumulation in the lungs, which may contribute to respiratory failure. Monitoring I/O (inputs and outputs) and continuing bipap at night are recommended.
2. Acidosis: The patient has respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation. Close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG) and continuing bipap at night are necessary.
3. Cholangitis: The patient was admitted for cholangitis and underwent ERCP with stent placement. A repeat ERCP in 6 weeks is recommended for stent pull.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and trend BUN/Cr levels are advised.
5. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis following the ERCP"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and subsequently developed sepsis. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray.
2. Impaired skin integrity.
3. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin).
4. Hypertension, benign.
5. Renal failure, acute (acute kidney injury, AKI).
6. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain).
7. Sepsis without organ dysfunction.
8. Respiratory failure, acute (not acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS).
9. Acidosis, respiratory.
10. Cholangitis.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and there is a need for close monitoring of his vital signs, fluid intake/output, and laboratory values. The patient is also being treated for Corynebacterium bacteremia with vancomycin and nafcillin. His atrial fibrillation should be further evaluated, and anticoagulation may be necessary. The patient's altered mental status is being assessed, and daily reass"

   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy and subsequent
   sepsis.  Intubated due to volume overload and body habitus and
   extubated [**12-18**].  Now with altered mental status, corynebacteria
   bacteremia, new A fib with RVR.
   # Altered Mental Status: Most likely delirium, and felt to be related
   to prolonged sedation while intubated.  Unlikely to be metabolic
   process given normal electrolytes and improvement during course of day
   yesterday and today
   -just too heavy for CT scanner plus cannot be flat
   -reassess MS and need daily, no need for head CT now
   -receiving prn haldol for agitation with good effect
   .
   #  corneybacterium and MSSA bacteremia:  now on Vanc, day 1: [**12-20**] pm
   for indeterminate course and nafcillin with planned course through
   [**12-24**].
   -Vanc trough this AM slightly high 21.4 , decreased dose to 1000 q12h
   -f/u ID recs
   -CVL replaced [**12-20**]
   .
   #  afib: per chart, possible [**Last Name **] problem.  Converted to Sinus yesterday
   after receiving IV and PO metoprolol.
   -continue heparin gtt and coumadin until therapeutic INR (pending this
   AM)
   .
   #. Respiratory failure with b/l pleural effusions on CXR.   Moreover,
   resp failure was likely redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Tolerating bipap at night
   -ABG [**12-20**] reassuring
    -continue to monitor I/O
   - no lasix for now given low BPs
   -continue bipap at night
   -tolerated being flat off oxygen yesterday so continue to wean as
   tolerated
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt cleared for POs and better controlled on PO meds as
   of [**12-20**].
   - PO amlodipine, hydral and lisinopril for now
   - on labetolol drip
   - can add home [**Last Name (un) **] if continues to be hypertensive
 renal fcn improved
   .
   # SEPSIS: Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all pressors.  Likely he
   was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection from cholangitis.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.  Per ID, catheter tip with coag negative staph is
   likely contaminant and no need to broaden coverage.

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and subsequently developed sepsis. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is somnolent and oriented only to person, not responding appropriately to questions. This could be due to prolonged sedation while intubated, and it is unlikely to be a metabolic process given normal electrolytes and improvement during the course of the day yesterday and today.

2. Corynebacterium and Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (MSSA) Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by corynebacteria and MSSA. He is currently being treated with vancomycin (Vanc), and nafcillin is planned through December 24th. The vancomycin trough is slightly high at 21.4, so the dose has been decreased to 1000 q12h.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib, which was converted to sinus rhythm yesterday after receiving intravenous and oral metoprolol. He will continue on heparin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent ERCP with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. Subsequently, he developed sepsis.
- The patient was intubated due to volume overload and body habitus and was extubated on [**12-18**]. Currently, he presents with altered mental status, Corynebacterium bacteremia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).
- The patient's hypertension is now better controlled on oral medications.
- He has shown improvement in respiratory failure, which was likely due to redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/bacteremia.
- The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.2, likely due to the initiation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI).
- His condition has been complicated by hypotension, which has resolved, and he no longer requires pressors.
- The patient has an upcoming follow-up for ERCP in six weeks for stent pull.
- His nutritional status is being managed with ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
- The patient's code status is full code.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to multi-lumen line placement. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was given intravenous beta blocker followed by oral metoprolol to convert to sinus rhythm. The patient's blood pressure has been high, with readings in the 210s, and has been controlled with IV hydralazine, then oral hydralazine, and finally a labetalol drip.

The patient received 2mg IV x2 of Haldol last night and another 2mg IV this morning, which had a good effect. The patient also received repletion of potassium and free water for hypernatremia. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.

The patient is currently on several medications including heparin sodium at 1,700 units/hour, labetalol at 2.5 mg/min, famotidine (Pepcid), and metoprolol. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 167/87 to 212/125 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's weight is 159.1 kg, and height is 57 inches.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and troponin-T. The patient's potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal range. The patient's albumin level is low at 2.4 g/dL. The patient's lactic acid level is elevated at 0.7 mmol/L. The patient's C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are also elevated.

The patient's imaging results show no new imaging, but previous chest X-rays reveal findings consistent with pneumonia. The patient's blood cultures from December 17 and 20 show growth of Corynebacterium species. The patient's urine culture is pending, and the results of the blood cultures from December 19, 20, and 22 are also pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include delirium/confusion, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, fever, hypertension, renal failure, pain control, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acidosis, cholangitis, and other conditions. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, further episodes of atrial fibrillation, development"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and subsequently developed sepsis after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of common bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient has multiple medical complications including delirium, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, fever, hypertension, acute renal failure, pain control, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acidosis, cholangitis, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to prolonged sedation while intubated.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has developed AFIB during rounds and requires rate control.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may have impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest and limited mobility.
4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient is experiencing fever, which could be related to an ongoing infection.
5. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension despite being on oral medications. Further evaluation and management are needed.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and dehydration. Ren"

The patient was intubated due to volume overload, body habitus, etc. but was extubated on 12/02 and has since maintained adequate respiratory status. The patient is being treated with nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia but developed corynebacteria from blood cultures, prompting a change to vancomycin on 12/20. A new right internal jugular (IJ) central line was placed on 12/04.

The patient's major issues include labile blood pressure, waxing and waning mental status, and tachycardia. The patient also experienced delirium and agitation overnight, receiving Haldol 2mg x 2 with good results.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F) with a current temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F)

   Blood cx [**12-15**] and [**12-17**] grew corynebacterium, drawn from a-line which

   Assessment and Plan
   Post-ERCP sepsis. MICU course c/b respiratory failure, volume overload,
   renal failure.
   Currently major issues are delirium, tachycardia, Corynebacterium
   bacteremia.
   Afib, with RVR. In sinus since yest afternoon. Started heparin and
   coumadin, but further discussion with ICU team reveals pt is a fall
   risk (apparently wheelchair bound at baseline, transfers on his own in
   his house by holding on to walls, furniture) and is noncompliant with
   medical visits, insulin, CPAP so I think he is unlikely to achieve safe
   dosing on coumadin.
   HTN Back on ACE-I, will restart losartan and continue beta blocker and
   ccb. If necessary can also use hydralazine.
   Delirium. Improving overall but was better yesterday than now. Probably
   got too much Haldol overnight. Recheck later today. Holding off on head
   CT because I think this is most likely combination of meds and ICU
   psychosis, and because he is unlikely to fit in the scanner, but would
   consider if not improved within a few days.
   Renal fctn improved.
   Corynebacterium bacteremia: Vanc/naf for which occured while on naf. 2
   wk vanc for corynebacterium. 2 wk course naf for MSSA bacteremia (ends
   [**12-24**]).
   Other issues per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted with cholangitis after undergoing an ERCP procedure. He developed volume overload and was intubated, but was subsequently extubated on 12/02. The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressure, waxing and waning mental status, and tachycardia. He has been receiving nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, which was later changed to vancomycin due to the growth of Corynebacteria from blood cultures. A new right internal jugular (IJ) central line was placed on 12/04. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has altered mental status, which may be indicative of delirium or confusion.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not managed properly.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin condition is not assessed, indicating a potential risk for impaired skin integrity, which can increase the likelihood of pressure ulcers or infections.
4. Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, not Fever of Unknown Origin): The patient has had intermittent fevers, suggesting a possible infection or inflammatory process.
5. Hypertension, Benign:"

   Blood cx [**12-15**] and [**12-17**] grew corynebacterium, drawn from a-line which

   Assessment and Plan
   Post-ERCP sepsis. MICU course c/b respiratory failure, volume overload,
   renal failure.
   Currently major issues are delirium, afib with RVR, Corynebacterium
   bacteremia.
   Afib, afib with RVR. In sinus since yest afternoon. Started heparin and
   coumadin, but further discussion with ICU team reveals pt is a fall
   risk (apparently wheelchair bound at baseline, transfers on his own in
   his house by holding on to walls, furniture) and is noncompliant with
   medical visits, insulin, CPAP so I think he is unlikely to achieve safe
   dosing on coumadin.
   HTN Back on ACE-I, will restart losartan and continue beta blocker and
   ccb.
   Delirium. Improved today (according to MICU team).
   Probably got too much Haldol overnight. Recheck later today. Holding
   off on head CT because I think this is most likely combination of meds
   and ICU psychosis, and because he is unlikely to fit in the scanner,
   but would consider if not improved within a few days.
   Renal fctn improved.
   Corynebacterium bacteremia: Vanc/naf for which occured while on naf. 2
   wk vanc for corynebacterium. 2 wk course naf for MSSA bacteremia (ends
   [**12-24**]).

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with morbid obesity who was admitted with cholangitis after an ERCP procedure. He has been intubated due to volume overload and body habitus, but was extubated on 12/02 and has maintained adequate respiratory status since then. The patient has been on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, but grew Corynebacteria from blood cultures, so the antibiotic was changed to vancomycin on 12/20. A new right internal jugular (IJ) central line was placed on 12/04. The patient also has delirium, labile blood pressure, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/68 mmHg to 212/125 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm on EKG.

The patient's physical examination reveals morbid obesity, distant heart sounds, irregular irregular pulse, diminished breath sounds, trace lower extremity edema, and warm skin without rash. Neurologically, the patient is lethargic and not following commands, but movement is purposeful. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 10"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, morbid obesity, and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure with stent placement, extraction of common bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient developed sepsis and was intubated due to volume overload and body habitus. He was extubated on [**12-18**]. The patient is currently experiencing altered mental status, Corynebacterium bacteremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and acute respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is showing signs of altered mental status, which may be related to prolonged sedation while intubated. It is important to monitor for any changes in cognitive function and consider further evaluation with neuroimaging, thyroid function tests, and possibly an EEG if the delirium persists or worsens.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has Corynebacterium and MSSA bacteremia. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and nafcillin has been initiated, and the patient's response to treatment should be closely monitored. Repeated cultures and consultation with an infectious disease specialist are recommended.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Antiarrhythmic medications like metoprolol should be continued, and the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. Subsequently, he developed sepsis. He was intubated due to volume overload and body habitus, and extubated on [**12-18**]. He now presents with altered mental status, Corynebacterium bacteremia, in and out of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: Likely delirium related to prolonged sedation while intubated. Normal electrolytes and improvement during the course of the day yesterday suggest a metabolic process is unlikely.
   - CT head, TSH, RPR, B12/folate
   - If w/u neg, consider neuro consult and/or EEG
   - EKG shows baseline mildly prolonged QTc
   - Haldol prn

2. Corynebacterium and MSSA bacteremia: Now on Vanc, day 1: [**12-20**] pm for likely 2-week course and nafcillin with planned course through [**12-24**].
   - Vanc trough this AM high at 25, decreased dose to 1000 q12h yesterday. Continue current dose"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to prolonged sedation while intubated or other underlying causes.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has in and out of afib/aflutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR). This condition needs to be managed properly to maintain heart rate control.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has large bruises on the right abdomen and hematuria, indicating possible impaired skin integrity. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and prevent further complications.

4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has had episodes of elevated temperature, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.

5. Hypertension, Benign: The patient has episodes of high blood pressure, which needs to be monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart problems.

6. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Kidney Injury, AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, possibly due to sepsis or other factors. Proper management is crucial to prevent further renal damage.

7. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to cholangitis. Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, ongoing monitoring is"

   sepsis.  Intubated due to volume overload and body habitus and
   extubated [**12-18**].  Now with altered mental status, corynebacteria
   bacteremia, in and out of afib/aflutter with RVR.
   #  afib: per chart, possible [**Last Name **] problem.  In and out of sinus.
   Heparin gtt and coumadin started 3 days ago, but stopped 2 days ago
   after further chart review; pt with poor medical compliance and history
   of falls, felt to be poor coumadin candidate.  Currently poor rate
   control.
   -continue dilt gtt, start heparin gtt
   -PO Metoprolol
   - 1L NS given this am given rapid diuresis
   -if still with HR 140s at end of rounds, would consider amiodarone for
   chemical cardioversion
    # Altered Mental Status: Most likely delirium, and felt to be related
   to prolonged sedation while intubated.  Unlikely to be metabolic
   process given normal electrolytes.  CT head, TSH, RPR, B12/folate
   negative.
   - consider neuro consult and EEG
   -contact patient
s phone numbers from cell to determine baseline
   -EKG shows baseline mildly prolonged QTc

   #  corneybacterium and MSSA bacteremia:  now on Vanc, day 1: [**12-20**] pm

   dose of coumadin
   -consider DIC panel, LFTs
   #. Respiratory failure with b/l pleural effusions on CXR.   Moreover,
   resp failure was likely redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Tolerating bipap at night.  On RA
   during day.
    -continue to monitor I/O
   - hold lasix for now given rapid diuresis
   - CXR now
   -continue bipap at night for likely OSA
   # Hypertension: Pt cleared for POs and better controlled on PO meds
   though still has episodes to 220s SBP.
   - PO amlodipine, lisinopril,  metoprolol, olmesartan, lasix for now
   - consider standing hydral PO if above measures do not work
   # SEPSIS: Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all pressors.  Likely he
   was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection from cholangitis.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and
   purulent material.  Per ID, catheter tip with coag negative staph is
   likely contaminant and no need to broaden coverage.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with common bile duct (CBD) stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. After the procedure, he developed sepsis and was intubated due to volume overload and body habitus. He was extubated on [**12-18**]. 

The patient's current conditions include delirium, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), altered mental status (not delirium), impaired skin integrity, fever, hypertension, renal failure, pain control, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acidosis, cholangitis, and possibly deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics for Corynebacterium bacteremia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, anticoagulation with heparin and Coumadin, sedation, diuretics, and medications for blood pressure control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, further deterioration of mental status, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobilization, progression of cholangitis, and potential septic shock."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stent placement, extraction of common bile duct (CBD) stones, and subsequent sepsis. The patient was intubated due to volume overload and body habitus and extubated on [**12-18**].

Current Issues:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is likely delirium related to prolonged sedation while intubated. Further investigation is needed, including a neuro consult and EEG.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has intermittent episodes of AFIB/aflutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Poor rate control is observed, and heparin and diltiazem have been started.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has large bruises on his right abdomen and hematuria, indicating potential skin integrity issues.
4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has had intermittent fever spikes throughout his stay.
5. Hypertension, Benign: The patient has episodes of high blood pressure despite being on multiple antihyp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with bile duct stent placement, extraction of bile duct stones, and sphincterotomy. Post-procedure, he developed sepsis and was intubated due to volume overload and body habitus. He was extubated on [**12-18**]. Currently, he presents with altered mental status, Corynebacterium bacteremia, and in-and-out atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to prolonged sedation while intubated. Further neurologic recommendations should be followed, and an MRI may be considered.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has Corynebacterium bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin for a likely two-week course. Nafcillin will also be continued through [**12-25**].
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has intermittent AFib, which was converted to sinus rhythm yesterday using amiodarone.
4. Hypertension: The patient has benign hypertension that is still episodic despite being on PO medications.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. The patient subsequently developed sepsis and was intubated due to volume overload and body habitus. He has since been extubated and is now presenting with altered mental status, Corynebacterium bacteremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), renal failure, and cholangitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status is likely delirium, possibly related to prolonged sedation while intubated. Normal electrolytes make a metabolic process unlikely.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has Corynebacterium and MSSA bacteremia. He is currently on vancomycin and planned to continue until [**12-25**]. Nafcillin has been added for planned course through [**12-25**].
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has been in and out of AFIB/aflutter with RVR. Amiodarone has been used for conversion, and the patient is now on metoprolol for rate control.
4. Hypertension: The patient has benign hypertension that is better controlled on oral medications but still"

- The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese male with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis.
- He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent ERCP with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy.
- Post-procedure, he developed sepsis and required intubation due to volume overload and body habitus. He was extubated on [**12-18**].
- Since then, the patient has experienced altered mental status, corynebacteria bacteremia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypertension, acute renal failure, and cholangitis.
- The patient was converted from AFIB to sinus rhythm at 05:30 PM on [**12-24**] after being in aflutter with amiodarone.
- He received amiodarone via gtt until 03:00 PM on [**12-24**] and then 400mg daily. Metoprolol is given PO, and further cardiology recommendations are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with placement of a common bile duct (CBD) stent, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. Following the procedure, he developed sepsis and required intubation. He is now experiencing altered mental status, corynebacteria bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, acute renal failure, and possible stress ulcers. The patient's medical history includes poor compliance and a history of falls, making him a poor candidate for warfarin therapy. He has also been diagnosed with cholangitis and is scheduled for repeat ERCP in one week to remove the stent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to prolonged sedation while intubated. It is important to address this promptly as delirium can progress to severe agitation, increased risk of falls, and worsening overall condition.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has been experiencing episodes of AFib, which can lead to a rapid heart rate and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure. It is crucial to manage this condition effectively through medication and possibly consider cardioversion if appropriate.

3. Hypertension: Despite being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of delirium. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and was previously on amiodarone, metoprolol, and lasix. The patient's current medications include haloperidol, hydralazine, and amiodarone.

Overnight events include the patient experiencing coffee ground emesis at 1 AM, which was positive for occult blood. The patient also had rapid atrial fibrillation at 5:30 AM and was given IV lopressor. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 124 bpm, blood pressure 92/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 96%. The patient's flow sheet data shows a weight of 166.5 kg, fluid balance negative 1159 mL since 12 AM, and urine output 2830 mL.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count at 291 K/uL, low hemoglobin at 8.8 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.6 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose at 343 mg/dL. The patient's PT/PTT/INR are elevated at 16.8/36.4/1.5, respectively. Other lab values are within normal range.

   65 year-old morbidly obese gentleman w/ DM2 and history of
   cholecystitis admitted for cholangitis, s/p ERCP w/ CBD stent
   placement, extraction of CBD stones and sphincterotomy and subsequent
   sepsis.  Intubated due to volume overload and body habitus and
   extubated [**12-18**].  Now with altered mental status, corynebacteria
   bacteremia, in and out of afib/aflutter with RVR.
   # hematemesis: o/n team felt that because of increased diet.  Could be
   a gastroenteritis given concurrent diarrhea though seems that he has
   had that all along.  Could also be a stress ulcer as he has been in the
   ICU, however has been on an H2 blocker.  MS change not significant to
   warrant reimaging.
   -check coags as below
   -type and screen
   -consider NG tube and GI consult
   # Altered Mental Status: Most likely delirium, and felt to be related
   to prolonged sedation while intubated.  Unlikely to be metabolic
   process given normal electrolytes.  CT head, TSH, RPR, B12/folate
   negative.
   -appreciate neuro and psych recs
   - MRI will be unlikely given clinical condition and the fact that it
   would not change treatment
   -haldol prn
   -psych consult
   -per psych, If haldol does not provide adequate sedation could use
   quetiapine 25-50 at hs to try to normalize sleep-wake cycle, Avoid
   benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, narcotic analgesia
   #  afib: per chart, possible [**Last Name **] problem.  In and out of sinus.
   Heparin gtt and coumadin started then stopped after further chart
   review; pt with poor medical compliance and history of falls, felt to
   be poor coumadin candidate.  Converted o/n with IV Lopressor
   - Amiodarone gtt
   -PO Metoprolol
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]
 Cr worsening likely from increased diuresis, likely was a
   combination of ATN and prerenal etiologies.
   - will continue to trend BUN/Cr
   -send urine lytes as not checked since [**12-15**]
   #  corneybacterium and MSSA bacteremia:  now on Vanc, day 1: [**12-20**] pm
   for likely 2 week course and nafcillin d/c
d this am.
   -check Vanc trough tomorrow am given change in dosing to 750mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # UTI: on Cipro. D1: [**12-23**] for planned 7 day course
   -f/u ctx is negative
   # elevated INR: was downtrending.  Likely from poor vitamin K stores
   after 1 dose of warfarin
   -checking this am given hematemesis
   #. Respiratory failure with b/l pleural effusions on CXR.   Moreover,
   resp failure was likely redistribution of fluid from cholangitis/
   bacteremia, which is now improving.   Tolerated bipap at night.  On RA
   during day.
     -continue to monitor I/O
   # Hypertension: Pt cleared for POs and better controlled on PO meds
   though still has episodes to 220s SBP.
   - goal even to net negative 1L over day
   - PO amlodipine, lisinopril,  metoprolol, olmesartan, with home lasix
   added yesterday
   - stop lasix and readdress on a daily need given elevated Cr and
   vomiting
   - consider standing hydral PO if above measures do not work
   # SEPSIS: Hypotension now resolved, weaned off all pressors.  Likely he
   was hypotensive from sepsis from known infection from cholangitis.
   Patient is s/p ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old morbidly obese gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and a history of cholecystitis. He was admitted for cholangitis and underwent ERCP with CBD stent placement, extraction of CBD stones, and sphincterotomy. He subsequently developed sepsis and was intubated due to volume overload and body habitus. 

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Altered mental status, most likely delirium related to prolonged sedation while intubated.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
3. Hypertension.
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF).
5. Cholangitis.
6. Corynebacterium bacteremia, currently being treated with vancomycin.
7. Urinary tract infection (UTI), being treated with ciprofloxacin.
8. Elevated INR, likely due to poor vitamin K stores after one dose of warfarin.
9. Respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray.
10. Hypotension, now resolved.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:
1. Potential worsening of renal failure due to continued use of diuretics.
2. Possible development of further infections, especially considering the presence of a urinary tract infection and bacteremia.
3. Risk of recurrent episodes of AF"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to prolonged sedation while intubated. It is important to manage this condition with appropriate sedation medications and avoid benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, and narcotic analgesia.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has been in and out of sinus rhythm, with episodes of atrial fibrillation. Management includes the use of antiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone and metoprolol to control heart rate and rhythm.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has shown worsening creatinine levels, indicating possible acute renal failure. It is important to monitor kidney function and adjust diuretic therapy accordingly.

4. Cholangitis: The patient initially presented with cholangitis and underwent ERCP with stent placement. Repeat ERCP may be necessary in the future to remove the stent.

5. Bacteremia and Infection: The patient has had bacteremia with Corynebacterium and MSSA, now being treated with vancomycin. Other infections, such as urinary tract infection (UTI), should also be monitored and treated appropriately.

6. Hypertension: The patient has episodes of high blood pressure, which needs to be managed with antihypertensive medications.

   He has improved so that now his most active issue is his altered MS.
   Seems better controlled on Haldol but it is unclear what his new
   baseline will be.  With CT showing signif atrophy he has some baseline
   deficit but is not at we understand his baseline to be.  Has been
   substantially diuresed but we think he is close to euvolemic now.  Will
   place on standing lasix.  Hct is stable but low - suspect some in
   anemia of chronic dis but with low MCV we are sending Fe studies
