","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is currently intubated and sedated, with stable vital signs including a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 95/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is within normal range, indicating adequate tissue perfusion. He is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.18 mcg/kg/min to maintain blood pressure and piperacillin/tazobactam for antibiotic coverage. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of a scrotal mass and cholecystitis. Physical examination reveals symmetric chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absence of lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (31.8 K/uL) and hematocrit (31.7%), with normal platelet count (225 K/uL). Blood glucose level is slightly elevated (128 mg/dL), while serum creatinine is within normal range (1.3 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cholecystitis. He is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to remain in the ICU for further management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a medical history of dementia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was initially admitted to [**Hospital3**] with rapid atrial fibrillation and later transferred to [**Hospital1**] due to septic shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, Zosyn, phenylephrine, norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. He is currently on low-dose neosynephrine for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, and his hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being closely monitored.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and lactic acid levels. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, differential counts, electrolytes, and CXR, are within normal ranges.

Imaging studies reveal a distended gallbladder with sludge and a calcified collection on the scrotal sac suggestive of a post-traumatic cyst. Additionally, the patient has a heterogeneous sh"

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and other supportive measures to manage his symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggests sepsis. If left untreated, it can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cholecystitis: If the patient's cholecystitis is not managed appropriately, it can lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture or abscess formation.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and compromised wound healing.
5. Cardiac Issues: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac dysfunction may increase the risk of arrhythmias, heart failure, or other cardiac complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical progress to prevent or manage these"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with symptoms of dark/black vomit, rigors, tachypnea, and tachycardia. He has a history of prostate issues, acute renal failure (ARF), and bilateral hydronephrosis related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient was unable to be catheterized and underwent invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. He also has impaired skin integrity, a scrotal mass likely calcified hydrocele, and cholecystitis. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, pressors, and other ICU medications. His vital signs are stable, but he remains in the ICU with ongoing monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is currently dealing with several medical conditions that could potentially lead to complications. These include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cholecystitis. The impaired skin integrity increases the risk of infection and tissue breakdown. The respiratory failure puts the patient at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Sepsis without organ dysfunction can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Additionally, the presence of cholecystitis indicates a potential complication related to gallbladder inflammation and possible gallstone formation. It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage these"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of COPD and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the hospital with urosepsis and shortness of breath. He was intubated in the emergency department and extubated the next morning. Blood cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. The patient has a scrotal mass that is likely a calcified hydrocele, and his prostate issues include acute renal failure (ARF) and bilateral hydronephrosis due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was unable to void after Foley catheter removal, and his urologist recommended transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and frequent urination every four hours. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute cholecystitis, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. His vital signs are stable, and he is currently off invasive ventilation but still requires low-flow oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or infections if not properly managed.
2. Scrotal Mass: The scrotal mass, likely a calcified hydrocele, may cause discomfort or complications if it becomes infected or if tumor markers indicate malignancy.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient's acute cholecystitis may lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presented to the hospital with urosepsis and shortness of breath. The patient was intubated in the emergency department and extubated the next morning. He has been receiving invasive ventilation, but it was stopped today. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and urine cultures have grown Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and his lactate levels are high, indicating possible sepsis. He also has an abdominal mass, likely cholecystitis, and a scrotal mass, which is likely a calcified hydrocele. The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pulmonary edema related to sepsis or mental status changes. His atrial fibrillation responded to fluids and he is now in sinus rhythm. The patient's INR is above 3 due to antibiotic use, so he will continue to hold coumadin. Tumor markers are pending to evaluate the scrotal mass. The patient's dark vomit is being monitored, and he will continue on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's code status is full code, and he will receive ICU care for now.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male admitted with probable urosepsis. He has been extubated, weaned off pressors, evaluated by urology, and cultures are pending. The patient wishes to remain full code. There are no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam at 07:00 AM on 12/27/2147. Infusions include Neosynephrine, and other ICU medications include Miconazole, Pantoprazole, and heparin sc. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-appearing, with slight dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, irregular heart rhythm, swollen right knee, and numerous hyperkeratotic patches on the face and scalp. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be alert and oriented, with movement in all extremities.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (31.8 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (9.1 g/dL), decreased platelet count (225), increased creatinine (1.3), and other abnormalities in electrolyte levels. Urine culture shows E. coli, OSH sensitive to quinolones, ampicillin, and amp/sulbactam. Blood culture is negative for growth.

Assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, likely urosepsis with E."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis from a urinary tract infection (UTI). He has a history of urine retention and was admitted with urosepsis. The patient has been treated with cefepime and metronidazole, and his central line has been discontinued. His blood pressure remains stable without the need for pressors. However, he has tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

24-hour events include discontinuation of central line, remaining stable off pressors, and testing positive for C. diff. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/71 to 130/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals bilateral crackles over the lower half of lung fields, mild bilateral edema, and soft abdomen with no tenderness or bowel sounds. The patient is alert and oriented, with warm extremities and no other significant findings.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 31.8 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 85 mg/dL, hyponat"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of COPD and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for urosepsis and shortness of breath. The patient has been treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, and metronidazole for his urosepsis. He is currently extubated and doing well on nasal cannula oxygen. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/71 mmHg to 130/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and has a slightly elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.7.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with urosepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and response to antibiotics is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated but has now been successfully extubated. Monitoring his respiratory status and oxygenation is important to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his current INR is slightly elevated. This may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring coagulation parameters and adjusting antico"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and atrial fibrillation, who presents with urosepsis and shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 119/71 to 130/75 mmHg, heart rate between 77 and 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis/hypotension, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and dark emesis. He is being treated with cefepime for urosepsis, vancomycin for severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and lasix for fluid management. The patient's blood cultures have been obtained, and he is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of worsening sepsis or hypotension. It is important to ensure adequate fluid resuscitation and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated and doing well, there is a risk of reintubation if"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and atrial fibrillation, who presented with urosepsis and shortness of breath. The patient was admitted to the ICU and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving various antibiotics for the urosepsis, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and cefepime. The patient also has Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection and is being treated with metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure of 119/71 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is still experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled with medication.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood cultures have been drawn and the patient's microbiology results indicate an E. coli infection, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics but sensitive to Zosyn, cefazolin, and cefepime. Imaging shows stable cardiomegaly, worsening pulmonary vascular congestion, and unchanged bibasilar retrocardiac opacities.

Plan:

1. Continue cefepime for urosepsis for a "
