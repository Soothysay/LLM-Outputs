","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and malignancy metastatic to the liver. The patient presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and a new diagnosis of cancer (CA) metastatic to the liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to hypothermia, leukocytosis, acidosis, and evidence of an infectious focus. The most likely source of infection is pneumonia (PNA) or a hepatobiliary source.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be attributed to hypovolemia (poor intake, diarrhea, potential gastrointestinal blood loss), sepsis, or other causes such as cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism (PE), pericardial effusion/tamponade, or adrenal insufficiency.
3. Chest/shoulder pain: The patient's chest pain may represent atypical acute coronary syndrome (ACS), referred pain from pleura in the setting of PNA, esophageal process/hiatal hernia reflux, intraabdominal process (splenic/diaphragmatic abscess), or musculoskeletal pain.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and malignancy metastatic to the liver. He presents with sepsis, hypotension, and a new diagnosis of cancer. The patient has multiple medical complications including aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury (ARF), liver dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, anemia, chronic back pain, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to hypothermia, leukocytosis, acidosis, and evidence of an infectious focus. The most likely source of infection is pneumonia or a hepatobiliary source. The patient is already receiving appropriate treatment with antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or sepsis. Other differential diagnoses include cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism (PE), pericardial effusion/tamponade, and adrenal insufficiency. Aggressive fluid repletion and monitoring of urine output are recommended.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has an increased left perihilar opacity on chest X-ray, which is concerning for aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Aspiration precautions should be continued, and the patient's dysphagia"

   .
   #Chest/shoulder pain - [**Month (only) 8**] represent atypical ACS, first set of CE's
   negative, EKG did show TWI inferiorly but no evolving changes; may also
   represent referred pain from pleura in the setting of PNA or esophageal

   risk given malignancy
   -duplex U/S to r/o DVT
   -TTE to eval for evidence of PE
   .
   #Abnormal LFT's - Diffuse metastatic disease (? esophageal primary) by
   RUQ U/S, but could not adequately visualize biliary tree. Low
   albumin/elevated INR suggest diminished synthetic function. Markedly
   elevated Alk phos/AST with T Bili 2X ULN suggests a cholestatic pattern
   of liver injury such as intrahepatic cholestasis (i.e. in the setting
   of sepsis) or biliary obstruction (given high amylase/lipase) although
   no epigastric tenderness. 300>AST>ALT invokes ETOH, but he denies.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer (CA) metastatic to the liver. He presents with sepsis, hypotension, and chest/shoulder pain. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 112/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets criteria for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. In this case, the infectious focus could be pneumonia or a hepatobiliary source. Given the presence of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) in the colon, there is a risk of worsening diarrhea and further complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia (poor intake, diarrhea, possible gastrointestinal bleeding) or sepsis. Other less likely causes include cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion/tam"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer metastatic to the liver. He was admitted with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, aspiration, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, liver dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis, and dysphagia. He is currently in the ICU receiving aggressive fluid repletion, vasopressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and other supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypothermia, leukocytosis, and acidosis suggest sepsis, likely due to pneumonia or a hepatobiliary source.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be attributed to hypovolemia, sepsis, or other causes such as cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion/tamponade, or adrenal insufficiency.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels, along with the BUN/Cr ratio indicating pre-renal azotemia, suggest ARF possibly due to hypotension and/or sepsis.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis trending down, which may be contributing to the metabolic acidosis along with aggressive"

   #Sepsis - Meets criteria for sepsis given hypothermia, leukocytosis,
   acidosis and evidence for an infectious focus; most likely PNA (may
   account for referred pain/pleuritic pain) vs. hepatobiliary source,
   also c/f C. diff given loose stools; location of opacity on CXR c/f
   aspiration pneumonitis vs. PNA
   -fluid boluses to maintain CVP >[**9-24**], MAP > 65; consider starting
   levophed if MAP inadequate with frequent fluid challenges; may require
   A-line for better BP monitoring if doesn't improve
   -cont. zosyn for G-/anaerobic resp(given aspiration risk)/GI flora
   -rec'd 1 dose vanco @ OSH prior to trough level; restart vanco, recheck
   trough prior to 3rd dose
   -blood Cx pending; will send urine, sputum Cx, c. diff toxin
   -aspiration precautions
   .
   #Hypotension - DDx incl. hypovolemia (poor intake, diarrhea, ? GI blood
   loss) vs. sepsis (as above); less likely are cardiogenic shock
   (atypical chest pain in light of his PMH but unchanged EKG, first set
   of CE WNL, no clinical s/sx of CHF), PE (mildly hypoxic but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of RH strain on EKG), pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (JVP not elevated, no distant heart sounds), and
   adrenal insufficiency (on chronic steroid therapy); has received 6 L so
   far and remains hypotensive
   -Treat for sepsis and hypovolemia as above with aggressive fluid
   repletion; monitor UOP closely (goal > 40 cc/hr)
   -no ischemic changes on EKG; first cycle CE's neg @ OSH, cont. to cycle
   -TTE to eval. for PA pressures, RH strain, baseline LV fxn; kidney fxn
   likely will not permit CTA to r/o PE
   -AM cortisol difficult to interpret as patient is on chronic steroid
   therapy and received a dose of HC @ OSH ED
   -telemetry
   .
   #Chest/shoulder pain - [**Month (only) 8**] represent atypical ACS, first set of CE's
   negative, EKG did show TWI inferiorly but no evolving changes; may also
   represent referred pain from pleura in the setting of PNA or esophageal
   process/hiatal hernia reflux, intraabdominal process
   (splenic/diaphragmatic abscess), or musculoskeletal pain
   -recheck EKG with recurrent pain
   -tx for PNA as above
   -further GI w/u pending
   -lidocaine patch for analgesia
   .
   #Gap metabolic acidosis - Lactic acidosis (trending down) vs.
   accumulation of organic anions in ARF; likely contribution from
   aggressive NS volume expansion; low suspicion for ingestion ([**Month (only) 119**],
   tylenol) and denies ETOH; gap narrowing; calc osms = 317
   -ABG suggestive of concomitant respiratory alkalosis
   -serum osms (to calculate gap), [**Month (only) 119**], tylenol
   -urine ketones
   .
   #ARF - BUN/Cr ratio suggests pre-renal azotemia, ddx includes ATN in
   the setting of hypotension and/or sepsis; likely accounts for
   hypermagnesemia and hyperphosphatemia; foley in place, draining so low
   c/f obstruction
   -fluid challenge, BP support as above
   -U/A, culture, sediment, lytes
   -monitor serum lytes closely
   -UOP 60 cc (.86 cc/kg) during first hour in ICU
   -dose meds for GFR<20
   .
   #Asymmetical LE edema - calves nontender, nonerythematous, but at high
   risk given malignancy
   -duplex U/S to r/o DVT
   -TTE to eval for evidence of PE
   .
   #Abnormal LFT's
 Trending down slightly; diffuse metastatic disease (?
   esophageal primary) by RUQ U/S, but could not adequately visualize
   biliary tree. Low albumin/elevated INR suggest diminished synthetic
   function. Markedly elevated Alk phos/AST with T Bili 2X ULN suggests a
   cholestatic pattern of liver injury such as intrahepatic cholestasis
   (i.e. in the setting of sepsis) or biliary obstruction (given high
   amylase/lipase) although no epigastric tenderness. 300>AST>ALT invokes
   ETOH, but he denies.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recent diagnosis of cancer metastatic to the liver. The patient presents with sepsis, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient has received fluid boluses and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. There is also concern for aspiration pneumonitis due to a large hiatal hernia seen on chest X-ray.

The patient has multiple comorbidities and is at high risk for various complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation may lead to respiratory failure if adequate ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.

3. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): If sepsis progresses, it can lead to MODS, where multiple organs fail due to inadequate perfusion and dysfunction.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated BUN/Cr ratio suggestive of pre-renal azotemia, possibly due to hypotension and sepsis. AKI can further worsen if not managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer metastatic to the liver. He presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension. The patient has several medical complications including aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and abnormal liver function tests. He also has asymmetrical lower extremity edema, which raises suspicion for deep vein thrombosis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, sepsis, and potential respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of aspiration, as indicated by the increased left perihilar opacity on the chest X-ray. This can lead to pneumonia and should be treated promptly.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated baseline creatinine level and decreased urine output, suggesting AKI. It is important to monitor urine output closely and manage fluid balance carefully.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a low TCO2 and high lactic acid levels, indicating metabolic acidosis. This may be due to lactic acidosis or accumulation of organic anions in acute renal failure.

4. Abnormal Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, suggesting liver dysfunction. This could be due to diffuse metastatic disease or cholestatic pattern"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and colon cancer with metastasis to the liver. He presents with sepsis, hypotension, and chest pain. The patient has been receiving fluid boluses and is being treated for pneumonia (PNA) and aspiration pneumonia. There is also a concern for acute kidney injury (ARF) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately. Aggressive fluid repletion and antibiotics are being administered.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hypotension and guide appropriate management.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest ARF. Close monitoring of renal function and careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance are crucial.
4. Pneumonia (PNA) and Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest the presence of PNA and aspiration pneumonitis. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics and aspiration precautions are in place.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and now diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer. He presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, hypotension, and is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's new lateral ST depressions on EKG and atypical chest pain suggest unstable angina, which could progress to ACS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and lab findings indicate sepsis, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia or a hepatobiliary source.
3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, possibly due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), suggesting iron deficiency anemia, possibly exacerbated by chronic gastrointestinal bleeding from malignancy.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactic acidosis or accumulation of organic anions in acute renal failure (ARF).
6. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated BUN/Cr ratio, low urine sodium concentration, and active urinary sediment suggest pre-renal azotemia, possibly due to hypotension and/or"

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac
   index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There are filamentous
   strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences
   (normal variant). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary
   hypertension.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current symptoms, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Unstable angina: The patient's presentation of atypical chest pain, EKG changes, and risk factors such as a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery indicate unstable angina. This condition requires immediate attention and management to prevent further cardiac complications.

2. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of hypotension, fever, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Given the presence of pneumonia and the potential for metastatic cancer contributing to an immunocompromised state, it is crucial to address this condition promptly.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels, along with signs of pre-renal azotemia, indicate renal dysfunction. This may be due to hypotension, sepsis, or other factors. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels suggest anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could be related to chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, malignancy, or other factors.

5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG results showing a low pH and elevated lactate levels suggest metabolic acidosis. This condition requires careful management, especially considering the patient's renal dysfunction.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac
   index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There are filamentous
   strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences
   (normal variant). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary
   hypertension.

   - monitor UOP for volume status
 avoid further boluses if possible.
   Give pressors & fluids if needed.
   -place A-line for better BP monitoring
   -cont. zosyn for G-/anaerobic resp/GI flora (day [**4-26**])
   -rec'd 1 dose vanco @ OSH prior to trough level; restart vanco (day

g atypical resp organisms
   -blood, urine Cx pending; will send C. diff toxin (but refrain from
   treating unless pos) and sputum Cx if possible
   -consider diagnostic bronch if patient requires intubation.
   -aspiration precautions
   #Hypotension - DDx incl. hypovolemia (poor intake, diarrhea, ? GI blood
   loss) vs. sepsis (as above) vs. adrenal insufficiency (was recently
   started on steroid taper) ; less likely are cardiogenic shock (low CVP,
   no pulm edema, warm & dry extremities, CE
s WNL), PE (mildly hypoxic
   but not tachycardic, no evidence of RH strain on EKG; anticoagulating
   for ACS anyway), pericardial effusion/tamponade (JVP not elevated, no
   distant heart sounds)
   -Treat for sepsis and hypovolemia as above with aggressive fluid
   repletion; monitor UOP closely (goal > 40 cc/hr)
    -AM cortisol difficult to interpret as patient is on steroid therapy
   and received a dose of HC @ OSH ED; will cont. on outpatient dose of
   prednisone 40 mg daily; may require stress-dose steroids if remains
   hypotensive

   resusitation with NS.
   -avoid further fluid boluses if possible.
   -ABG suggestive of concomitant respiratory alkalosis
   -LR for volume repletion in light of hyperchloremia
   #ARF - BUN/Cr ratio, low urine NA c/w pre-renal azotemia, ddx includes
   ATN in the setting of hypotension and/or sepsis; microscopic hematuria,
   pyuria and active urinary sediment require more attention; foley in
   place, draining so low c/f obstruction

   risk given malignancy
   -duplex U/S
neg for DVT bilat.
   -systemic anticoagulation for ACS
   #Abnormal LFT's
 Trending down slightly; diffuse metastatic disease (?
   esophageal vs. lung vs. colon primary) by RUQ U/S, but could not
   adequately visualize biliary tree. Low albumin/elevated INR suggest
   diminished synthetic function. Markedly elevated Alk phos/AST with T
   Bili 2X ULN suggests a cholestatic pattern of such as intrahepatic
   cholestasis (i.e. in the setting of sepsis) or biliary obstruction
   (given high amylase/lipase)
   -will pursue contrast CT when clinically more stable, renal fxn
   improved
   #Dysphagia - c/f esophageal CA vs. lung CA with extrinsic esophageal
   compression (in light of weight loss, h/o ETOH/tob use); significant
   risk factor for aspiration; hiatal hernia appreciated on CXR
   -GI C/S re: EGD when clinically more stable
   -aspiration precautions
   -consider speech/swallow C/S when more stable
   #COPD - no s/sx acute exacerbation
   -cont. outpatient INH meds
   -albuterol nebs PRN

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, previous CABG, and current ACS, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's COPD and recent PNA increase the risk of respiratory complications like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or exacerbation of COPD.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o M h/o CAD s/p CABG, CVA, HTN, COPD p/w atypical chest pain,
   sepsis, and hypotension in the setting of PNA and a new diagnosis of CA
   metastatic to the liver.
   #ACS
 new lateral ST-depr. assoc. with atypical chest pain, different
   from pain described on admission, c/w unstable angina more likely than
   demand ischemia; CE
s neg x 2; given O2, morphine, SL nitro, [**Telephone/Fax (3) 119**]
   -morphine, nitro PRN until pain-free f/b repeat EKG
   - consider Nitro gtt if pain returns
   -heparin gtt, goal PTT: 60-80
   -cont. [**Last Name (LF) 120**], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**]
   -cont. cycle CE
   -start low-dose B-blocker if BP allows
   -telemetry
   -monitor EKG for resolution of ST changes.
   #Sepsis - Most likely from aspiration PNA, also consider
   post-obstructive PNA from ? primary lung CA, hepatobiliary source, C.
   diff
   - monitor UOP for volume status
 avoid further boluses if possible.
   Give pressors & fluids if needed.
   -place A-line for better BP monitoring
   -cont. zosyn for G-/anaerobic resp/GI flora (day [**5-27**])
   -rec'd 1 dose vanco @ OSH prior to trough level; restart vanco (day
   [**5-27**]) , recheck trough on AM [**8-26**]
   -add azithromycin (day [**4-17**]) for cov
g atypical resp organisms
   -blood, urine Cx pending; will send C. diff toxin (but refrain from
   treating unless pos) and sputum Cx if possible
   -consider diagnostic bronch if patient requires intubation.
   -aspiration precautions
   #Hypotension - DDx incl. hypovolemia (poor intake, diarrhea, ? GI blood
   loss) vs. sepsis (as above) vs. adrenal insufficiency (was recently
   started on steroid taper) ; less likely are cardiogenic shock (low CVP,
   no pulm edema, warm & dry extremities, CE
s WNL), PE (mildly hypoxic
   but not tachycardic, no evidence of RH strain on EKG; anticoagulating
   for ACS anyway), pericardial effusion/tamponade (JVP not elevated, no
   distant heart sounds)
   -Treat for sepsis and hypovolemia as above with aggressive fluid
   repletion; monitor UOP closely (goal > 40 cc/hr)
    -AM cortisol difficult to interpret as patient is on steroid therapy
   and received a dose of HC @ OSH ED; will cont. on outpatient dose of
   prednisone 40 mg daily; may require stress-dose steroids if remains
   hypotensive
   #Anemia - no known b/l; low MCV suggests Fe-deficiency likely in the
   setting of malignancy and chronic GI blood loss; may be a component of
   ACD; guaiac +
   -follow clinically & Hct [**Hospital1 **] while on heparin gtt
   -T&C, x-fuse for < 28%
   #metabolic acidosis -  Anion gap closed.  Likely due to fluid
   resusitation with NS.
   -avoid further fluid boluses if possible.
   -ABG suggestive of concomitant respiratory alkalosis
   -LR for volume repletion in light of hyperchloremia
   #ARF - BUN/Cr ratio, low urine NA c/w pre-renal azotemia, ddx includes
   ATN in the setting of hypotension and/or sepsis; microscopic hematuria,
   pyuria and active urinary sediment require more attention; foley in
   place, draining so low c/f obstruction
   -Continue to monitor
   -fluid challenge, BP support as above
   -monitor serum lytes
   -goal UOP > 40 cc/hr
   -dose meds for GFR<20
   #Asymmetical LE edema - calves nontender, nonerythematous, but at high
   risk given malignancy
   -duplex U/S
neg for DVT bilat.
   -systemic anticoagulation for ACS
   #Abnormal LFT's
 Trending down slightly; diffuse metastatic disease (?
   esophageal vs. lung vs. colon primary) by RUQ U/S, but could not
   adequately visualize biliary tree. Low albumin/elevated INR suggest
   diminished synthetic function. Markedly elevated Alk phos/AST with T
   Bili 2X ULN suggests a cholestatic pattern of such as intrahepatic
   cholestasis (i.e. in the setting of sepsis) or biliary obstruction
   (given high amylase/lipase)
   -will pursue contrast CT when clinically more stable, renal fxn
   improved
   #Dysphagia - c/f esophageal CA vs. lung CA with extrinsic esophageal
   compression (in light of weight loss, h/o ETOH/tob use); significant
   risk factor for aspiration; hiatal hernia appreciated on CXR
   -GI C/S re: EGD when clinically more stable
   -aspiration precautions
   -consider speech/swallow C/S when more stable
   #COPD - no s/sx acute exacerbation
   -cont. outpatient INH meds
   -albuterol nebs PRN
   -prednisone 40 mg daily
   -Inhaled moisturized air for dry mouth
   -Insentive spirometry.
   #HTN
   -holding antihypertensives while BP low
   #Hyperlipidemia
   -holding crestor [**3-16**] elevated LFT's
   #Chronic back pain
   -lidocaine patch
   -avoid NSAIDs, ibuprofen since ARF and at risk for GIB
   -avoid tylenol since LFTs elevated
 if required can have 2g max per
   day.
   #F/E/N
   -LR boluses (in light of hyperchloremia) to maintain CVP, MAP as above,
   UOP > 40 cc/hr

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and metastatic cancer to the liver. He was admitted to the ICU for chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension. His current diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, sepsis, hypotension, anemia, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, deep vein thrombosis, abnormal liver function tests, dysphagia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic back pain, and fever/neutropenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient is at risk for further cardiac events, including myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Sepsis: Due to his immunocompromised state and recent infections, the patient is at high risk for developing sepsis and its associated complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure puts him at risk for organ perfusion and possible shock.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction, which can lead to further kidney damage if not managed properly.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient has cancer and is immobilized, he is at an increased risk for developing blood clots in his legs, which can potentially travel to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension. The patient also has a new diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer to the liver. 

24-hour events include the patient experiencing gas pains in the chest, which were relieved with Maalox. The patient's son recently passed away from liver disease related to ethanol use. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a face tent. The patient is alert and oriented, but has dysarthria. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the left base, soft abdomen with no tenderness, warm and dry extremities with positive pitting edema bilaterally.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.8 thousand/mm3, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. Liver function tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase levels, with low albumin. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include treating the patient's sepsis with appropriate antibiotics, managing pain, and addressing other medical"

   -cont. cycle CE
   -start low-dose B-blocker if BP allows
   -telemetry
   -monitor EKG for resolution of ST changes.
   #Sepsis - Most likely from aspiration PNA, also consider
   post-obstructive PNA from ? primary lung CA, hepatobiliary source, C.
   diff
   - monitor UOP for volume status
 avoid further boluses if possible.
   Give pressors & fluids if needed.
   -place A-line for better BP monitoring
   -cont. zosyn for G-/anaerobic resp/GI flora (day [**5-27**])
   -rec'd 1 dose vanco @ OSH prior to trough level; restart vanco (day
   [**5-27**]) , recheck trough on AM [**8-26**]
   -add azithromycin (day [**4-17**]) for cov
g atypical resp organisms
   -blood, urine Cx pending; will send C. diff toxin (but refrain from
   treating unless pos) and sputum Cx if possible
   -consider diagnostic bronch if patient requires intubation.
   -aspiration precautions
   #Hypotension - DDx incl. hypovolemia (poor intake, diarrhea, ? GI blood
   loss) vs. sepsis (as above) vs. adrenal insufficiency (was recently
   started on steroid taper) ; less likely are cardiogenic shock (low CVP,
   no pulm edema, warm & dry extremities, CE
s WNL), PE (mildly hypoxic
   but not tachycardic, no evidence of RH strain on EKG; anticoagulating
   for ACS anyway), pericardial effusion/tamponade (JVP not elevated, no
   distant heart sounds)
   -Treat for sepsis and hypovolemia as above with aggressive fluid
   repletion; monitor UOP closely (goal > 40 cc/hr)
    -AM cortisol difficult to interpret as patient is on steroid therapy
   and received a dose of HC @ OSH ED; will cont. on outpatient dose of
   prednisone 40 mg daily; may require stress-dose steroids if remains
   hypotensive
   #Anemia - no known b/l; low MCV suggests Fe-deficiency likely in the
   setting of malignancy and chronic GI blood loss; may be a component of
   ACD; guaiac +
   -follow clinically & Hct [**Hospital1 **] while on heparin gtt
   -T&C, x-fuse for < 28%
   #metabolic acidosis -  Anion gap closed.  Likely due to fluid
   resusitation with NS.
   -avoid further fluid boluses if possible.
   -ABG suggestive of concomitant respiratory alkalosis
   -LR for volume repletion in light of hyperchloremia
   #ARF - BUN/Cr ratio, low urine NA c/w pre-renal azotemia, ddx includes
   ATN in the setting of hypotension and/or sepsis; microscopic hematuria,
   pyuria and active urinary sediment require more attention; foley in
   place, draining so low c/f obstruction
   -Continue to monitor
   -fluid challenge, BP support as above
   -monitor serum lytes
   -goal UOP > 40 cc/hr
   -dose meds for GFR<20
   #Asymmetical LE edema - calves nontender, nonerythematous, but at high
   risk given malignancy
   -duplex U/S
neg for DVT bilat.
   -systemic anticoagulation for ACS
   #Abnormal LFT's
 Trending down slightly; diffuse metastatic disease (?
   esophageal vs. lung vs. colon primary) by RUQ U/S, but could not
   adequately visualize biliary tree. Low albumin/elevated INR suggest
   diminished synthetic function. Markedly elevated Alk phos/AST with T
   Bili 2X ULN suggests a cholestatic pattern of such as intrahepatic
   cholestasis (i.e. in the setting of sepsis) or biliary obstruction
   (given high amylase/lipase)
   -will pursue contrast CT when clinically more stable, renal fxn
   improved
   #Dysphagia - c/f esophageal CA vs. lung CA with extrinsic esophageal
   compression (in light of weight loss, h/o ETOH/tob use); significant
   risk factor for aspiration; hiatal hernia appreciated on CXR
   -GI C/S re: EGD when clinically more stable
   -aspiration precautions
   -consider speech/swallow C/S when more stable
   #COPD - no s/sx acute exacerbation
   -cont. outpatient INH meds
   -albuterol nebs PRN
   -prednisone 40 mg daily
   -Inhaled moisturized air for dry mouth
   -Insentive spirometry.
   #HTN
   -holding antihypertensives while BP low
   #Hyperlipidemia
   -holding crestor [**3-16**] elevated LFT's
   #Chronic back pain
   -lidocaine patch
   -avoid NSAIDs, ibuprofen since ARF and at risk for GIB
   -avoid tylenol since LFTs elevated
 if required can have 2g max per
   day.
   #F/E/N
   -LR boluses (in light of hyperchloremia) to maintain CVP, MAP as above,
   UOP > 40 cc/hr

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted for atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension in the setting of pneumonia (PNA) and a new diagnosis of cancer metastatic to the liver. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient presented with atypical chest pain, and an EKG showed new lateral ST-depression, which is consistent with ACS. He was given oxygen, morphine, and sublingual nitroglycerin. The plan is to continue monitoring his EKG for resolution of ST changes.

2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, most likely from aspiration PNA. Other potential sources include a primary lung cancer, hepatobiliary source, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He will be monitored closely for volume status, and further blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures will be sent. Antibiotics have been started, and consideration will be given to diagnostic bronchoscopy if needed.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia, seps"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presents with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer and is experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain syndrome - reversible lateral ST-depression associated with atypical chest pain consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of low diastolic blood pressure sepsis.
2. Sepsis - most likely from aspiration pneumonia, also consider post-obstructive pneumonia from primary lung cancer, hepatobiliary source, Clostridium difficile; blood pressure has been responsive to intravenous fluid boluses, no pressor requirement.
3. Gap metabolic acidosis - ABG consistent with metabolic acidosis plus respiratory alkalosis; contributing etiologies include acute kidney injury (ARF), normovolemic expansion acidosis, resolving lactic acidosis.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF) - BUN/Cr ratio, low urine Na+ consistent with pre-renal azotemia, however creatinine has leveled off above baseline after aggressive volume repletion; cellular casts in sediment invoke acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus glomerulonephritis"

The patient presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension. He also has a new diagnosis of cancer metastatic to the liver.

The patient's current condition includes reversible lateral ST-depression associated with atypical chest pain, consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of low diastolic blood pressure. There is no evidence of wall motion abnormality on echo, so treatment with heparin was given. The most recent episode of pain was not associated with EKG changes and resolved with Maalox. The patient is currently tachycardic in the face of hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis most likely from aspiration pneumonia, considering the low blood pressure that has been responsive to intravenous fluid boluses. There is also a consideration of post-obstructive pneumonia from primary lung cancer, hepatobiliary source, or Clostridium difficile.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The BUN/Cr ratio suggests pre"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension, and was found to have a new diagnosis of metastatic cancer to the liver. The patient's current condition includes chest pain syndrome, sepsis, acute kidney injury (ARF), abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), dysphagia, COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced an episode of sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening complication characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection. It is essential to continue aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction.

2. ARF: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels, as well as the presence of cellular casts in the urine. Close monitoring of renal parameters is crucial, and further evaluation with imaging studies may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.

3. Abnormal LFTs: The patient exhibits elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, suggesting liver dysfunction. This may be due to metastatic disease or biliary obstruction"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension, and was found to have metastatic liver cancer. He has multiple medical complications including reversible lateral ST-segment depression associated with demand ischemia, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), acute kidney injury (ARF), abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), dysphagia, hyperlipidemia, chronic back pain, and anemia.

Potential medical complications:
1. Reversible lateral ST-segment depression associated with demand ischemia: This indicates potential myocardial ischemia or infarction. The patient should continue to be monitored for any EKG changes and receive appropriate cardiac support.
2. Aspiration PNA: The patient is at risk for further episodes of aspiration due to dysphagia and a hiatal hernia. Aspiration precautions should be continued, and consideration should be given to diagnostic bronchoscopy.
3. ARF: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and efforts should be made to maintain urine output above 40 cc/hr. Medications should be adjusted for reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
4. Abnormal LFTs: Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He has also had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension. He was found to have a new diagnosis of metastatic cancer to the liver.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 113 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 133/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (insp/min), and oxygen saturation of 94% on a face tent. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Kidney function tests reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). Liver function tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination findings include labored breathing, tachycardia, decreased breath sounds anteriorly, and mild edema in both lower extremities.

   Bilateral pleural effusions suggested
   Some evidence of increased interstitial markings
   Has some suggestion of left upper lobe intfiltrate
   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with admission with concering symptoms of chest pain in the
   setting of pneumonia and now has evidence of metastatic disease in the
   liver but with primary tumor not well defined.  He now has hospital
   course significant for persistent intermittent episodes of chest
   discomfort and now maintains a resting tachycardia.  This raises
   significant concern in the setting of rising WBC count and suggestion
   of lower extermity edema.
   1)Tachycardia-The differential for this is broad.  He clearly has it
   persistent with wake or sleep state to make anxiety/pain as source of
   tachycardia much less likely.  He has significant inspiratory fall in
   CVP trace with respiration and admits to thirst which is suggestive of
   some volume depletion.  This is argued against by the bilateral pleural
   effusions and increased intersitial markings.  He has had transient
   response to fluids only.   Will need to determine source
   -Check CvO2
   -F/U with fluid bolus changes to look for response
   -Check albumin for oncotic pressure at this time
   -Echo is reasonable for conern of evolution in pericardial effusion in
   setting of pleural effusions if not stabilized.
   -PE raised as a possibility and in absence of capacity to use
   alternative explanations may need to continue Rx with empiric heparin
   if altenative sources not seen and improvement not achieved.
   -Further evaluation and treatment will have to be driven by source of
   circulatory compromise.
   2)Coronary Artery Disease-Patient with intermittent chest discomfort
   which is reversed with supportive Rx.  He has had no signs of new
   myocardial infarction but has concerning intermittent symptoms to
   suggest demand ischemia.
   -Will continue to monitor symptoms and treat as needed with TNG and f/u
   enzymes
   -Heparin D/C
d at this time
   3)Pneumonia
no new culture results, continue with Abx at this time.  He
   has bilateral pleural effisions with little evidence of unilateral
   predominance.   He has had an increase in WBC  count at this time which
   is of concern.
   -Continue with antibiotics
   -Will need to evaluate pleural effusions with thoracentesis for
   recurrent fever although it is suggestive of hydrostatic source.
   -Will increase steroid dosing as expected benefit for airways
   obstruction and possible source of vasodilatory state would be expected
   to benefit.
   4)Hepatic Metastatic Disease
Source is unclear, will need continued
   evaluation based on clinical stability.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which could be due to various causes such as anxiety, pain, volume depletion, or cardiac issues. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of tachycardia.

2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has intermittent chest discomfort that is reversible with supportive treatment. This suggests possible demand ischemia and raises concerns for coronary artery disease. Continuous monitoring of symptoms and treatment with TNG and follow-up enzymes are recommended.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions and an increase in white blood cell count, indicating a potential infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the pleural effusions should be evaluated with thoracentesis to determine the cause.

4. Hepatic Metastatic Disease: The patient has evidence of liver metastases, but the primary tumor is not well-defined. Further evaluation is necessary to identify the source of hepatic metastasis.

5. Potential Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, PE should be considered as a possible diagnosis. Alternative explanations should be explored, and if no alternative sources are found, empirical heparin therapy may be continued.

6. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, but still shows signs of volume depletion. Close monitoring of fluid"

   function. Dilated and hypokinetic RV. Mild mitral regurgitation.
   There is a mediastinal mass compressing the heart. This mass appears to
   be in the left pleural space. It measures 6 x 4.5 cm approximately and
   has similar echo density to lung tissue. There may be focal areas of
   calcification within the mass. It is impinging on the posterior wall of
   the left atrium but does not seem to be impairing cardiac filling. Mild
   mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-8-23**], the right
   ventricle appears mildly dilated and hypokinetic. There is now a large
   left pleural effusion. There is a mass seen within the effusion which
   was probably there on prior echo but not seen as it was iso-dense with
   the surrounding lung tissue. It can now be delineated because it is now
   surrounded by fluid.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He presents with atypical chest pain, sepsis, hypotension, and a new diagnosis of metastatic cancer to the liver. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, abnormal liver function tests, and dysphagia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia put him at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), exacerbation of COPD, and potential respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD, previous CABG, and hypotension indicate a risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Infectious complications: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis and aspiration pneumonia, which increases his risk for developing other infections like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and bloodstream infections.
4. Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic acidosis and abnormal liver function tests suggest a risk for further metabolic derangements such as electrolyte imbalances and hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury and pre-existing chronic kidney disease increase his risk"

   [**2182-8-26**] Echo: Somewhat small LV cavity with hyperdynamic LV systolic
   function. Dilated and hypokinetic RV. Mild mitral regurgitation.
   There is a mediastinal mass compressing the heart. This mass appears to
   be in the left pleural space. It measures 6 x 4.5 cm approximately and
   has similar echo density to lung tissue. There may be focal areas of
   calcification within the mass. It is impinging on the posterior wall of
   the left atrium but does not seem to be impairing cardiac filling. Mild
   mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-8-23**], the right
   ventricle appears mildly dilated and hypokinetic. There is now a large
   left pleural effusion. There is a mass seen within the effusion which
   was probably there on prior echo but not seen as it was iso-dense with
   the surrounding lung tissue. It can now be delineated because it is now
   surrounded by fluid.
   [**2182-8-26**] Noncontrast CT abd/pelvis:
   Large mass centered within the mediastinum in the chest w/ extension
   into L hilum.  Numerous bulky mediastinal LNs.  Bilateral pleural

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension in the setting of pneumonia and a new diagnosis of cancer metastatic to the liver.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, sepsis, pneumonia, and a mediastinal mass compressing the heart. He has a history of COPD, aspiration precautions, and dysphagia. Other comorbidities include acute renal failure, abnormal liver function tests, hyperlipidemia, chronic back pain, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be multifactorial, including aspiration pneumonia, obstructive pneumonia due to a primary lung cancer, bilateral pleural effusions, and the lung mass itself.
2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis, possibly from aspiration pneumonia, or could also be due to post-obstructive pneumonia from a suspected primary lung cancer, hepatobiliary source, or Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation, and the mediastinal mass may contribute to hemodynamic instability.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has pre-renal azotemia with a BUN/Cr ratio, low urine sodium"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with atypical chest pain, sepsis, and hypotension, and was found to have a new diagnosis of metastatic liver cancer. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments for sepsis, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG surgery, along with the presence of tachycardia and hypotension, suggest a risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels indicate possible liver dysfunction, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy if not managed appropriately.
5. Renal failure: The patient"

 EKG - At [**2182-8-27**] 01:20 AM
   ECHO done to eval EF and source of hypotension--preserved LVEF seen,
   impaired RV function seen and concern for left hilar mass noted.
   CT Chest done--6x8cm left hilar mass with extensive adenopathy seen.
   Left lower lobe collapse noted as well.
   Hypotension--recurrent and persistent across the day/night.  This is
   likely a combination of relative hypovolemia and impaired systemic
   vascular resistance secondary to infection, capillary leak and
   malignancy.  He has moved to the point of requiring pressor support to
   maintain adequate BP.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo admit with new findings of substantial evidence of malignancy
   based on imaging but without tissue diagnosis.  The initial
   presentation of sepsis has hard to define source and he now has
   evolution of worsening hypotension despite fluid resuscitation to the
   point of moderate pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.  In this state
   he has had further cardiovascular compromise to the point of requiring
   pressor support.  In this setting and in light of the Chest CT scan
   findings we have requested input from Oncology to consider if any
   therapeutic intervention for possible diagnoses of malignancy would be
   available.  Given his current functional status chemotherapy would not
   be a reasonable option has been the suggestion with which we would
   concur.  We have updated the family extensively as to the difficult
   situation with clinical compromise which has failed to completely
   resolve with treatment of infection--this may be in part attributable
   to the compromised functional status but does leave him not a candidate
   for chemotherapy Rx and is not medically stable enough to tolerate
   definative biopsy to guide that therapy.  These issues have been
   discussed in detail with the patient and his family.
   1)Sepsis
   -Azithro/Vaco/Zosyn
   -Continue with hydrocortisone
   -Patient will have pressors titrated to MAP >65
   2)Respiratory Failure
   -face mask for O2 delivery
   -Patient will have fluid balance optimized and pressors used for BP
   support
   -Rx for PNA
   -[**Month (only) 8**] move to right side down position given left lower lobe collapse.
   -Pleural effusions are present but unlikely to be causing ventilatory
   compromise
   3)Tachycardia-
   -Heparin restarted with concern for PE
this remains possible but
   certainly alternative causes are present to explain tachycardia
will
   stop infusion if evidence of bleeding is seen.
   -Will look to minimize the B-agonists as possible triggers of the
   tachcardia in the setting of pressor support.
   4)Malignancy
strongly suggeted by imaging.  He has mediatinal mass
   which may be appropriate target for biopsy in general but in his
   current clinical condition is not considered medically stable to
   tolerate procedure.  In addition, should a diagnosis be made he would
   not be able to tolerate chemotherapy which would not be offered given
   his current clinical status.
   5)ICU
Patient with worsening clinical status despite optimal efforts at
   treating reversible causes of his decline.  Have reached a point of
   inability to generate clinical improvement and in fact he has shown
   clinical decline.  Family meeting scheduled for today with the wife
   present to discuss grave prognosis and current goals of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has evidence of malignancy based on imaging but without a tissue diagnosis. The initial presentation of sepsis has a hard-to-define source, and the patient now has worsening hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, leading to moderate pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. 

The patient requires pressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure. The family has been updated on the difficult situation and the clinical compromise that has failed to completely resolve with treatment of infection. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. It can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is also at risk of respiratory failure due to pneumonia (PNA) and left lower lobe collapse. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia, which is an abnormally fast heart rate. This can be caused by various factors, including infection, sepsis, or even pulmonary embolism (PE). 

4. Malignancy: The imaging suggests the presence of malignancy, possibly a mediastinal mass. However, the patient is not considered"
