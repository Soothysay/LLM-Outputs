   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis - Likely upper GI source in setting of
   supra-therapeutic INR, ddx includes PUD, ASA-induced gastritis,
   malignancy.
   - defer EGD for now given cardiac ischemia, hypotension, coagulopathy
   - Hct stable since yesterday, increase to [**Hospital1 **] checks
   - continue PPI gtt for 72 hours
   - f/u GI recs
   - access 2 PIV, a-line, central line
   - hold ASA, coumadin
   - Hepatic injury may be contributing to coagulopathy. Consider vitamin
   K IV as long as HD stable.
   - Did receive FFP this am for coagulopathy and in setting of poor UOP
   for volume resusitation
   # Hypotension- Patient
s exam difficult to interpret and unclear volume
   status but LOS balance positive 6L with poor but stable CO (EF 25%).
   FFP this am for coagulopathy as method of volume repletion but will
   favor holding further IVF because of CHF.
   - Did not tolerate dopamine. Consider levophed and hold further IVF
   given poor EF, goal MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam
   - continue monitoring on tele
   # Acute Renal Failure- Baseline Cre appears to be around 2.0, current
   Cre 3.6. Urine lytes c/w pre-renal azotemia likely from hypotension.
   - augment forward flow with levophed trial and FFP today as above
   - gentle IVF given EF
   - recheck lytes in pm
   # Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure- CPK continues to rise.  TTE yesterday
   reveals stable EF 25%.  Current volume status appeared slightly
   intravascularly depleted (MAP 73, UOP low but also new ARF) awaiting
   FFP.  Dopa trial did not change UOP.
   - trend CK, CPK
   - volume repletion and levophed trial as above to goal MAP >60, UOP >30
   cc/hr
   - monitor on telemetry
   - anticoagulation on hold for now
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver, however biliary process still
   possible.  RUQ u/s equivocal for cholecystitis but exam not consistent
   with acute cholecystitis.
   - Cannot tolerate MRCP given ARF
   - trend LFT's, amylase, lipase

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. The patient was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed while on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's condition is complicated by acute renal failure (ARF), shock liver, and possible demand ischemia/heart failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of coffee ground emesis, which indicates an upper GI source. The bleed is likely due to supra-therapeutic INR, and possible causes include peptic ulcer disease (PUD), aspirin-induced gastritis, or malignancy. Further evaluation, such as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), may be required once the patient's cardiac ischemia, hypotension, and coagulopathy are addressed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, making it difficult to interpret the physical examination findings and unclear volume status. The positive fluid balance suggests that the patient has received significant fluid resuscitation. However, further IV fluids are being held due to concerns of congestive heart failure (CHF). The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and urine output (UOP) above 30 cc/hr.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level appears to be around"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a coffee ground emesis, which suggests an upper GI source. The therapeutic INR indicates that the bleeding could be due to anticoagulation. Differential diagnosis includes peptic ulcer disease (PUD), ASA-induced gastritis, and malignancy.

2. Ischemic heart disease/heart failure: The patient has a history of demand ischemia with a known 25% ejection fraction (EF) and severe hypokinesis. The rising CPK levels indicate ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's current volume status appears slightly intravascularly depleted, and there is evidence of acute renal failure.

3. Pulmonary complications: The patient has an increasing oxygen requirement, and a new retrocardiac opacity on the chest X-ray suggests pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been started on Augmentin for possible aspiration.

4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and clinically somewhat volume depleted. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and urine output (UOP) above 30 cc/hr. Fluid repletion has been given cautiously due to the patient's poor"

   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation.
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis - Likely upper GI source in setting of
   therapeutic INR, ddx includes PUD, ASA-induced gastritis, malignancy.
   - defer EGD for now given cardiac ischemia, hypotension, coagulopathy
   - Hct stable since yesterday, continue q6hr checks
   - continue PPI gtt
   - f/u GI recs
   - access 2 PIV, a-line, central line
   - hold ASA, coumadin
   .
   # Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure- CPK continues to rise.  TTE yesterday
   reveals stable EF 25% with severe hypokinesis.  Current volume status
   appears slightly intravascularly depleted (MAP 73, UOP low but also new
   ARF).
   - trend CK, CPK
   - volume repletion to goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - monitor on telemetry
   - anticoagulation on hold for now
   .
   # Increasing 02 requirement- New retrocardiac opacity suggests PNA.
   CXR does not suggest fluid overload/pulmonary edema
   - started on augmentin for possible aspiration
   - f/u am CXR for signs of pulmonary edema
   .
   # Hypotension- Patient clinically somewhat volume depleted with with
   poor but stable CO (EF 25%).  Has received 500 cc fluid bolus with
   lactate persisting at in low 2
   - Gentle fluids given poor EF, goal MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam
   - continue monitoring on tele
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure- Baseline Cre appears to be around 2.0, current
   Cre 3.1 with K 5.7, no EKG changes.  Likely pre-renal given patient's
   fluid depleted clinical status
   - gentle IVF given EF
   - check UA and urine lytes
   - will hold on kayexelate pending procedure
   - recheck lytes in pm
   .
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver, however biliary process still
   possible.  RUQ u/s equivocal for cholecystitis.
   - consider MRCP today, however Cre continues to rise
   - trend LFT's, amylase, lipase

","The patient is an 88-year-old male who was admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He is now in the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed while on anticoagulation. The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note.

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has coffee ground emesis, which suggests an upper GI source. This could be due to peptic ulcer disease (PUD), aspirin-induced gastritis, or malignancy. The therapeutic INR indicates that the bleeding may be related to anticoagulation.

2. Cardiac ischemia/heart failure: The patient has a history of multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. His troponin levels are elevated, and there is evidence of ischemic changes on the TTE. This indicates ongoing cardiac ischemia and possible heart failure.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has an increasing oxygen requirement and a new retrocardiac opacity on the chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia (PNA). There are no signs of fluid overload or pulmonary edema.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine (Cre) appears to be around 2.0, and it has risen to 3.1 with a potassium level of 5.7. This indicates pre-renal acute renal failure, likely due to poor perfusion and hypov"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). He has been receiving supportive care in the ICU, including fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, and medications to stabilize his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding. The presence of coffee ground emesis suggests an upper GI source. Endoscopy may be required to evaluate for active bleeding and to reverse anticoagulation prior to INR < 2.0.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely due to poor cardiac output (EF 25%) and volume depletion. Gentle fluids should be given to maintain adequate perfusion, and a central line may be necessary to monitor and manage his fluid status.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a rising creatinine level and elevated potassium, indicating acute renal failure. This is likely pre-renal due to the patient's fluid-depleted clinical status. Gentle IV fluids should be given, and further evaluation with urine analysis and electrolyte monitoring is needed.
4. Transaminitis/abdominal pain: The patient has markedly elevated AST and"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient presented with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient received Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to an elevated INR in the setting of GIB.

The patient's oxygen saturation levels decreased, leading to a chest X-ray that showed retrocardiac opacity, which is concerning for pneumonia. The antibiotic Cipro was changed to Augmentin to cover possible aspiration.

The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been relatively stable, ranging from 33.9 to 35.7. Cardiac enzymes such as CK and troponin are still rising. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was suboptimal, showing an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient has rising liver function tests (LFTs), likely due to shock liver. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is being considered instead of a HIDA scan.

The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) was low (<50s) and did not improve with fluid resuscitation. Dopamine was started but stopped due to tachycardia. The arterial line was faulty, but the patient's systemic blood pressure (SBP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on low-dose levaphed to control systolic blood pressure between 120-130 mmHg. The patient's urine output remains marginal at 20-25 cc/hr. Renal recommendations include repeating a urinalysis, electrolytes, and eosinophil count, and administering DDAVP if there is evidence of uremic platelets. A liver consult has been requested for an ERCP consultation and repeat abdominal ultrasound. The preliminary read of the repeat ultrasound shows mildly improved appearance of the gallbladder containing sludge mixed with bile, with mild wall thickening of 3.7 mm. No specific signs of cholecystitis are noted, along with echogenic liver and right pleural effusion. The patient's oxygen requirement has been weaned down overnight and he experienced atrial fibrillation at 5 AM with heart rates reaching 120 bpm and blood pressures in the 100s/60s. The patient was transitioned to Neo. 

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular instability, gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory distress."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He has been transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed while on anticoagulation. The patient's medical history includes acute renal failure (ARF), shock liver, atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple IV lines. His vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and low urine output. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and require urgent endoscopic intervention.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. This can be due to hypotension and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Shock Liver: The patient has evidence of liver dysfunction, which may be related to the recent hypotensive episode. Monitoring of liver function tests is important.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing AF, which may be secondary to the hypotension and stress of the GI bleed. Rate control is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite pressor support, indicating ongoing hemodynamic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the unit due to a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), which developed while on levophed and was terminated without the need for rate control after switching to neo. He also has acute renal failure likely due to hypotension, and his urine output has improved somewhat with pressors. The patient's ejection fraction is stable at 25%. He has transaminitis, likely due to shock liver, and his liver enzymes are improving. The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored, and he is on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. He has multiple lines in place for monitoring and treatment. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient's initial presentation was a new upper GI bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. There is a risk of rebleeding, especially if the source of the bleed is not addressed or if anticoagulation is continued.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure likely due to hypotension. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further deterioration of renal function and potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Coffee ground emesis: Likely upper GI source in setting of
   supra-therapeutic INR, ddx includes PUD, ASA-induced gastritis,
   malignancy.  Hepatic injury may be contributing to coagulopathy with
   INR persistently high.
   - Hct stable since yesterday, decrease to daily checks
   - Defer EGD for now given stable Hct in setting of cardiac ischemia,
   hypotension, coagulopathy
   - Continue PPI gtt for 72 hours, then change to IV bid
   - Access 2 PIV, a-line, central line
   - D/c NGT, advance diet
   - Holding ASA, coumadin
   - Consider DDAVP if further bleed for uremic plt per Renal
   - Give FFP x 2 units
   - F/u GI recs
   # Hypotension:  Cardiogenic v. hypovolemic v. distributive. Was started
   on levophed yesterday but developed afib, switched to neo; afib
   terminated on its own without need to rate control.
   - Will receive volume with FFP; allow po fluid intake but caution in
   setting of EF 25%
   - Hope to be able to wean neo with improvement in fluid status; goal
   MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam,
   CvO2
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Likely in setting of levophed,
   changed to neo.
   - Appreciate cards recs
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cre continues to
   climb.  Urine without eos, + few granular casts.  Urine lytes yesterday
   c/w pre-renal azotemia also likely from hypotension.  UOP improved
   somewhat with pressors.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake today
   - Monitor U/O
   - Wean pressor as tolerated
   # Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure: CPK trending down.  Very elevated BNP
   yesterday. TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Trend CK, CPK daily
   - Recheck BNP
   - Volume repletion and neo as above to goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Anticoagulation on hold for now
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving.  ERCP
   service consulted, however pt not felt likely to tolerate ERCP now and
   RUQ u/s was repeated showing slightly improved picture.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the ICU for evaluation of new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus (DM). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient presented with coffee ground emesis, indicating an upper GI source. The bleeding could be due to peptic ulcer disease (PUD), aspirin-induced gastritis, or malignancy. The patient is currently receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and will be transitioned to intravenous (IV) therapy after 72 hours.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, requiring the use of vasopressors such as levophed and neo to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The cause of hypotension could be cardiogenic, hypovolemic, or distributive in nature. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion. Renal replacement therapy is not necessary at this time, but close monitoring of urine output (UOP) and electrolytes is required. Fluid restriction may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the unit for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed while on anticoagulation. The patient's conditions include hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver. He also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-fib with RVR) and is experiencing ischemic heart disease with demand ischemia and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient's coffee ground emesis suggests an upper GI source. The differential diagnosis includes peptic ulcer disease (PUD), aspirin-induced gastritis, and malignancy. Further evaluation with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be necessary once the patient's cardiac ischemia, hypotension, and coagulopathy are addressed.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level appears to be around 2.0, and his current creatinine level is 3.6. The urine electrolytes indicate pre-renal azotemia likely due to hypotension. Augmenting forward flow with levophed trial and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can help improve renal perfusion. Gentle intravenous fluids (IVF) should be given considering the patient's poor ejection fraction (EF).

3. Atrial fibrillation with"

   Cardiogenic v. hypovolemic v. distributive, with hypovolemic most
   likely. Was started on levophed intially but developed afib.  Pressors
   off since  this morning.  ABG early this morning with gap metabolic
   acidosis further supports hypoperfused state.
   - Will receive volume with FFP; allow po fluid intake but caution in
   setting of EF 25%
   - Hope to maintain pressors off; goal MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - If requires pressors, would choose neo
   - Follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam,
   CvO2
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - Set 5 day course of Unasyn (to end on [**2102-6-24**])
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Likely in setting of levophed,
   changed to neo. Continues to have runs of afib.  Lopressor x1 yesterday
   did not persistently slow rate.  Cardiology recommended digoxin
   loading.
   - Continue dig loading with renal dosing
   - Appreciate cards following
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - if his HR increases, will try lopressor and neo if he requires
   pressors.
   # Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure: CPK trending down.  BNP increased from
   40K -> 70K. TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Gentle volume repletion, dig and possible neo as above to goal MAP
   >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving, Tbili
   stable.  Started on ursadiol for possible biliary process.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Started sarna for itching
   - Lactulose for ? encephalopathy
   # Altered mental status: unclear cause, may be delirium from
   encephalopathy, uremia, hemodynamics
   - cte to treat a-fib and ARF as indicated
   - give dose of lactulose
   - consider Haldol if QTc okay
   - minimizes lines/drains.
   # Coffee ground emesis: Likely upper GI source in setting of
   supra-therapeutic INR.  Hepatic injury may be contributing to
   coagulopathy with INR persistently high, now improved with 2 u FFP.
   PPI changed to [**Hospital1 **].  Tolerated a diet.
   - Hct stable since yesterday, decrease to [**Hospital1 **] checks
   - Defer EGD for now given stable Hct in setting of cardiac ischemia,
   hypotension, coagulopathy
   - Access 2 PIV, a-line, central line
   - Consider DDAVP if further bleed for uremic plt per Renal
   - F/u GI recs
   - no anticoagulation
   - f/u INR
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cr appears to have
   stabilized.  UOP improved somewhat over last 24 hours.  Started bicarb
   yesterday per renal recs.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - f/u renal recs
   - Monitor UOP and Cr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the unit for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) and shock liver.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient initially required vasopressor support with levophed due to hypotension. However, he has been weaned off the pressors and is showing improvement. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and urine output (UOP) above 30 cc/hr.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient developed AF likely secondary to levophed use. He was switched to neosynephrine (neo) and continues to have runs of AF. Digoxin loading has been initiated, and the patient's heart rate will be monitored closely.

3. Cardiogenic Shock/Heart Failure: The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease, and there is concern for demand ischemia or heart failure. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have increased, indicating worsening heart failure. The treatment plan includes gentle volume repletion, digoxin, and possibly neo to achieve a goal MAP >60 and UOP >30 cc/hr.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is improving, but there is a risk of recurrent hypotension due to ongoing cardiac ischemia, hypovolemia, and potential distributive shock. Close monitoring of perfusion status and MAP should be done. Pressors may be necessary if needed.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has episodes of AF, which may be related to levophed use. Digoxin loading is recommended to control the heart rate, and close monitoring of ECG and telemetry is required.
3. Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure with a stable ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. Gentle volume repletion, digoxin, and possible neo as above to achieve a goal MAP >60 and UOP >30 cc/hr should be considered.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has evidence of shock liver with transaminitis improving. Ursodiol has been started for a possible biliary process. Follow-up liver recommendations and trend LFTs, amylase, and lipase.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Hypotension:  Appears to be improving with CvO2 high 60
s-low 70
   Cardiogenic v. hypovolemic v. distributive, with hypovolemic most
   likely. Was started on levophed intially but developed afib, switched
   to neo; afib terminated on its own without need to rate control.
   Pressors off since  this morning.  ABG early this morning with gap
   metabolic acidosis further supports hypoperfused state.
   - Will receive volume with FFP; allow po fluid intake but caution in
   setting of EF 25%
   - Hope to maintain pressors off; goal MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - If requires pressors, would choose neo
   - Follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam,
   CvO2
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Likely in setting of levophed,
   changed to neo. Continues to have runs of afib.  Lopressor x1 yesterday
   did not persistently slow rate.
   - Continue dig loading with renal dosing
   - Appreciate cards following
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   # Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure: CPK trending down.  BNP increased from
   40K -> 70K. TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Gentle volume repletion, dig and possible neo as above to goal MAP
   >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving, Tbili
   stable.  Started on ursadiol for possible biliary process.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Coffee ground emesis: Likely upper GI source in setting of
   supra-therapeutic INR.  Hepatic injury may be contributing to
   coagulopathy with INR persistently high, now improved with 2 u FFP.
   PPI changed to [**Hospital1 **].  Tolerated a diet.
   - Hct stable since yesterday, decrease to daily checks
   - Defer EGD for now given stable Hct in setting of cardiac ischemia,
   hypotension, coagulopathy
   - Access 2 PIV, a-line, central line
   - Consider DDAVP if further bleed for uremic plt per Renal
   - F/u GI recs
   - no anticoagulation
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cre appears to have
   stabilized.  UOP improved somewhat over last 24 hours.  Started bicarb
   yesterday per renal recs.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - f/u renal recs
   - Monitor UOP and Cre
   #DM
   - Hold glyburide while inpatient

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is an elderly male with a history of abdominal pain and hypotension. He was admitted for evaluation of new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver.

2. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5%), heart rate of 104 bpm (75-124 bpm), blood pressure of 123/69 mmHg (87-138/74 mmHg), respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (17-34 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

3. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has been started on digoxin with renal dosing. There are occasional bursts of tachycardia, and the patient is still on neo pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and urine output (UOP) above 30 cc/hr.

4. The patient has metabolic acidosis with an ABG showing pH 7.37, HCO3- 25 mmol/L, and base excess -8. Lactic acid levels are elevated at 1.5 mmol/L. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He has been transferred to the ICU for evaluation of new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, transaminitis, coffee ground emesis, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. The patient is on various medications including digoxin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and proton pump inhibitors. He is also receiving fluid resuscitation and blood products.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which could lead to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction. Close monitoring of blood pressure and perfusion status is necessary.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which may contribute to inadequate cardiac output and further hypotension. Rate control measures should be implemented.
3. Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient has evidence of demand ischemia and heart failure, as indicated by elevated cardiac enzymes and B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Continued monitoring of cardiac status and optimization of cardiac function are important.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, likely due to shock liver. Close monitoring of liver function tests and appropriate management of the underlying"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) and shock liver.

The patient's current assessment includes hypotension, atrial fibrillation (AF), demand ischemia/heart failure, transaminitis, coffee ground emesis, and ARF. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, with possible causes including cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and distributive shock. The patient is receiving vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion. Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output is essential.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed AF, which may be related to the use of levophed, a vasopressor. The patient's heart rhythm should be continuously monitored, and rate control measures may be necessary.

3. Demand Ischemia/Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of demand ischemia and heart failure, as indicated by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 25% on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Monitoring the patient's cardiac enzymes,"

The patient's cardiac status is monitored with electrocardiography (ECG) and telemetry.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and liver enzymes, as well as elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), lactate, lipase, and troponin-T. The patient's prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated, indicating a coagulopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Hypotension:  Likely hypovolemic etiology due to poor forward flow vs
   volume depletion; appears to be improving now that patient has
   converted to sinus.  Pressors briefly restarted overnight for
   tachycardia with systolic BP
s in the 90
s, currently being weaned.
   Transaminitis and UOP improving, suggesting improved perfusion state.
   - wean neo as tolerated; goal MAP >60 and UOP> 30 cc/hr
   - If requires pressors, would continue with neo
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, LFT
s, INR, mentation, skin exam,
   CvO2
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - Set 5 day course of Unasyn (to end on [**2102-6-24**]) for possible septic
   source
   - PT consult
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading; current dig level 1.3.
   - Continue dig
   - Appreciate cards following
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - if his HR increases, will try lopressor and neo if he requires
   pressors, as above
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP continues to be elevated at >70K, however
   hemodynamics improved and recent TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Gentle volume repletion, dig and possible neo as above to goal MAP
   >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving, Tbili
   stable.  Started on ursadiol and sarna for itching.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Started sarna for itching
   - Lactulose for ? encephalopathy, titrate to 1 BM/day
   # Altered mental status: unclear cause, may be delirium from
   encephalopathy, uremia, hemodynamics; appears improved this am
   - cte to treat a-fib and ARF as indicated
   - lactulose as above
   - consider Haldol if QTc okay
   - minimizes lines/drains.
   # Coffee ground emesis: Likely upper GI source in setting of
   supra-therapeutic INR.  BM yesterday was maroon but not evidence of
   fresh blood.  Hepatic injury may be contributing to coagulopathy with
   INR persistently high, now improving.  PPI changed to [**Hospital1 **].  Tolerated a
   diet.
   - Hct stable since yesterday, [**Hospital1 **] checks
   - Defer EGD for now given stable Hct in setting of cardiac ischemia,
   hypotension, coagulopathy
   - Access = a-line, picc
   - Advance diet to full liquids
   - Consider DDAVP if further bleed for uremic plt per Renal
   - F/u GI recs
   - no anticoagulation
   - f/u INR
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cr 4.0 down from
   4.8.  UOP improved somewhat over last 24 hours.  Started bicarb
   yesterday per renal recs.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake

   - Check Hct Q6H
   - Transfuse for Hct <30
   - Cls GI re: possibility of scope
   - PPI IV BID until source found as more likely LGIB but as came in with
   coffee ground emesis could be brisk UGIB
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP continues to be elevated at >70K, however
   hemodynamics improved and recent TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Gentle volume repletion, dig and possible neo as above to goal MAP
   >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - consider D/C bicarb as large salt load
   - Cte dig as above
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cr 4.0 down from
   4.8.  UOP improved somewhat over last 24 hours.  Started bicarb
   yesterday per renal recs but will likely not continue for long given
   large sodium load with it.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake

He has been transferred to the ICU for evaluation of new upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 127/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and is currently on phenylephrine infusion for blood pressure support. His urine output has improved over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and liver enzymes. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results show abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and cardiac markers.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure improves when in normal sinus rhythm but worsens with bouts of AFib/RVR, leading to the need for vasopressor support. Maroon-colored stools suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, although the patient's hem"

   - PPI IV BID ->change to PO today
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP continues to be elevated at >70K, however
   hemodynamics improved and recent TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Gentle volume repletion, dig and beta blocker
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - consider d/c bicarb when renal function improves as high salt load
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cr 4.0 down from
   4.8.  UOP improved somewhat over last 24 hours.  Started bicarb
   yesterday per renal recs but will likely not continue for long given
   large sodium load with it.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - f/u renal recs
   - Monitor UOP and Cr
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving, Tbili
   stable.  Started on ursadiol and sarna for itching.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Started sarna for itching
   - Consider ERCP in future if TBili does not resolve
   # AMS: Now resolved. Consider PT and OOB to chair today after IVF so
   less likely to have hypotension.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He has been evaluated for a new upper gastrointestinal bleed while on anticoagulation, complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure, and shock liver. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and possible lower gastrointestinal bleed. He has stable hematocrit levels. The patient is also experiencing acute on chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: This irregular and fast heart rhythm can result in decreased cardiac output, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion.
3. Possible Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed: The presence of maroon-colored stools suggests bleeding in the lower gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, which can progress to complete renal failure if not managed appropriately.
5. Shock Liver: The patient's transaminitis (elevated liver enzymes) and stable bilirubin levels suggest liver dysfunction, possibly due to hypoperfusion.
6. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure: The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Hypotension:  Improves when in NSR but ctes to have bouts of AF with
   RVR precipitating hypotension and necessitating neo. Now with maroon
   colored stools concerning for [**Year (4 digits) **] although Hct stable.  Transaminitis
   and UOP improving, suggesting improved perfusion state.
   - Rx AF as below
   - wean neo as tolerated; goal MAP >60 and UOP> 30 cc/hr
   - If requires pressors, would continue with neo
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, LFT
s, INR, mentation, skin exam,
   CvO2
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading; current dig level 1.3.
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Appreciate cards following
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - if his HR increases, will try lopressor and neo if he requires
   pressors, as above
   - No anticoagulation given [**Year (4 digits) **]
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   # [**Year (4 digits) **]: Admitted with coffee ground emesis but now with maroon colored
   stools suggesting lower [**Year (4 digits) **]. Hcts stable.
   - Check Hct Q6H
   - Transfuse for Hct <30
   - Cls GI re: possibility of scope
   - PPI IV BID until source found as more likely LGIB but as came in with
   coffee ground emesis could be brisk UGIB
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP continues to be elevated at >70K, however
   hemodynamics improved and recent TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Gentle volume repletion, dig and possible neo as above to goal MAP
   >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - consider D/C bicarb as large salt load

   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cr 4.0 down from
   4.8.  UOP improved somewhat over last 24 hours.  Started bicarb
   yesterday per renal recs but will likely not continue for long given
   large sodium load with it.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - f/u renal recs
   - Monitor UOP and Cr
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving, Tbili
   stable.  Started on ursadiol and sarna for itching.

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed while on anticoagulation.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), acute renal failure, and chronic heart failure.
- The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, possibly due to AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy.
- The patient's condition has improved, with improved perfusion state indicated by increased urine output (UOP) and transaminitis.
- The patient has maroon-colored stools, suggesting lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.
- The patient has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicating acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient's renal function is compromised, with acute renal failure likely due to hypotension.
- The patient has transaminitis, likely secondary to shock liver.
- The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Further deterioration in renal function leading to renal failure.
2. Worsening of heart failure symptoms, such as pulmonary edema or worsening dyspnea.
3. Development of sepsis due to the presence of an indwelling arterial line or other lines.
4. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to anemia or hemodynamic instability.
5. Development of hepatic encephalopathy due to the underlying liver dysfunction.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility.
8. Further deterioration in mental status due to multiorgan dysfunction or sepsis."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with unknown weight and age, admitted to the ICU due to multiple health issues. The patient has a history of altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, and myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 54/44 mmHg to 128/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 93%, and irregular heart rhythm. The patient's lab results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes, and cardiac enzymes. The patient has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, digoxin, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, progression of liver dysfunction, development of further gastrointestinal bleeding, worsening of hypoxemia, and potential cardiac complications due to ongoing myocardial infarction. Additionally, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. The patient's altered mental status may also indicate a risk of delirium or further cognitive decline. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been admitted to the ICU, where they are currently receiving various medications and treatments. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 106/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's condition includes altered mental status, hypoxemia, myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, and other complications. The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, troponin-T, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may require further intervention to maintain adequate blood flow and organ perfusion.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: Despite being stable initially, the patient has started passing maroon stools, suggesting a possible re-bleeding event. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further bleeding and stabilize the patient's condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. Prompt intervention to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and a slightly low respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is within normal range. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and coronary artery disease. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is low, indicating poor tissue perfusion. The patient's fluid balance shows an ongoing loss of fluids. The patient's blood product usage is significant, with a total output of 1,215 mL. The patient's urine output is also low at 415 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient has abnormal liver function tests and elevated levels of cardiac enzymes. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest acute kidney injury.
2. Hepatic Dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests indicate possible hepatic dysfunction.
3. Myocardial Infarction: The elevated levels of cardiac enzymes suggest myocardial injury.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient's use of mechanical ventilation and low"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the
   unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of anticoagulation
   complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Hypotension:  Off pressors since 3am on [**6-24**]. Had another episode of
   AF with RVR overnight but did not develop hypotension. Able to maintain
   BP while sitting up this AM, an improvement from yesterday.
   Transaminitis and UOP improving with nl lactate, suggesting improved
   perfusion state. Did have maroon colored stools on [**6-23**] concerning for
   GIB but Hct stable.
   - Treat AF as below with dig, beta blocker
   - If requires pressors, would resume neo
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, CvO2, lactate, liver function,
   mentation
   - Would give IVF cautiously if requires given CHF
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading; current dig level 1.4.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - If his HR increases, will try lopressor and neo if he requires
   pressors as above
   - No anticoagulation given GIB
   - F/u cards recs
   # Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile. Source unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1384**] U/A, Ucx, stool for C. diff.
   - Consider CXR if spikes (occasional cough [**Name8 (MD) 24**] RN)
   # GIB: Admitted with coffee ground emesis but had maroon colored stools
   2 days ago suggesting lower GIB. Hcts stable.
   - Check Hct daily
   - Transfuse for Hct <30
   - PPI IV BID ->change to PO today
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP continues to be elevated at >70K, however
   hemodynamics improved and recent TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Cont dig and beta blocker; conservation IV fluids if needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider d/c bicarb when renal function improves as high salt load
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs.
   Cr curve flattening at 4.8, has some U/O.
   - Cont bicarb for now per renal recs
   - Monitor UOP and Cr
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - F/u renal recs
   # Transaminitis: Evaluated by Liver and thought likely shock liver with
   transaminitis improving although Tbili still rising; may lag. [**6-20**] abd
   U/S with mildly improved gallbladder appearance with sludge and mild
   wall thickening; no specific cholecystitis signs or biliary dilatation.
    Started on ursodiol and sarna for itching.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Started sarna/ursodiol for itching; could consider cholestyramine
   - F/u liver recs; will ask Liver if Tbili elevation out of proportion
   to expectation with shock liver; consider ERCP in future if TBili does
   not resolve
   # Thyroid: Question of central hypothyroidism with low TSH and T4.
   - Checking free T4
   # AMS: Confusion at night with nonfocal neuro exam. [**Month (only) 11**] have element of
   sundowning. Could also represent delirium in setting, ? underlying
   infection given rise in leukocytosis although afebrile
   - Leukocytosis w/u as above
   - OOB to chair
   - Could consider low-dose antipsychotics if very agitated but no need
   for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of new upper gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure, and shock liver. The patient has been off pressors since 3am on 6-24. He had another episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response overnight but did not develop hypotension. The patient is able to maintain blood pressure while sitting up this morning, which is an improvement from yesterday. Transaminitis and urine output are improving, with normal lactate levels suggesting improved perfusion state. The patient had maroon-colored stools on 6-23, which is concerning for gastrointestinal bleeding but hemoglobin concentration is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced multiple episodes of hypotension, which can lead to organ perfusion failure and potentially worsen renal function.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary to assess renal function.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had maroon-colored stools, suggesting lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemoglobin levels should be monitored regularly, and transfusion may be required if the hemoglobin drops below 30.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had episodes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal bleed while on anticoagulation. The patient has experienced complications such as hypotension, acute renal failure, shock liver, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have episodes of hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's maroon-colored stools suggest ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleeding. If not managed promptly, this can lead to significant blood loss, hypotension, and potential shock.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and supraventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias can cause hemodynamic instability and increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest transaminitis, which may be secondary to shock liver. This condition should be monitored closely, as it can progress to acute liver failure.
6. Thyroid Abnormalities: The patient has low TSH and T4 levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. The patient has been evaluated for a new upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and it improves when in normal sinus rhythm but worsens with atrial fibrillation and resulting in reduced venous return (RVR), which necessitates the use of neo (presumably a medication).

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has been treated with digoxin to control the heart rate. The current digoxin level is 1.3, which is within therapeutic range.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient initially presented with coffee ground emesis but now has maroon-colored stools, indicating lower GIB. Hct (hematocrit) levels are stable, and further investigations are planned.

4. Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicating ongoing cardiac stress. However, recent echocardiography shows stable left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%. Management includes gentle volume repletion, digoxin, and beta-blocker therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension,
   transferred to the unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of
   anticoagulation complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Hypotension:  Improves when in NSR but ctes to have bouts of AF with
   RVR precipitating hypotension and necessitating neo. Now with maroon
   colored stools concerning for GIB although Hct stable.  Transaminitis
   and UOP improving, suggesting improved perfusion state.
   - Rx AF as below with dig
   - If requires pressors, would continue with neo
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, LFT
s, INR, mentation, skin exam,
   CvO2
   - increase diet today and consider IVF cautiously given CHF if
   requires.
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading; current dig level 1.3.
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Appreciate cards following
   - Started metoprolol for rate control with stable pressures
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - if his HR increases, will try lopressor and neo if he requires
   pressors, as above
   - No anticoagulation given GIB
   # GIB: Admitted with coffee ground emesis but now with maroon colored
   stools suggesting lower GIB. Hcts stable.
   - Check Hct QD
   - Transfuse for Hct <30
   - PPI IV BID ->change to PO today
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP continues to be elevated at >70K, however
   hemodynamics improved and recent TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Gentle volume repletion, dig and beta blocker
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - consider d/c bicarb when renal function improves as high salt load
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs, no
   need for renal replacement therapy at this time.  Cr 4.0 down from
   4.8.  UOP improved somewhat over last 24 hours.  Startedbicarb
   yesterday per renal recs but will likely not continue for long given
   large sodium load with it.
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - f/u renal recs
   - Monitor UOP and Cr
   # Transaminitis- Likely shock liver with transaminitis improving, Tbili
   stable.  Started on ursadiol and sarna for itching.
   - F/u Liver recs
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Started sarna for itching
   - Consider ERCP in future if TBili does not resolve
   # AMS: Now resolved. Consider PT and OOB to chair today after IVF so
   less likely to have hypotension.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the unit due to a new upper gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by acute renal failure, shock liver, and hypotension. The patient's conditions include hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute on chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension continues to be a concern and can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AF with RVR): The patient's AF with RVR may result in decreased cardiac output, increased risk of thromboembolic events, and the need for rate control medications.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's GIB can cause significant blood loss leading to anemia, hypotension, and potential organ dysfunction.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased risk of infections.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis, likely due to shock liver, should be monitored for progression to liver dysfunction and potential complications such as coagul"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male who was admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He has been transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal bleed while on anticoagulation. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension, and is showing signs of shock liver with transaminitis. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has been managed with digoxin. The patient also has chronic heart failure with a stable ejection fraction of 25% and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from the lower gastrointestinal tract. His thyroid function tests show low levels of TSH and T4, indicating possible central hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have episodes of hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potentially worsen renal function or cause further gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. If not managed properly, this could progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's maroon-colored stools suggest ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleeding. If not controlled, this could lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation, which could lead to stroke or other thromboembolic events if not appropriately managed with"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation (AF), altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute renal failure (ARF), liver function abnormalities, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been on various medications including ampicillin/sulbactam, digoxin, and a beta-blocker. The patient's vital signs have been unstable with fluctuating blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Fluid balance has been monitored, with a net positive balance of 1,308 mL since midnight. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and the need for supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite treatment with digoxin and other interventions poses a potential complication. Continuous monitoring and further management are required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent episode of passing maroon stools indicates ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters such as hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary to assess the severity of bleeding and provide appropriate intervention.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and urine output"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has recently experienced a myocardial infarction (heart attack). They are also showing signs of acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are hypoxic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is still hypotensive when standing or out of bed despite being on digoxin.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had been stable but started passing maroon stools yesterday. Hemostatic therapy (HCT, PPI) should be continued.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's condition is critical, and they require continued supportive care including beta-blocker therapy.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but they are still producing less urine while in a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) state. Measures should be taken to avoid hemodialysis as hemodynamics are optimized.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status remains altered, and they require close monitoring and management.
6. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, likely due to hypoxemia.
7. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, indicating potential liver dysfunction.
8. Code status: The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status, indicating"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/56 to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient is receiving various medications, including a beta-blocker and digoxin.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, liver enzymes, amylase, lipase, lactic acid, and cardiac markers.
- The patient has a blood glucose level of 101 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.5 g/dL.
- The patient's physical examination reveals extreme dry oral mucosa, icterus, distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, minimal edema, and confusion.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,128 mL total fluids, including 367 mL of parenteral fluids, 970 mL of oral intake, and 1,158 mL of intravenous fluids.
- The patient's urine output has been 820 mL, and blood product transfusions have been given totaling 450 mL.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 29, PaO2 of 110, HCO3- of 17, and base excess of -7.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows fair air movement.
- The patient has been on a ventilator since [**2102-6-23**] 11:49 AM.
- The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) but is okay to intubate.
- The patient's disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest the possibility of ARF. This can be a consequence of hypoperfusion due to intermittent atrial fibrillation and reduced cardiac output.
2. Liver injury: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and rising bilirubin levels indicate liver injury, which may be related to shock and reduced perfusion.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's passage of maroon stools indicates GIB, which needs to be managed promptly to prevent further blood loss and potential complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia, cardiogenic shock, or septic shock. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid res"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR), hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute renal failure (ARF), liver function abnormalities, and upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's condition has been managed with various medications and interventions. The main concerns currently are the patient's hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, ARF, liver injury, and continued support for the AMI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable but there is a risk of recurrent hypotension due to ongoing issues with cardiac function and potential sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the bleeding has stabilized, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration or progression to chronic renal failure if not properly managed.
4. Liver Injury: The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are elevated, indicating potential liver damage. There is a risk of worsening liver function and possible development of liver failure.
5. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient is still recovering from the AMI, and there is a risk of complications such as heart failure, arrhythm"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He has been evaluated for a new upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. The patient's medical history includes acute renal failure (ARF), shock liver, atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and transaminitis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, maroon-colored stools suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), leukocytosis, and confusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has maroon-colored stools, which indicate possible lower gastrointestinal bleeding. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status and Hct levels. Daily Hct checks should be done, and transfusion for Hct <30 should be considered.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and he has some urine output. Close monitoring of UOP and Cr is necessary. Liberalizing PO fluid intake and following renal recommendations are important. Discussing initiating hemodialysis (HD) with the patient and family is also recommended.

3. Shock liver: The patient has transaminitis improving, but his total bilirubin is still rising. It may lag behind the improvement in transaminase levels. Continuing to trend LFTs, amylase, and lipase is important. Consider ER"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. The patient has been evaluated for a new upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and shock liver.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/65 mmHg to 124/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm has been mostly in sinus rhythm but had one episode of atrial fibrillation (AF) at 2 am.

The patient has been treated with digoxin, beta-blocker, and cautious IV fluid administration due to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's ECG, blood glucose levels, and electrolytes have been monitored. The patient's leukocytosis is unclear in origin, and further investigations are planned. The patient has also shown signs of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), with maroon-colored stools on June 23rd. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has remained stable.

The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels continue to be elevated, indicating ongoing CHF, although hemodynamics have improved. The patient's left ventricular e"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred to the unit due to a new upper gastrointestinal bleed while on anticoagulation. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, acute renal failure, shock liver, atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleed, acute on chronic congestive heart failure, and transaminitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to maintain, and he experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating declining renal function. It is necessary to monitor urine output and continue conservative measures. Discussing the initiation of hemodialysis with the patient and family is also important.
3. Shock Liver: The patient has transaminitis that is improving, but his total bilirubin level is still rising. Close monitoring of liver function tests and further evaluation with imaging studies may be needed.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been mostly in sinus rhythm, but there have been episodes of atrial fibrillation. Continuing with digoxin and beta-blocker therapy, monitoring the electrocardiogram, and following digoxin levels are crucial.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute renal failure (ARF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving supportive care.

24-hour events include the removal of an arterial line and a urine culture. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/58 mmHg to 124/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time but is somnolent and confused when awake. Physical examination reveals dry oral mucosa, orogastric tube in place, poor air movement in the chest, trace edema in the extremities, and no abdominal pain.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Plan:
1. Leukocytosis: pan culturing, rule out C. diff., follow up urine culture.
2. Mental status: likely a combination of uremia, hyperbilirubinemia, and ICU delir"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has an elevated serum creatinine level and a decreased urine output, indicating renal dysfunction.

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, which may suggest heart failure.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a need for close monitoring and management.

4. Myocardial infarction (MI): The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin-T) and a history of chest pain, suggesting an acute myocardial infarction.

5. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT, AST) are significantly elevated, indicating possible liver injury or dysfunction.

6. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has melena (black, tarry stools) and a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

7. Altered mental status: The patient is somnolent and confused when awake but follows commands, suggesting a change in mental status that may be due to various factors such as uremia, hyperbilirubinemia, or ICU delirium.

These are the potential medical complications identified based on the provided information. It is important to note that further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be required to"

   - No anticoagulation given GIB
   - F/u cards recs
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs.
   Cr continues to climb (4.8 ->5.1), has some U/O.
   - Cont bicarb for now per renal recs
   - Monitor UOP and Cr
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - F/u renal recs
   - Discuss initiating HD with pt and family
   # Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile. Source unclear. UA with small leuk, 8 wbc,
   few bacteria
   - f/u Ucx, CXR, stool for C. diff.
   - d/c foley
   # GIB: Admitted with coffee ground emesis but had maroon colored stools
   2 days ago suggesting lower GIB. Hcts stable and has not stooled
   since.
   - continue PO PPI
   - start bowel regimen with colace/senna
   - Check Hct daily
   - Transfuse for Hct <30
   # Transaminitis: Evaluated by Liver and thought likely shock liver with
   transaminitis improving, however Tbili still rising; may lag. [**6-20**] abd
   U/S with mildly improved gallbladder appearance with sludge and mild
   wall thickening; no specific cholecystitis signs or biliary dilatation.
   Started on ursodiol and sarna for itching, could consider
   cholestyramine.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - fractionate Bili
   - consider repeat RUQ U/S
   - [**Month (only) 11**] tolerate MRCP now
   - F/u liver recs; consider ERCP in future if TBili does not resolve
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP continues to be elevated at >70K, however
   hemodynamics improved and recent TTE showed stable EF 25%.
   - Cont dig and beta blocker; conservation IV fluids if needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider d/c bicarb when renal function improves as high salt load
   # Hypotension:  Off pressors for >24 hrs. Appears to have been in sinus
   for most of past 24 hours with one episode of afib at 2am.  Had SBP

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension. He has been evaluated for a new upper gastrointestinal bleed while on anticoagulation, complicated by acute renal failure, shock liver, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's current conditions include acute renal failure likely due to hypotension, leukocytosis with unclear source, gastrointestinal bleed, transaminitis, acute on chronic congestive heart failure, and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating a decline in kidney function. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has maroon-colored stools, suggesting ongoing bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to anemia, hypotension, and potential sepsis.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate treatment.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating liver dysfunction. This could be due to shock liver or other underlying causes. Monitoring liver function and treating any identified causes are essential.
5. Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of acute worsening of chronic congestive heart failure."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the ICU for evaluation of new upper gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, acute renal failure, transaminitis, leukocytosis, anemia, and acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's mental status has significantly worsened this morning, and he has a history of confusion at night with non-focal neuro exam. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia or cardiogenic causes. Pressors have been restarted to maintain blood pressure. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ATN): The patient likely has ATN secondary to hypotension. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) has been initiated. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be managed appropriately.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting transaminitis. This could be attributed to shock liver or other underlying causes. Liver function tests should be trended, and the patient's bilirubin levels should be closely monitored.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the
   unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of anticoagulation
   complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Hypotension:  Concerning for hypovolemic etiology in setting of new
   Hct drop and fluid shifts in CVVH, also concerning for cardiogenic in
   this patient with acute on chronic CHF.  Pressors restarted early this
   am. Mostly in sinus for most of past 24 hours.  Transaminitis and
   lactate stabilizing, suggesting improved perfusion state however mental
   status significantly worse this am.
   - Treat AF as below with dig, beta blocker
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, CvO2, lactate, liver function,
   mentation
   - Would give IVF cautiously if requires given CHF
   - Check repeat am Hct, transfuse for if continues to drop
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading.
   - Rate control with metoprolol
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Discussed with pharmacy.  Keep same dig dose on CVVH.
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - No anticoagulation given GIB, unstable Hct
   - F/u cards recs
   #Anemia: Admitted with coffee ground emesis; had maroon colored stools
   3 days ago and 2 bowel tarry bowel movements yesterday.  Now with new
   Hct drop.
   - continue PO PPI
   - start bowel regimen with colace/senna
   - Repeat check Hct this am, transfuse for Hct <30
   - Will repeat the Hct later today.
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs,
   started CVVH yesterday.  Bicarb d/c
ed now that on CVVH.  [**Month (only) 11**] need HD
   once more hemodynamically stable.
   - Monitor lytes
   - Monitor mental status
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - F/u renal recs
   # Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile. Source unclear. UA with small leuk, 8 wbc,
   few bacteria
   - f/u Ucx, CXR, stool for C. diff.
   - CXR tomorrow morning.
   - d/c foley.
   - Continue to watch pt.
   # Transaminitis: Evaluated by Liver and thought likely shock liver with
   transaminitis improving, however Tbili still rising; may lag.  Bili
   mostly direct (19 direct, 22.5 total).   [**6-20**] abd U/S with no specific
   cholecystitis signs or biliary dilatation. Started on ursodiol and
   sarna for itching, could consider cholestyramine.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Per liver recs, will continue trending Tbili for next 48 hours, if no
   improvement will consider repeat RUQ u/s
   - MRCP/ERCP on hold pending increased patient stability
   - F/u liver recs
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP very elevated at >70K
   - Cont dig and beta blocker; conservation IV fluids if needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider d/c bicarb when renal function improves as high salt load
   # AMS: Confusion at night with non-focal neuro exam. [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of sundowning + contribution from persistently elevated BUN. Could also
   represent delirium in setting, ? underlying infection given rise in
   leukocytosis although afebrile.
   - Continue leukocytosis w/u as above
   - CVVH as above
   - Could consider low-dose antipsychotics if very agitated but no need
   for now

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension, with subsequent evaluation for new upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, acute renal failure, shock liver, and acute on chronic congestive heart failure. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to a hypovolemic etiology, possibly related to ongoing bleeding or fluid shifts during continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). There is also concern for cardiogenic hypotension, given the patient's history of acute on chronic congestive heart failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. CVVH was started yesterday, and bicarbonate dialysis will be considered once the patient is hemodynamically stable.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is likely due to shock liver. However, the total bilirubin levels are still rising, and it will be monitored for the next 48 hours. If there is no improvement, a repeat abdominal ultrasound will be considered.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by coffee ground emesis, maroon-colored stools, and tarry bowel movements. The Hct drop should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypotension. The patient is currently on various medications and treatments such as dialysis, CRRT, and CVVH. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show some fluctuations. The patient's blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine, liver enzymes, and lactate. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to the presence of multiple lines, tubes, and potential source of infection such as gastrointestinal bleed.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction, there is a possibility of developing cardiogenic shock if the heart function deteriorates.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function abnormalities may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause further alterations in mental status.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and potential fluid overload may predispose him to ARDS, leading to worsening respiratory function.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the
   unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of anticoagulation
   complicated by hypotension, ARF, and shock liver.
   # Hypotension:  Concerning for hypovolemic etiology in setting of new
   Hct drop and fluid shifts in CVVH, also concerning for cardiogenic in
   this patient with acute on chronic CHF.  Pressors restarted early this
   am. Mostly in sinus for most of past 24 hours.  Transaminitis and
   lactate stabilizing, suggesting improved perfusion state however mental
   status significantly worse this am.  CXR with increased opacities at
   bases bilaterally, possible pleural effusions.
   - Treat AF as below with dig, beta blocker
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, CvO2, lactate, liver function,
   mentation
   - Would give IVF cautiously if requires given CHF
   - Check repeat am Hct, transfuse if continues to drop
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading.
   - Rate control with metoprolol
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Discussed with pharmacy.  Will switch to daily digoxin dosing given
   dig level today.
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - No anticoagulation given GIB, unstable Hct
   - F/u cards recs
   #Anemia: Admitted with coffee ground emesis; had maroon colored stools
   3 days ago and 2 bowel tarry bowel movements yesterday.  Now with new
   Hct drop.
   - continue PO PPI
   - start bowel regimen with colace/senna
   - Repeat check Hct this am, transfuse for Hct <30
   - Will repeat the Hct later today.
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs,
   started CVVH yesterday.  Bicarb d/c
ed now that on CVVH.  [**Month (only) 11**] need HD
   once more hemodynamically stable.
   - Monitor lytes
   - Monitor mental status
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - F/u renal recs
   # Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile. Source unclear. UA with small leuk, 8 wbc,
   few bacteria
   - f/u Ucx, CXR, stool for C. diff.
   - CXR tomorrow morning.
   - d/c foley.
   - Continue to watch pt.
   # Transaminitis: Evaluated by Liver and thought likely shock liver with
   transaminitis improving, however Tbili still rising; may lag.  Bili
   mostly direct (19 direct, 22.5 total).   [**6-20**] abd U/S with no specific
   cholecystitis signs or biliary dilatation. Started on ursodiol and
   sarna for itching, could consider cholestyramine.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Per liver recs, will continue trending Tbili for next 48 hours, if no
   improvement will consider repeat RUQ u/s
   - MRCP/ERCP on hold pending increased patient stability
   - F/u liver recs
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP very elevated at >70K
   - Cont dig and beta blocker; conservation IV fluids if needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider d/c bicarb when renal function improves as high salt load
   # AMS: Confusion at night with non-focal neuro exam. [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of sundowning + contribution from persistently elevated BUN. Could also
   represent delirium in setting, ? underlying infection given rise in
   leukocytosis although afebrile.
   - Continue leukocytosis w/u as above

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, acute renal failure, shock liver, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, leukocytosis, transaminitis, and acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which may be due to hypovolemia or cardiogenic causes. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary to manage this condition.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to hypotension. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) has been started, and the patient needs hemodialysis once more when hemodynamically stable.

3. Shock Liver: The patient has transaminitis, which is improving but still requires monitoring. The patient's bilirubin levels are also rising, and further evaluation is needed.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Rate control with metoprolol and digoxin therapy is being continued, with close monitoring of digoxin levels.

5. Anemia: The"

   - Family agreed to temporary CVVH.  If he clears from uremia, can
   re-address with patient desire for HD.
   - Renal: Attempted IJ dialysis catheter, but were unable to place it so
   Right femoral HD line was placed.  Started on CVVH in evening after
   receiving 4 u FFP, SBP dropped to 80
s briefly when CVVH paused for
   filter issue/change.  A-line placed, neo restarted at 0.5 mcg/min.
   - Hct dropped this am from 34 ->28, repeat Hct this am
   - Will have to change dig dose per pharmacy for CVVH dosing. Get levels

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical complications, including atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): AFib is a condition characterized by irregular heart rhythm, which can lead to blood clots and increase the risk of stroke or other cardiovascular events.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to several factors, including the effects of medication, hypoxemia, or underlying brain injury. It is important to closely monitor the patient's mental status for any changes that may indicate worsening neurological function.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels in the blood can compromise tissue perfusion and lead to organ dysfunction. Continuous monitoring and support with supplemental oxygen may be necessary.
4. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient has experienced an acute heart attack, resulting in damage to the heart muscle. This increases the risk of complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and further cardiac events.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function is compromised, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, accumulation of waste products in the body, and the need for renal replacement"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the
   unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of anticoagulation
   complicated by hypotension, acute on chronic CHF, ARF necessitating
   CVVH, shock liver.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Concerning for hypovolemic etiology in setting of new
   Hct drop and fluid shifts in CVVH.  Hct improved over the course of the
   day, however again slightly decreased this morning.  Patient has also
   had significantly better perfusion over hospital course when in sinus
   instead of afib; appears to have been in afib throughout last 24
   hours.  Pressors not restarted. Transaminitis, INR and lactate
   stabilizing, suggesting improved perfusion state however mental status
   significantly worse this am (difficult to interpret in setting of
   continued elevated BUN).  CXR with increased opacities at bases
   bilaterally, possible pleural effusions.  Patient afebrile and without
   growth on cultures but with WBC that continues to creep up, concerning
   for possible evolving septic picture.
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Treat AF as below with dig, beta blocker
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, CvO2, lactate, liver function,
   mentation
   - Would give IVF cautiously if requires given CHF
   - If need to restart pressors, would use neo
   - Check repeat Hct later this am
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading.
   - Rate control with metoprolol
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Discussed with pharmacy.  Will switch to daily digoxin dosing given
   dig level today.
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - No anticoagulation given GIB, unstable Hct
   - F/u cards recs
   #Anemia: Admitted with coffee ground emesis; continues to have tarry
   black stool (several times yesterday).  PO PPI changed to IV for
   difficulty swallowing.  Bowel regimen held for several BM over the day.
   - hold bowel regimen with colace/senna
   - Repeat check Hct this am, transfuse for Hct <30
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs,
   started CVVH yesterday.  Bicarb d/c
ed now that on CVVH.  [**Month (only) 11**] need HD
   once more hemodynamically stable.
   - Monitor lytes
   - Monitor mental status
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - F/u renal recs
   # Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile, but on CVVH. Cx without growth, c diff
   negative x 1, CXR without obvious infiltrate .
   - repeat blood, urine cx, repeat c.difff
    - Continue to trend WBC, temp.
   # AMS: Confusion at night with non-focal neuro exam. [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of sundowning + contribution from elevated BUN, possible evolving
   underlying infection given rise in leukocytosis although afebrile.
   - Continue leukocytosis w/u as above
   - CVVH as above
   - Could consider low-dose antipsychotics if very agitated but no need
   for now
   # Transaminitis: Evaluated by Liver and thought likely shock liver with
   transaminitis improving, however Tbili still rising.  [**6-20**] abd U/S with
   no specific cholecystitis signs or biliary dilatation. Started on
   ursodiol and sarna for itching, could consider cholestyramine.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Per liver recs, will continue trending Tbili for next 24 hours, if no
   improvement will consider repeat RUQ u/s
   - MRCP/ERCP on hold pending increased patient stability
   - F/u liver recs
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP very elevated at >70K
   - Cont dig and beta blocker; conservation IV fluids if needed, neo as
   pressor to maintain MAP >65
   - Monitor on telemetry

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. The patient has a history of acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ATN), and confusion. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to renal failure and is being treated with digoxin, beta-blockers, pantoprazole, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia, especially considering the new Hct drop and fluid shifts in CVVH. It is important to monitor the patient's perfusion status, including urine output (UOP), cardiac output (CvO2), lactate levels, mental status, and liver function tests (LFTs).

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension. CVVH has been initiated, but the patient needs further evaluation by a nephrologist. Monitoring electrolyte levels and adjusting fluid intake accordingly is important. A repeat check of Hct is recommended, and transfusion may be necessary if Hct <30.

3. Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleed: The patient has ongoing tarry black stool, indicating a potential upper"

   88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the
   unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of anticoagulation
   complicated by hypotension, acute on chronic CHF, ARF necessitating
   CVVH, shock liver.
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis - Likely upper GI source in setting of
   therapeutic INR, ddx includes PUD, ASA-induced gastritis, malignancy.
   - EGD to evaluate for active bleeding, will need reversal of
   anticoagulation prior to INR < 2.0, give 2 u FFP and repeat INR
   - has received 2 u pRBC now for decreased Hct, check Hct q6hr
   - continue PPI gtt
   - f/u GI recs
   - access = 3 PIV
   - hold ASA, coumadin
   .
   # Hypotension- Patient with poor CO (EF 25%) and clinically volume
   depleted.  Increasing anion gap (12 -> 16) with lactate 2.2 further
   supports hypo-perfusion.  Has received 2 L in ED and 1 L on floor, 2 u
   pRBC and 3 u FFP.
   - Gentle fluids given poor EF, goal MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam
   - place a-line
   - continue monitoring on tele
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure- Baseline Cre appears to be around 2.0, current
   Cre 3.1 with K 5.7, no EKG changes.  Likely pre-renal given patient's
   fluid depleted clinical status
   - gentle IVF given EF
   - check UA and urine lytes
   - will hold on kayexelate pending procedure
   - recheck lytes in pm
   .
   # Transaminitis/Abdominal pain- Possibly due to irritation caused by
   blood in abdomen, however components of history sound like biliary
   colic (transient pain in a band-like distribution, improved with
   belching and resolved within hours on arrival to ED).  Does not sound
   like anginal equivalent, first two sets CE negative.  LFT's with
   markedly elevated AST and ALT, hyperbilirubinemia (primarily
   conjugated) suggesting obstructive picture.
   - trend LFT's, amylase, lipase
   - RUQ u/s
   - continue ROMI
   .
   # Heart Failure- most recent EF 25% with severe hypokinesis.  Has been
   anticoagulated to prevent intra-ventricular thrombus formation.
   Currently appears volume depleted, goal is to keep patient euvolemic.
   - volume repletion to goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/hr

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He was transferred from the emergency department for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. The patient has a history of acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and shock liver. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/46 to 136/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a confirmed upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding, as evidenced by coffee ground emesis and a therapeutic INR. There is a need for endoscopy to evaluate for active bleeding, and anticoagulation reversal prior to the procedure. The differential diagnosis includes peptic ulcer disease (PUD), aspirin-induced gastritis, and malignancy.

2. Hypotension: The patient is volume depleted with a poor cardiac output (EF 25%) and clinically hypotensive. Increasing anion gap with lactate 2.2 further supports hypo-perfusion. The patient has received 2 liters of fluids in the emergency department and 1"

   .
   # Hypotension:  Concerning for hypovolemic etiology in setting of new
   Hct drop and fluid shifts in CVVH.  Hct improved over the course of the
   day, however again slightly decreased this morning.  Patient has also
   had significantly better perfusion over hospital course when in sinus
   instead of afib; appears to have been in afib throughout last 24
   hours.  Pressors not restarted. Transaminitis, INR and lactate
   stabilizing, suggesting improved perfusion state however mental status
   significantly worse this am (difficult to interpret in setting of
   continued elevated BUN).  CXR with increased opacities at bases
   bilaterally, possible pleural effusions.  Patient afebrile and without
   growth on cultures but with WBC that continues to creep up, concerning
   for possible evolving septic picture.
   - Treat AF as below with dig, beta blocker
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, CvO2, lactate, liver function,
   mentation
   - Would give IVF cautiously if requires given CHF
   - If need to restart pressors, would use neo
   - Check repeat Hct later this am
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading.
   - Rate control with metoprolol
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Discussed with pharmacy.  Will switch to daily digoxin dosing given
   dig level today.
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - No anticoagulation given GIB, unstable Hct
   - F/u cards recs
   #Anemia: Admitted with coffee ground emesis; continues to have tarry
   black stool (several times yesterday).  PO PPI changed to IV for
   difficulty swallowing.  Bowel regimen held for several BM over the day.
   - hold bowel regimen with colace/senna
   - Repeat check Hct this am, transfuse for Hct <30
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs,
   started CVVH yesterday.  Bicarb d/c
ed now that on CVVH.  [**Month (only) 11**] need HD
   once more hemodynamically stable.
   - Monitor lytes
   - Monitor mental status
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - F/u renal recs
   # Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile, but on CVVH. Cx without growth, c diff
   negative x 1, CXR without obvious infiltrate .
   - repeat blood, urine cx, repeat c.difff
    - Continue to trend WBC, temp.
   # AMS: Confusion at night with non-focal neuro exam. [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of sundowning + contribution from elevated BUN, possible evolving
   underlying infection given rise in leukocytosis although afebrile.
   - Continue leukocytosis w/u as above
   - CVVH as above
   - Could consider low-dose antipsychotics if very agitated but no need
   for now
   # Transaminitis: Evaluated by Liver and thought likely shock liver with
   transaminitis improving, however Tbili still rising.  [**6-20**] abd U/S with
   no specific cholecystitis signs or biliary dilatation. Started on
   ursodiol and sarna for itching, could consider cholestyramine.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Per liver recs, will continue trending Tbili for next 24 hours, if no
   improvement will consider repeat RUQ u/s
   - MRCP/ERCP on hold pending increased patient stability
   - F/u liver recs
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP very elevated at >70K
   - Cont dig and beta blocker; conservation IV fluids if needed, neo as
   pressor to maintain MAP >65
   - Monitor on telemetry

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the unit for evaluation of new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. He has a history of acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ATN), and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled heart rate and blood pressure, but his mental status has worsened. He has ongoing GI bleeding, anemia, leukocytosis, transaminitis, and acute on chronic CHF. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a risk of inadequate tissue perfusion and potential shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient's ongoing black tarry stools and coffee ground emesis suggest ongoing upper GI bleeding. Continued monitoring of hemodynamic status, repeat Hct checks, and transfusion for Hct <30 are required.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ATN): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. Monitoring electrolytes, fluid intake, and output is essential. CVVH should be continued until the patient's renal function improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the
   unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of anticoagulation
   complicated by hypotension, acute on chronic CHF, ARF necessitating
   CVVH, shock liver.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Concerning for hypovolemic etiology in setting of new
   Hct drop and fluid shifts in CVVH.  Hct improved over the course of the
   day, however again slightly decreased this morning.  Patient has also
   had significantly better perfusion over hospital course when in sinus
   instead of afib; appears to have been in afib throughout last 24
   hours.  Pressors not restarted. Transaminitis, INR and lactate
   stabilizing, suggesting improved perfusion state however mental status
   significantly worse this am (difficult to interpret in setting of
   continued elevated BUN).  CXR with increased opacities at bases
   bilaterally, possible pleural effusions.  Patient afebrile and without
   growth on cultures but with WBC that continues to creep up, concerning
   for possible evolving septic picture.
   - Treat AF as below with dig, beta blocker
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, CvO2, lactate, liver function,
   mentation
   - Would give IVF cautiously if requires given CHF
   - If need to restart pressors, would use neo
   - Check repeat Hct later this am
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading.
   - Rate control with metoprolol
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Discussed with pharmacy.  Will switch to daily digoxin dosing given
   dig level today.
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - No anticoagulation given GIB, unstable Hct
   - F/u cards recs
   #Anemia: Admitted with coffee ground emesis; continues to have tarry
   black stool (several times yesterday).  PO PPI changed to IV for
   difficulty swallowing.  Bowel regimen held for several BM over the day.
   - hold bowel regimen with colace/senna
   - Repeat check Hct this am, transfuse for Hct <30
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs,
   started CVVH yesterday.  Bicarb d/c
ed now that on CVVH.  [**Month (only) 11**] need HD
   once more hemodynamically stable.
   - Monitor lytes
   - Monitor mental status
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - F/u renal recs
   # Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile, but on CVVH. Cx without growth, c diff
   negative x 1, CXR without obvious infiltrate .
   - f/u Ucx, CXR, stool for C. diff.
   - Continue to trend WBC, temp.
   # AMS: Confusion at night with non-focal neuro exam. [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of sundowning + contribution from elevated BUN, possible evolving
   underlying infection given rise in leukocytosis although afebrile.
   - Continue leukocytosis w/u as above
   - CVVH as above
   - Could consider low-dose antipsychotics if very agitated but no need
   for now
   # Transaminitis: Evaluated by Liver and thought likely shock liver with
   transaminitis improving, however Tbili still rising.  [**6-20**] abd U/S with
   no specific cholecystitis signs or biliary dilatation. Started on
   ursodiol and sarna for itching, could consider cholestyramine.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Per liver recs, will continue trending Tbili for next 24 hours, if no
   improvement will consider repeat RUQ u/s
   - MRCP/ERCP on hold pending increased patient stability
   - F/u liver recs
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP very elevated at >70K
   - Cont dig and beta blocker; conservation IV fluids if needed, neo as
   pressor to maintain MAP >65
   - Monitor on telemetry

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate), OK to intubate
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the ICU for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation. The patient has a history of acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), and confusion.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.1 C (96.9 F)
- Heart rate: 75 bpm
- Blood pressure: 110/46 mmHg (82/40 - 136/68 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Left bundle branch block (LBBB) on ECG

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hematocrit (Hct): 32.7%
- White blood cell count (WBC): 14.8 - 17.1 thousand/mm3
- Platelet count (Plt): 159 - 181 thousand/mm3
- Creatinine (Cr): 3.3 - 5.4 mg/dL
- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 19 - 21 mg/dL
- Glucose: 64 - 80 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 1.87 ng/mL
- Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may be due to hypovolemia or ongoing GI bleeding.
2. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient has been experiencing tarry black stools and coffee-ground emesis. The source of bleeding needs to be identified and controlled.
3. Acute on chronic CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, and the current symptoms suggest exacerbation. Close monitoring of fluid status and cardiac function is necessary.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has signs of kidney dysfunction, including elevated creatinine and BUN levels. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated to manage the renal failure.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.
6. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion, which may be due to multiple factors such as elevated BUN, evolving infection, or medication effects.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver injury. This could be related to shock liver or other underlying causes.
8. Potential complications: Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and ongoing medical issues, there is a risk of further deterioration, including worsening CHF, sepsis, or multiorgan failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:
- Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, and renal function.
- Management of hypotension with appropriate fluid resuscitation and pressor support.
- Identification and control of the GI bleed source.
- Optimization of heart failure management with diuretics and beta-blockers.
- Continued evaluation and treatment of ARF.
- Investigation of the cause of leukocytosis and potential infection.
- Evaluation of altered mental status and potential contributing factors.
- Monitoring of liver function and consideration of further interventions.
- Frequent reassessment and adjustment of the treatment plan based on the patient's response and new developments."

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the
   unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of anticoagulation.
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis - Likely upper GI source in setting of
   therapeutic INR, ddx includes PUD, ASA-induced gastritis, malignancy.
   - EGD to evaluate for active bleeding, will need reversal of
   anticoagulation prior to INR < 2.0, give 2 u FFP and repeat INR
   - has received 2 u pRBC now for decreased Hct, check Hct q6hr
   - continue PPI gtt
   - f/u GI recs
   - access = 3 PIV
   - hold ASA, coumadin
   .
   # Hypotension- Patient with poor CO (EF 25%) and clinically volume
   depleted.  Increasing anion gap (12 -> 16) with lactate 2.2 further
   supports hypo-perfusion.  Has received 2 L in ED and 1 L on floor, 2 u
   pRBC and 3 u FFP.
   - Gentle fluids given poor EF, goal MAP>60 and UOP >30 cc/hr
   - follow perfusion status clinically with UOP, mentation, skin exam
   - place a-line
   - continue monitoring on tele
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure- Baseline Cre appears to be around 2.0, current
   Cre 3.1 with K 5.7, no EKG changes.  Likely pre-renal given patient's
   fluid depleted clinical status
   - gentle IVF given EF
   - check UA and urine lytes
   - will hold on kayexelate pending procedure
   - recheck lytes in pm
   .
   # Transaminitis/Abdominal pain- Possibly due to irritation caused by
   blood in abdomen, however components of history sound like biliary
   colic (transient pain in a band-like distribution, improved with
   belching and resolved within hours on arrival to ED).  Does not sound
   like anginal equivalent, first two sets CE negative.  LFT's with
   markedly elevated AST and ALT, hyperbilirubinemia (primarily
   conjugated) suggesting obstructive picture.
   - trend LFT's, amylase, lipase
   - RUQ u/s
   - continue ROMI
   .
   # Heart Failure- most recent EF 25% with severe hypokinesis.  Has been
   anticoagulated to prevent intra-ventricular thrombus formation.
   Currently appears volume depleted, goal is to keep patient euvolemic.
   - volume repletion to goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - monitor on telemetry
   - anticoagulation on hold for now
   - SvO2 and lactate wnl
   .
   #DM
   - hold glyburide while inpatient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and hypotension. He has been evaluated for a new upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed while on anticoagulation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 110s and heart rate in the 70s. He is receiving mechanical ventilation support and has an arterial line placed. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, indicating possible infection, anemia, and tissue hypoperfusion. There are also signs of acute renal failure with elevated creatinine and potassium levels. Liver function tests reveal elevated AST and ALT, as well as hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting possible liver involvement. The patient's ejection fraction is severely reduced at 25%, indicating heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing coffee ground emesis, which suggests an upper GI source. Given his therapeutic INR due to anticoagulation, there is a risk of continued bleeding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been planned to evaluate for active bleeding and reverse anticoagulation prior to INR < 2.0. 
2. Hypotension: The patient is volume depleted and has poor cardiac output (EF 25%). Hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation, indicating ongoing perfusion concerns. Gentle fluid administration is"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the
   unit for evaluation of new UGI bleed in setting of anticoagulation
   complicated by hypotension, acute on chronic CHF, ARF necessitating
   CVVH, shock liver.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Concerning for hypovolemic etiology in setting of new
   Hct drop and fluid shifts in CVVH.  Hct improved over the course of the
   day, however again slightly decreased this morning.  Patient has also
   had significantly better perfusion over hospital course when in sinus
   instead of afib; appears to have been in afib throughout last 24
   hours.  Pressors not restarted. Transaminitis, INR and lactate
   stabilizing, suggesting improved perfusion state however mental status
   significantly worse this am (difficult to interpret in setting of
   continued elevated BUN).  CXR with increased opacities at bases
   bilaterally, possible pleural effusions.  Patient afebrile and without
   growth on cultures but with WBC that continues to creep up, concerning
   for possible evolving septic picture.
   - Continue to follow Hct
   - Treat AF as below with dig, beta blocker
   - Follow perfusion status with UOP, CvO2, lactate, liver function,
   mentation
   - Would give IVF cautiously if requires given CHF
   - If need to restart pressors, would use neo
   - Check repeat Hct later this am
   # A-fib with RVR v. SVT with aberrancy: Has mostly been in sinus since
   dig loading.
   - Rate control with metoprolol
   - Continue dig and follow levels
   - Discussed with pharmacy.  Will switch to daily digoxin dosing given
   dig level today.
   - Monitor ECG, tele
   - No anticoagulation given GIB, unstable Hct
   - F/u cards recs
   #Anemia: Admitted with coffee ground emesis; continues to have tarry
   black stool (several times yesterday).  PO PPI changed to IV for
   difficulty swallowing.  Bowel regimen held for several BM over the day.
   - hold bowel regimen with colace/senna
   - Repeat check Hct this am, transfuse for Hct <30
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension per renal recs,
   started CVVH yesterday.  Bicarb d/c
ed now that on CVVH.  [**Month (only) 11**] need HD
   once more hemodynamically stable.
   - Monitor lytes
   - Monitor mental status
   - Liberalize po fluid intake
   - F/u renal recs
   # Leukocytosis: Pt afebrile, but on CVVH. Cx without growth, c diff
   negative x 1, CXR without obvious infiltrate .
   - repeat blood, urine cx, repeat c.difff
    - Continue to trend WBC, temp.
   # AMS: Confusion at night with non-focal neuro exam. [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of sundowning + contribution from elevated BUN, possible evolving
   underlying infection given rise in leukocytosis although afebrile.
   - Continue leukocytosis w/u as above
   - CVVH as above
   - Could consider low-dose antipsychotics if very agitated but no need
   for now
   # Transaminitis: Evaluated by Liver and thought likely shock liver with
   transaminitis improving, however Tbili still rising.  [**6-20**] abd U/S with
   no specific cholecystitis signs or biliary dilatation. Started on
   ursodiol and sarna for itching, could consider cholestyramine.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase, lipase
   - Per liver recs, will continue trending Tbili for next 24 hours, if no
   improvement will consider repeat RUQ u/s
   - MRCP/ERCP on hold pending increased patient stability
   - F/u liver recs
   # Acute on Chronic CHF: BNP very elevated at >70K
   - Cont dig and beta blocker; conservation IV fluids if needed, neo as
   pressor to maintain MAP >65
   - Monitor on telemetry

","The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted for abdominal pain and hypotension, transferred to the unit for evaluation of a new upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of anticoagulation, complicated by hypotension, acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF) necessitating continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and shock liver.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be concerning for hypovolemic etiology due to ongoing fluid shifts in CVVH. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and ensure adequate perfusion.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has been in AF throughout the last 24 hours, which can lead to an irregular ventricular response and reduced cardiac output. Rate control with medications like metoprolol should be continued, and digoxin levels should be monitored.

3. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing tarry black stool and coffee ground emesis, indicating ongoing GI bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been dropping, and transfusion for Hct <30 should be considered.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is likely affected due to hypotension, and CVVH has been started. Close monitoring of electrolytes and mental status is necessary."

The patient experienced hypotension and required Neo overnight but restarted CVVH in the morning. The CVVH machine malfunctioned, leading to the restart of Neo to support blood pressure. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/38 mmHg to 136/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) heart rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, decreased total carbon dioxide levels, low glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The assessment and plan include atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis due to leukocytosis, further deterioration of renal function, worsening of liver injury, and potential bleeding events considering the presence of upper gastrointestinal bleed and altered mental status. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, renal and liver function, hemodynamic stability, and any changes in mental status."

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is heart failure, and the patient is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 84/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, hypoxemia, acute myocardial infarction, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which could be due to overdiuresis, bowel ischemia, or cardiac dysfunction. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's fluid balance and vasopressor requirements.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), but the machine is malfunctioning. Even without CVVH, the patient is on pressors, so it may not be possible to go back on CVVH.
3. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which could be due to blood loss. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to overdiuresis, bowel ischemia, or cardiac dysfunction. The physician plans to discuss overall goals of care with the son as the patient requires vasopressors to maintain hemodynamic support.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) due to ARF, but the machine is malfunctioning. Since the patient is already on pressors, it may not be possible to go back on CVVH. The physician will assess the situation as the day progresses.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, suggesting anemia. The differential diagnosis includes blood loss, possibly from a slow gastrointestinal (GI) ooze. Further investigation and management are needed.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. The physician has ordered pan culturing and empiric antibiotic therapy for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) with Flagyl.

5. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is deteriorating, likely due to a combination of uremia (kidney dysfunction), hyperbilirubinemia (increased bilir"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a concern for overdiuresis, bowel ischemia, or cardiac dysfunction.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and decreased urine output. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has not been successful in improving renal function.

3. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which may be due to blood loss or ischemic bowel.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection.

5. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of uremia, hyperbilirubinemia, and ICU delirium.

6. Liver injury: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, suggesting possible liver dysfunction.

7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by melena (black, tarry stools).

8. Myocardial infarction (heart attack): The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, specifically a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction).

9. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned in the progress note.

24-hour events include blood cultures being taken, removal and replacement of the PICC line, pulling the Foley catheter, consultation with urology, irrigation, and episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (fib). The patient experienced hypotension and required Neo (vasopressor) support, as well as calcium gluconate and potassium chloride infusions through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate 71 bpm, blood pressure 94/41 mmHg (72/31-147/69 mmHg), respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is left bundle branch block (LBBB).

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,807 mL and output of 2,725 mL, resulting in a balance of 82 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a non-rebreather mask with a SpO2 of 100%. ABG results show pH 7.47, PaCO2 20 mmHg, SaO2 109%, and HCO3- 14 mEq/L.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 147 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 1.8 mg/dL, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 82 mg/dL, and liver function abnormalities with elevated ALT and AST levels.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension: Differential diagnosis includes overdiuresis, bowel ischemia, and cardiac dysfunction. The patient is currently on Neo again, but the overall goals of care need to be discussed as the patient is unable to be hemodynamically supported without vasopressors.
2. ARF: The patient is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) with machine malfunctioning. However, the patient is on pressors even without CVVH, so it may not be possible to go back on CVVH.
3. Anemia: The differential diagnosis includes blood loss and possible slow gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient is pan-cultured, and empirical antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile with Flagyl has been initiated.
5. Mental status: The patient likely has a combination of uremia, hyperbilir"

   Disposition:
","The patient's medical progress note indicates several potential medical complications. Firstly, there is an arterial line stop with subsequent blood return and attempts at flushing failing to return any urine, leading to a suspicion of clot retention. This could potentially result in renal complications if not promptly addressed.

Secondly, the patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 71/34 mmHg to 95/71 mmHg. Hypotension can lead to decreased perfusion to vital organs and may indicate septic shock or other circulatory issues.

Thirdly, the patient has altered mental status and is not experiencing delirium. This could be a result of various factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or the underlying medical conditions.

Fourthly, the patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by the high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. This can further complicate the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of complications.

Fifthly, the patient has liver function abnormalities, with elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and abnormal bilirubin levels. This could be a sign of hepatic injury or dysfunction, which can affect multiple organ systems.

Lastly, the patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of melena. This could potentially lead to anemia and further complications if not managed appropriately.

Based on the information provided, these are the potential medical complications that can arise."
