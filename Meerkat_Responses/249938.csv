   Assessment and Plan
   78 yom, never smoker, myelofibrosis, Zencker's diverticulum, now with
   hypoxemia and new large right sided pleural effusion.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia.  Resolved.  Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to atalecatic lung (due to large effusion), now
   reexpanded partially.
   INFILTRATES -- RLL > LLL.  Perhaps persistent atalectasis vs.
   pneumonia.  COncern for pneumonia, although some concern for
   malignancy.  At risk for reexpansion pulmomnary edema.  Monitor CXR.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION -- Exudative (Thoracentesis with 1200cc of
   serosanguinous fluid removed - pH 7.08, LDH >400, WBC 2550 with 89%
   PMN, Gram stain negative) --now drained with pigtail catheter in
   place.  [**Month (only) 60**] represent complex parapneumonic effusion, (pt at risk for
   aspiration pneumonia).  Doubt tuberculosis.  No evidence for empyema
   (low pH likely reflects complex effusion).  Other possible etiologies
   include malignancy, less likely pulmonary embolism with infact.  No
   evidence for hemothorax.  Plan continue empirical antimicrobials, and
   await additional studies, including cultures, cytology.  Maintain chest
   tube.  IP service to continue follow.
   ZENCKERS DIVERTICULUM -- places at risk for aspiration pneumonia.  If
   effusion attributable to aspiration pneumonia, would revisit possible
   surgical correction of Zencker
s diverticulum.
   MYELOFIBROSIS
 monitor peripheral WBc, plts.
   ANEMIA -- baseline.  Monitor.
   s/p RECENT FALL -- local care to wounds.  Pain management.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normal pupils, symmetrical chest expansion, clear breath sounds with crackles on the right side, and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Neurological examination shows the patient attentive, oriented, and following simple commands.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 151 K/uL, elevated potassium levels (142 mEq/L), and a slightly low hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL.

The assessment and plan include hypotension resolved but to be monitored, hypoxemia attributed to atelectatic lung due to large effusion, infiltrates in the right lower lung field, and a large exudative pleural effusion. The pleural effusion has been drained with a pigtail catheter and empirical antimicrobials have been continued. Additional studies, including cultures and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. They have a history of chronic anemia, pneumonia due to aspiration, and falls. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/43 mmHg to 138/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on morphine sulfate and heparin sodium infusions.

The review of systems remains unchanged except for improved symptoms of right back pain and shortness of breath when sitting upright. The physical examination shows diminished breath sounds at the right base, muscle wasting, and right lower extremity edema. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit and albumin levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, nutritional support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The pleural fluid analysis is negative for malignant cells but shows numerous neutrophils.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and diminished breath sounds at the right base suggest a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or"

   #: Right Exudative Pleural Effusion, Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Pt with large right sided pleural effusion on presentation, now s/p
   thoracentesis with right pigtail catheter. Effusion appears to be
   exudative given low pH of 7.08 and high pleural LDH. Differential
   etiologies include parapneumonic, malignancy less likely although
   possible as pt is not up to date with cancer screening,  PE, TB (no
   known exposure), Connective Tissue Disease, esophageal rupture (no
   evidence), post-MI (CEs flat).
   - Right Pigtail to water seal, possible VATS, will d/w IP/thoracic,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis admitted with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note.

1. Right Exudative Pleural Effusion: The patient has a large right-sided pleural effusion, which is exudative in nature. The differential etiologies include parapneumonic, malignancy (although less likely), pulmonary embolism (PE), tuberculosis (TB), connective tissue disease, and esophageal rupture (no evidence). The patient is currently on right pigtail catheter and water seal, with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) planned.

2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The underlying cause is multifocal pneumonia involving nearly the entire right lung and large portions of the left lower lobe. The patient is receiving Combivent nebs and being weaned off oxygen as tolerated.

3. Chronic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia likely secondary to myelofibrosis. It is macrocytic in nature and there is evidence of splenomegaly on examination potentially secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis. The patient's Hct on presentation was 28 prior to receiving 3 liters of normal saline (NS) while in the emergency department (ED). The baseline H"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yom, never smoker, myelofibrosis, Zencker's diverticulum, now with
   hypoxemia and new large right sided pleural effusion.
   HYPOTENSION -- Attributed to hypovolemia.  Resolved.  Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to atalecatic lung (due to large effusion), now
   reexpanded partially.
   INFILTRATES -- RLL >> LLL.  Perhaps persistent atalectasis vs.
   pneumonia.  Concern for pneumonia, although some concern for
   malignancy.  At risk for reexpansion pulmomnary edema.  Monitor CXR.
   PLEURAL EFFUSION -- Exudative (Thoracentesis with 1200cc of
   serosanguinous fluid removed - pH 7.08, LDH >400, WBC 2550 with 89%
   PMN, Gram stain negative) --now drained with pigtail catheter in
   place.  [**Month (only) 60**] represent complex parapneumonic effusion, (pt at risk for
   aspiration pneumonia).  Doubt tuberculosis.  No evidence for empyema
   (low pH likely reflects complex effusion).  Other possible etiologies
   include malignancy, less likely pulmonary embolism with infact.  No
   evidence for hemothorax.  Plan continue empirical antimicrobials, and
   await additional studies, including cultures, cytology.  Maintain chest
   tube.  IP service to continue follow --> Thoracic Surgery to assess
   whether additional drainage of right chest required.
   ZENCKERS DIVERTICULUM -- places at risk for aspiration pneumonia.  If
   effusion attributable to aspiration pneumonia, would revisit possible
   surgical correction of Zencker
s diverticulum.  GI service and ENT
   service to evaluate.
   MYELOFIBROSIS
 monitor peripheral WBc, plts.
   ANEMIA -- baseline.  Monitor.
   s/p RECENT FALL -- local care to wounds.  Pain management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of myelofibrosis, Zencker's diverticulum, and hypoxemia. He presented with hypotension, which has resolved, and now has a new large right-sided pleural effusion. His current condition includes infiltrates in the right lower lobe of the lung, likely due to atelectasis or pneumonia, and an exudative pleural effusion that was drained with a pigtail catheter. The patient has a complex parapneumonic effusion and is at risk for aspiration pneumonia. He is being treated with empirical antimicrobials and awaiting additional studies. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reexpansion Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a partially reexpanded lung due to drainage of the pleural effusion. This can lead to reexpansion pulmonary edema, which is a potential complication.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has infiltrates in the right lower lobe of the lung, which could indicate pneumonia. This can worsen his respiratory status and lead to sepsis.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to Zencker's diverticulum, the patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia. This can further complicate his respiratory status.
4. Pleural Space Infection: Although the pleural effusion has been drained, there is still a risk of developing a pleural space infection such as empyema.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of myelofibrosis and Zencker's diverticulum. He presented with hypoxemia and was found to have a large right-sided pleural effusion. The patient's hypotension was attributed to hypovolemia, which has since resolved. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 118/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate respiratory distress or impairment. This could be due to the large pleural effusion causing atelectasis or pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an exudative pleural effusion, which may be secondary to pneumonia, malignancy, or other causes. There is a risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema if the effusion re-expands rapidly. Monitoring chest X-rays and maintaining the pigtail catheter to drain the fluid is recommended.

3. Zencker's Diverticulum: The patient has Zencker's diverticulum, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of aspiration pneumonia and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of myelofibrosis, Zencker's diverticulum, hypoxemia, and a large right-sided pleural effusion. The patient has been experiencing right-sided pleurisy, although it has improved today. He is up in a chair and not requiring narcotics. The chest tube (pigtail) is not draining.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/47-138/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.27, PaCO2 of 27 mmHg, and PaO2 of 106 mmHg.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of edema. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, with crackles heard on the right side. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. The extremities show trace edema on the right lower extremity and no cyanosis or clubbing. The patient's neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 208 K/uL, blood glucose of 134 mg/dL, and sodium of 139 mEq/L. The chest X-ray shows re-expansion of the right lung.

Assessment and Plan:
1. HYPOTENSION - Resolved, monitor blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg.
2. HYPOXEMIA - Partially re-expanded due to large effusion, monitor oxygen saturation and consider interventions to improve gas exchange.
3. INFILTRATES - Right lower lobe more than left lower lobe, concern for pneumonia or atelectasis. Monitor chest X-ray and consider additional studies.
4. PLEURAL EFFUSION - Exudative, drained with pigtail catheter. Continue empirical antimicrobials and await additional studies, including cultures and cytology. Maintain chest tube and consult Thoracic Surgery for further evaluation.
5. ZENCKER'S DIVERTICULUM - At risk for aspiration pneumonia, evaluate by GI and ENT services.
6. MYELOFIBROSIS - Monitor peripheral WBC and platelets.
7. ANEMIA - Monitor.
8. s/p RECENT FALL - Local care to wounds and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reexpansion Pulmonary Edema - Due to rapid re-expansion of the collapsed lung, which can lead to pulmonary edema.
2. Pneumonia - The patient's infiltrates may be indicative of pneumonia, especially considering the Zencker"
