   ascites, encephalopathy and recurrent pleural effusion presenting for
   evaluation for liver evaluation, transfered to the MICU for worsening
   hypoxia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, ascites, encephalopathy, and recurrent pleural effusion. She presented for evaluation of liver evaluation and was transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable on NRB and is being closely monitored for respiratory status. Thoracentesis was performed, draining 1.5 liters of transudative fluid from the pleural space. The patient is awaiting further evaluation for possible liver transplant. Diagnostic paracentesis did not show signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is being treated with rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy and will have her AFP, anti-sm, mitochondrial, [Doctor First Name], HCV, and HBV levels checked. Due to recent drinking, she is unlikely to be a candidate for liver transplant. TIPS is also not an option due to encephalopathy. Percocet, tylenol, and ativan will be withheld given her encephalopathy. Leukocytosis is present but without a clear source of infection. The patient has been afebrile and has received broad-spectrum antibiotics on admission. Repeat CXR is planned after [Female First Name] to check for hidden pneumonia, and para will be sent to look for SBP. Further antibiotic treatment will be held off. Renal failure is suspected, with a creatinine level stable at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, ascites, encephalopathy, and recurrent pleural effusion. She presented for evaluation of liver evaluation and was transferred to the MICU due to worsening hypoxia. She is currently hemodynamically stable on NRB and is being closely monitored for respiratory status. A thoracentesis was performed, draining 1.5 liters of transudative fluid. The patient has marked encephalopathy and ascites, and an evaluation for possible liver transplant has been sent. She is also being evaluated for various infections and renal failure. Other issues include leukocytosis, hypothyroidism, and potential hepatic veno-occlusive disease (FEN). The patient's code status is full code, and she will be reassessed after further tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's large pleural effusion with left lobe collapse could be causing her hypoxia. Close monitoring of respiratory status is crucial, with a low threshold to intubate if evidence of tiring.
2. Recurrent Pleural Effusion: The patient has a history of recurrent pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed, but there is a risk of recurrence and further complications.
3. Esophageal Varices: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and ascites, she is at risk for esophageal varices, which can lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and end-stage liver disease (ESLD). The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, and coagulopathy secondary to ESLD. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the resolution of left lung findings after the removal of 1.6 liters of pleural fluid. The patient is currently comfortable and able to breathe without supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure indicates a compromised oxygenation status. This could be due to various factors such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or severe pleural effusion.
2. Left pleural effusion: The presence of a transudative pleural effusion suggests fluid accumulation in the lung cavity. If left untreated, it may reaccumulate and potentially lead to recurrent respiratory distress.
3. End-stage liver disease (ESLD): ESLD is a severe and irreversible condition characterized by liver dysfunction. It can result in complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely related to liver dysfunction. It is essential to continue lactulose and rifaximin therapy to manage this condition.
5. Chronic renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic, chronic renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient's condition has been unstable, with low blood pressure requiring multiple fluid resuscitations. Despite this, the patient's blood pressure remains unstable. His vital signs are within normal limits, except for a low blood pressure reading of 77/46 mmHg. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and has multiple IV lines inserted. His lab results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low sodium, potassium, and calcium. The patient also has elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and he has altered mental status. The patient is on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These may include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure indicates a possible complication of hypotension. This can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and increase the risk of organ damage.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, suggests the possibility of worsening respiratory function. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in further deterioration.

3. Renal failure: The patient's history of"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, ascites, encephalopathy, and recurrent pleural effusion. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of worsening hypoxia and transferred from another facility. 

Upon admission, the patient had a low blood pressure (MAP in the 50s) that did not respond to fluid resuscitation. Her venous lactate level was elevated at 1.4, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 69/34 to 77/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. 

Her physical examination revealed jaundice, altered mental status with intermittent moaning and somnolence, no significant cardiac findings, decreased breath sounds at the bases of the lungs, soft abdominal distension with a positive fluid wave/ascites, no extremity edema, and asterixis on neurologic examination. 

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values including low white blood cell count, elevated bilirubin, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), high blood urea nitrogen (BUN), low sodium, and other electrolyte imbalances.

2. End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD): The patient has marked encephalopathy and ascites. She is being evaluated for possible liver transplant. Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Further tests, including AFP, anti-sm, mitochondrial, [Doctor First Name], HCV, and HBV, are pending. She will continue on rifaximin and lactulose. Due to recent drinking, she is unlikely to be a candidate for liver transplant. Given her encephalopathy, she is also not a candidate for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Medications such as Percocet, Tylenol, and Ativan will be held due to encephalopathy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, ascites, encephalopathy, and recurrent pleural effusion. She was admitted for evaluation of liver disease and transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia. The patient and her family agree to comfort measures only (CMO), discontinuing non-palliative medications, and providing morphine for pain relief. The patient has marked encephalopathy, ascites, and is not a candidate for liver transplantation due to recent drinking. Her renal function remains stable with a Heidelberg Rats score of 3.2. The patient has a large pleural effusion causing left lobe collapse, and oxygenation improved but remains stable with reaccumulation of fluid on chest X-ray. The patient is also experiencing renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a large pleural effusion with left lobe collapse. Oxygenation improved initially but remains stable with reaccumulation of fluid on chest X-ray. The patient may require further interventions to manage the pleural effusion and improve oxygenation.
2. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient has marked encephalopathy and ascites, indicating advanced liver disease. She is not a candidate for liver transplantation due to recent alcohol consumption. The patient may continue to deteriorate without appropriate management of her liver disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. The patient was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been stable but unstable, with intermittent moaning and somnolence. Physical examination reveals icterus, minimal muscle mass, decreased breath sounds at the bases, ascites, and painful legs with diminished pulses. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 79/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and renal dysfunction. The patient is on various medications including heparin, haloperidol, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and altered mental status, hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication that needs to be considered and managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic renal failure and liver disease increases the risk of infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is important.
3. Bleeding: Heparin, a blood thinner, has been initiated for proph"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, ascites, encephalopathy, and recurrent pleural effusion. She was admitted for evaluation of liver issues and transferred to the MICU due to worsening hypoxia. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxia, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), renal failure, and possible hemolysis.

Hypoxia:
The patient's hypoxia is likely caused by a large pleural effusion with left lobe collapse. Oxygenation has improved and remains stable, but a repeat thoracentesis and pleurex catheter may be considered if respiratory compromise occurs.

ESLD:
The patient exhibits marked encephalopathy and ascites, indicating potential liver failure. She is being evaluated for possible liver transplant, with the Hepatology team following up on her case. Diagnostic tests are negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and the patient continues on rifaximin and lactulose. Consideration is given to performing a transplant evaluation.

Renal Failure:
The patient's creatinine level is stable at 3.2, indicating hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Treatment options include octreotide and midodrine. The elevated potassium level is believed to be spurious due to hemolysis.

Other:
The patient is on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin for thrombosis prevention and has peripheral lines for access. Her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, ascites, encephalopathy, and recurrent pleural effusion. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening hypoxia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 63-66 mmHg, heart rate between 79-98 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 90%. The patient is somnolent and occasionally moans. Physical examination reveals jaundice, normal cardiac sounds, decreased breath sounds at the bases of the lungs, a softly distended abdomen with a fluid wave and ascites, and 2+ edema in the lower extremities with weak pulses. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Hydrothorax: This refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space due to liver disease, which can lead to respiratory distress.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): This is a form of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease.
3. Esophageal Varices: Due to portal hypertension, the patient may be at risk of bleeding from enlarged veins in the esophagus.
