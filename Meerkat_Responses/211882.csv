   Imaging: CT Chest ([**2130-5-27**]):
   Increase in amount of loculated right upper pleural effusion,
   associated with total collapse of lung. Chest tube drains only inferior
   portion of the chest, and a new one should be placed for the upper
   portion. Anterior mediastinal hematoma also increased in size. Interval
   improvement of opacities in left lung. Unchanged ascites.
   .
   CXR ([**2130-5-27**] post-intubation):
   Slightly improved aeration of right lung field with persistent apical
   and basilar pleural effusion.
   Microbiology: Tissue culture ([**2130-5-15**]): no growth
   BAL ([**2130-5-27**]): negative Gram stain; culture pending
   [**5-28**] Blood cultures x2 pending, urine culture pending
   ECG: ECG ([**2130-5-27**], 10pm):
   Sinus rhythm at 63 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, diffusely low
   voltage in limb leads and precordial leads (precordial voltage on
   pre-op ECGs was significantly higher), Q wave in III (and ? aVF); no ST
   segment or T wave changes.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   and today with acute respiratory failure during bronchoscopy.  Now with
   new hypotension requiring low-dose of vasopressor support.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure; seems to have been an acute event in the
   setting of bronchoscopy for mucous plugging; respiratory mechanics
   further impaired by large pleural effusion and persistent ascites.  In
   spite of this, however, she is actually oxygenating quite well.
   - wean sedation overnight with the goal of assessing for possible
   extubation in the morning
   - thoracics/IP input appreciated regarding chest tube and recent
   pleurodeses
   - completed course of vancomycin and pip/tazo for suspected VAP; f/u
   BAL results
   .
   ## Anion gap metabolic acidosis; renal function is certainly
   contributing:
   - check repeat electrolytes with lactate now; check blood cultures
   - renal following
   .
   ## Hypotension; may be due to sedation and positive pressure
   ventillation. Concern for sepsis in this setting as well.
   -vanc level
   -start zosyn broad gram - coverage
   - blood cultures now from PICC and peripheral stick
   - wean phenylephrine and propofol as tolerated
   - hold nadolol and hydralazine
   - TTE given anterior mediastinal hematoma and diffusely low voltage on
   ECG
   .
   ## Acute renal failure/oliguria- ATN to hepatorenal
   - start sevelamer (though unlikely to have much effect when not getting
   nutrition) for hyperphosphatemia
   - discontinue acyclovir (per T-SICU team, this was initially started
   out of concern for herpetic labial lesions while on steroids)
   - continue octreotide for suspected hepatorenal syndrome. Hold
   midodrine while on pressors, albumin
   .
   ## T4 mass/lesion
   - goal platelets >70k per neurosurgery given recent spinal surgery
   - dexamethasone (for cord compression) being tapered
   .
   ## Cirrhosis
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - hold midodrine, give octreotide (as above) for suspected hepatorenal
   syndrome
   - holding nadolol
   -albumin 100 grams today
   -daily albumin
   -will need re paracentesis at some point, now especially if unable to
   wean from pressors.
   .
   ## ? UTI; started on empiric ciprofloxacin yesterday; urine culture
   negative, however
   - recheck UA and culture
   - Zosyn
   .
   # Anemia: potentially dilutional but concern in the setting of acute
   sepsis.
   -One unit PRBC, recheck hct
   -guiaiac stools
   .
   ## FEN: NPO for now; nutrition consult for tube feed recs if need for
   intubation persists
   ## DVT Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   ## Access: right PICC, one PIV, right radial arterial line
   ## Code: full
   ## Communication: complicated social situation; per last SW note,
   mother planning to sign HCP forms; need to f/u with SW to see what the
   status of this is
   ## Dispo: pending resolution of respiratory failure, acidosis, renal
   failure; critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. She developed persistent right-sided pleural effusion, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure during bronchoscopy. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension requiring low-dose vasopressor support. She has respiratory failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure/oliguria. Other medical conditions include cirrhosis, T4 mass/lesion, and suspected hepatorenal syndrome. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to impaired respiratory mechanics caused by a large pleural effusion and persistent ascites. She had an acute event during bronchoscopy for mucous plugging. 
2. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: This condition is likely contributing to the patient's renal failure. It is necessary to check repeat electrolytes with lactate now and blood cultures.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sedation and positive pressure ventilation. There is concern for sepsis as well. It is important to monitor vanc level, start zosyn broad gram-coverage, and check blood cultures.
4. Acute renal failure/oliguria: The patient has acute renal failure/oliguria, possibly due to hepatorenal syndrome."

   Imaging: CT Chest ([**2130-5-27**]):
   Increase in amount of loculated right upper pleural effusion,
   associated with total collapse of lung. Chest tube drains only inferior
   portion of the chest, and a new one should be placed for the upper
   portion. Anterior mediastinal hematoma also increased in size. Interval
   improvement of opacities in left lung. Unchanged ascites.
   .
   CXR ([**2130-5-27**] post-intubation):
   Slightly improved aeration of right lung field with persistent apical
   and basilar pleural effusion.
   Microbiology: Tissue culture ([**2130-5-15**]): no growth
   BAL ([**2130-5-27**]): negative Gram stain; culture pending
   [**5-28**] Blood cultures x2 pending, urine culture pending
   ECG: ECG ([**2130-5-27**], 10pm):
   Sinus rhythm at 63 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, diffusely low
   voltage in limb leads and precordial leads (precordial voltage on
   pre-op ECGs was significantly higher), Q wave in III (and ? aVF); no ST
   segment or T wave changes.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   and today with acute respiratory failure during bronchoscopy.  Now with
   new hypotension requiring low-dose of vasopressor support.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure; seems to have been an acute event in the
   setting of bronchoscopy for mucous plugging; respiratory mechanics
   further impaired by large pleural effusion and persistent ascites.  In
   spite of this, however, she is actually oxygenating quite well.
   - wean sedation overnight with the goal of assessing for possible
   extubation in the morning
   - thoracics/IP input appreciated regarding chest tube and recent
   pleurodeses
   -thoracics posed idea of repeat bronchoscopy this AM, with concern for
   mucus plugging. MICU will consider further bronchoscopy.
   - completed course of vancomycin and pip/tazo for suspected VAP; f/u
   BAL results
   .
   ## Anion gap metabolic acidosis; renal function is certainly
   contributing:
   - check repeat electrolytes with lactate now; check blood cultures
   - renal following
   .
   ## Hypotension; may be due to sedation and positive pressure
   ventillation. Concern for sepsis in this setting as well.
   -f/u vanc level
   -continue zosyn broad gram - coverage
   - blood cultures now from PICC and peripheral stick
   - wean phenylephrine and propofol as tolerated
   - hold nadolol and hydralazine
   - TTE given anterior mediastinal hematoma and diffusely low voltage on
   ECG
   -infectious disease consulted. Follow up recs.
   .
   ## Acute renal failure/oliguria- ATN to hepatorenal
   - start sevelamer (though unlikely to have much effect when not getting
   nutrition) for hyperphosphatemia
   - discontinue acyclovir (per T-SICU team, this was initially started
   out of concern for herpetic labial lesions while on steroids)
   - continue octreotide for suspected hepatorenal syndrome. Hold
   midodrine while on pressors, albumin
   -follow up nephrology recs, especially re: dialysis
   .
   ## T4 mass/lesion
   - goal platelets >70k per neurosurgery given recent spinal surgery
   - dexamethasone (for cord compression) being tapered
   .
   ## Cirrhosis
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - hold midodrine, give octreotide (as above) for suspected hepatorenal
   syndrome
   - holding nadolol
   -albumin 100 grams today
   -daily albumin
   -will need re paracentesis at some point, now especially if unable to
   wean from pressors.
   -f/u hepatology recs
   .
   ## ? UTI; started on empiric ciprofloxacin yesterday; urine culture
   negative, however
   - recheck UA and culture
   - continue Zosyn
   .
   # Anemia: potentially dilutional but concern in the setting of acute
   sepsis. Patient also has thrombocytopenia, and elevated coags. Patient
   also has serosanguinous drainage via chest tube.
   -monitor [**Hospital1 **] HCT. Transfuse to keep HCT>24
   -speak with neurosurg re: post-surgical transfusion criteria
   -guiaiac stools
   .
   ## FEN: NPO for now; nutrition consult for tube feed recs if need for
   intubation persists
   ## DVT Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   ## Access: right PICC, one PIV, right radial arterial line
   ## Code: full
   ## Communication: complicated social situation; per last SW note,
   mother planning to sign HCP forms; need to f/u with SW to see what the
   status of this is.  Daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6254**] [**Doctor First Name **].
   ## Dispo: pending resolution of respiratory failure, acidosis, renal
   failure; critically ill

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   acute respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Given right lobar collapse, likely secondary to
   mucus plugging. CXR this AM demonstrates improved aeration s/p
   bronchoscopy. Respiratory mechanics are also impared given persistent
   right sided effusion and ascites, although ABG overnight (7.28/36/105)
   demonstrates adequate oxygenation on FiO2 40%.
   -  RSBI this AM <100, consider PS trial and extubation if tolerates.
   - Thoracics/IP input appreciated regarding chest tube and recent
   pleurodeses
   - F/u sputum and BAL culture data.
   - Per thoracics, CT placed to water seal. Request for repeat CXR this
   PM.
   - Hold off on therapeutic paracentesis given HRS.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to ARF 2/2 HRS with
   most recent lactate <2.
   - Follow-up renal and liver recs
   - Continue midodrine, octreotide, SPA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial with contributing etiologies
   including sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal
   insufficiency. Unlikely to be sepsis given broad specturm antibiotics
   since [**5-20**].  Patient now off levophed.
   - Continue hydrocort 50 mg Q6H
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - SBT
   - Hold nadolol and hydralazine.
   - TTE given anterior mediastinal hematoma and diffusely low voltage on
   ECG.
   .
   # HAP: Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**5-20**].
   - Continue antimicrobial therapy for now. Will consider discontinuing
   in 48 hours if culture negative and patient stable.
   - F/u culture data
   - Follow-up ID recs if any
   .
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS. Patient
   oliguric with increasing BUN/creatinine.
   - Continue (though unlikely to have much effect when not getting
   nutrition) for hyperphosphatemia
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine, and albumin.
   - Follow up nephrology and liver recs.
   - Recheck creatinine and lytes this PM.
   - Trend creatinine, if renal function continues to worsen, will likely
   require family meeting as HD unlikely to help in HRS.
   .
   # T4 mass/lesion: F/u neurosurgery recs if any.
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Appreciate hepatology input.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine, and albumin
   - Holding nadolol given hypotension overnight.
   - F/u hepatology recs
   .
   # ? UTI: UA with pyuria (WBC>200) yesterday. UCx pending, UCx ([**4-25**])
   negative with pyuria then as well.  Less likely to be UTI given
   prolonged course of pip/tazo.
   - Continue pip/tazo as above.
   - F/u UCx
   - Change foley catheter.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable
   -Trend HCT. Transfuse to keep HCT>24

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   acute respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Given right lobar collapse, likely secondary to
   mucus plugging. CXR this AM demonstrates improved aeration s/p
   bronchoscopy. Respiratory mechanics are also impared given persistent
   right sided effusion and ascties, although ABG overnight (7.28/36/105)
   demonstrates adequate oxygenation on FiO2 40%.
   -  RSBI this AM <100, consider PS trial and extubation if tolerates.
   - Thoracics/IP input appreciated regarding chest tube and recent
   pleurodeses
   - F/u sputum and BAL culture data.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to ARF 2/2 HRS with
   most recent lactate <2.
   - Follow-up renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial with contributing etiologies
   including sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal
   insufficiency. Unlikely to be sepsis given broad specturm antibiotics
   since [**5-20**].
   - Continue IV solumedrol 60mg Q8H
   - Wean sedation
   - PS trial as above
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.
   - Hold nadolol and hydralazine.
   - TTE given anterior mediastinal hematoma and diffusely low voltage on
   ECG.
   .
   # HAP: Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**5-20**].
   - Hold antimicrobial therapy.
   - Follow-up ID recs if any
   .
   ## Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS.
   - Continue (though unlikely to have much effect when not getting
   nutrition) for hyperphosphatemia
   - Continue octreotide for suspected hepatorenal syndrome. Hold
   midodrine while on pressors
   - Continue albumin 12.5grams [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow up nephrology and liver recs.
   - Trend creatinine, if renal function continues to worsen, will likely
   require family meeting as HD unlikely to help in HRS.
   .
   # T4 mass/lesion
   - goal platelets >70k per neurosurgery given recent spinal surgery
   - dexamethasone (for cord compression) being tapered
   .
   # Cirrhosis
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - hold midodrine, give octreotide (as above) for suspected hepatorenal
   syndrome
   - holding nadolol
   - Albumin 100 grams today
   - Daily albumin
   - Will need re paracentesis at some point, now especially if unable to
   wean from pressors.
   - F/u hepatology recs
   .
   # ? UTI: UA with pyuria (WBC>200) yesterday. UCx pending, UCx ([**4-25**])
   negative with pyuria then as well.  Unlikely to be UTI given prolonged
   course of pip/tazo.
   - Hold antimicrobials.
   - F/u UCx
   .
   # Anemia: potentially dilutional but concern in the setting of acute
   sepsis. Patient also has thrombocytopenia, and elevated coags. Patient
   also has serosanguinous drainage via chest tube.
   -monitor [**Hospital1 **] HCT. Transfuse to keep HCT>24
   -speak with neurosurg re: post-surgical transfusion criteria
   -guiaiac stools
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now; nutrition consult for tube feed recs if need for
   intubation persists
   .
   # DVT Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of right lobar collapse and pleural effusion. There is ongoing concern about respiratory mechanics being impaired due to the effusion and ascites. The patient's ABG results show adequate oxygenation on FiO2 40%. The RSBI is mentioned as being below 100, suggesting the possibility of extubation if the patient tolerates a pressure support trial.

2. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: This is likely secondary to acute renal failure (ARF) due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The lactate level is mentioned as being less than 2. Follow-up renal and liver recommendations are advised.

3. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which is likely multifactorial. Contributing factors include sedation, positive pressure ventilation, adrenal insufficiency, and other causes. The plan includes continuing IV solumedrol, weaning sedation, starting a pressure support trial, and weaning pressors as tolerated.

4. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient has worsening oliguric renal failure, and there are suspicions of HRS. Octreotide is being given for suspected HRS, and midodrine is being held while on pressors. Follow-up nephrology and liver recommendations are advised.

5. T4 mass/lesion:"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   and today with acute respiratory failure during bronchoscopy.  Now with
   new hypotension requiring low-dose of vasopressor support.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure; seems to have been an acute event in the
   setting of bronchoscopy for mucous plugging; respiratory mechanics
   further impaired by large pleural effusion and persistent ascites.  In
   spite of this, however, she is actually oxygenating quite well.
   - wean sedation overnight with the goal of assessing for possible
   extubation in the morning
   - thoracics/IP input appreciated regarding chest tube and recent
   pleurodeses
   -thoracics posed idea of repeat bronchoscopy this AM, with concern for
   mucus plugging. MICU will consider further bronchoscopy.
   - completed course of vancomycin and pip/tazo for suspected VAP; f/u
   BAL results
   .
   ## Anion gap metabolic acidosis; renal function is certainly
   contributing:
   - check repeat electrolytes with lactate now; check blood cultures
   - renal following
   .
   ## Hypotension; may be due to sedation and positive pressure
   ventillation. Concern for sepsis in this setting as well.
   -f/u vanc level
   -continue zosyn broad gram - coverage
   - blood cultures now from PICC and peripheral stick
   - wean phenylephrine and propofol as tolerated
   - hold nadolol and hydralazine
   - TTE given anterior mediastinal hematoma and diffusely low voltage on
   ECG
   -infectious disease consulted. Follow up recs.
   .
   ## Acute renal failure/oliguria- ATN to hepatorenal
   - start sevelamer (though unlikely to have much effect when not getting
   nutrition) for hyperphosphatemia
   - discontinue acyclovir (per T-SICU team, this was initially started
   out of concern for herpetic labial lesions while on steroids)
   - continue octreotide for suspected hepatorenal syndrome. Hold
   midodrine while on pressors, albumin
   -follow up nephrology recs, especially re: dialysis
   .
   ## T4 mass/lesion
   - goal platelets >70k per neurosurgery given recent spinal surgery
   - dexamethasone (for cord compression) being tapered
   .
   ## Cirrhosis
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - hold midodrine, give octreotide (as above) for suspected hepatorenal
   syndrome
   - holding nadolol
   -albumin 100 grams today
   -daily albumin
   -will need re paracentesis at some point, now especially if unable to
   wean from pressors.
   -f/u hepatology recs
   .
   ## ? UTI; started on empiric ciprofloxacin yesterday; urine culture
   negative, however
   - recheck UA and culture
   - continue Zosyn
   .
   # Anemia: potentially dilutional but concern in the setting of acute
   sepsis. Patient also has thrombocytopenia, and elevated coags. Patient
   also has serosanguinous drainage via chest tube.
   -monitor [**Hospital1 **] HCT. Transfuse to keep HCT>24
   -speak with neurosurg re: post-surgical transfusion criteria
   -guiaiac stools
   .
   ## FEN: NPO for now; nutrition consult for tube feed recs if need for
   intubation persists
   ## DVT Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   ## Access: right PICC, one PIV, right radial arterial line
   ## Code: full
   ## Communication: complicated social situation; per last SW note,
   mother planning to sign HCP forms; need to f/u with SW to see what the
   status of this is.  Daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6254**] [**Doctor First Name **].

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and today with acute respiratory failure during bronchoscopy. She now presents with hypotension requiring low-dose vasopressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced acute respiratory failure during bronchoscopy, which may be due to impaired respiratory mechanics caused by a large pleural effusion and persistent ascites. The plan is to wean sedation overnight and assess for possible extubation in the morning.
2. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely contributing to renal failure. Further evaluation is needed, including repeat electrolytes with lactate, check blood cultures, and follow-up renal function.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sedation and positive pressure ventilation, as well as concern for sepsis. The plan includes weaning phenylephrine and propofol as tolerated, checking vancomycin levels, continuing broad gram coverage, obtaining blood cultures, and holding nadolol and hydralazine.
4. Acute Renal Failure/Oliguria: The patient has acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   acute respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient failed SBT yesterday secondary to
   inadequate ventilation.  Secondary to right lobar collapse due to mucus
   plugging. CXR this AM demonstrates improved aeration s/p bronchoscopy.
   Respiratory mechanics are also impared given persistent right sided
   effusion and ascties.  ABG 7.33/32/162 overnight.  RSBI 32 this AM.
   - SBT today, consider extubation today if tolerates.
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to ARF 2/2 HRS with
   most recent lactate <2.  Patient continues to be oliguric with rising
   creatinine and BUN. Potassium stable on lactulose.  Given the acute
   change in renal function, this is likely type 1 HRS suggesting that the
   patient would not benefit from bridging with HD/CVVH.
   - Follow-up renal and liver recs
   - Trend creatinine, lytes.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient >24 hours off pressors.  Likely multifactorial
   with contributing etiologies including sedation, positive pressure
   ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Unlikely to be sepsis given
   broad specturm antibiotics since [**5-20**].
   - Continue IV solumedrol 60mg Q8H
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - SBT as above
   - Hold nadolol and hydralazine.
   .
   # HAP: Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**5-20**].
   - Continue antimicrobial therapy for an additional 24 hours. If not
   culture data at that time, plan to d/c.
   - Follow-up ID recs if any
   .
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS.
   - Aluminum hydroxide x  3 days per renal
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine, and albumin.
   - Follow up nephrology and liver recs.
   - Trend creatinine and lytes. As above, if renal function continues to
   worsen, will likely require family meeting as HD unlikely to help in
   HRS.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis and complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. She underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. The post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday due to inadequate ventilation, secondary to right lobar collapse caused by mucus plugging. However, the recent chest X-ray shows improved aeration following bronchoscopy. Respiratory mechanics are also impaired due to the persistent right-sided effusion and ascites. ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. If the patient tolerates a repeat SBT, extubation may be considered.
2. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: This is likely secondary to acute renal failure (ARF) due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient continues to be oliguric with rising creatinine and BUN levels. Lactate levels are low, suggesting type 1 HRS, which means that hemodialysis (HD) or continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) may not be beneficial.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been off pressors for more than 24 hours, and the hypotension is likely multifactorial. Contributing factors include sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and possible adrenal insufficiency. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have already been administered, making sepsis less likely.
4. Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS): This condition is characterized by the triad of liver disease, increased alveolar-arterial gradient, and intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. The patient's history of cirrhosis and respiratory failure raises the possibility of HPS.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's worsening oliguric renal failure is likely secondary to HRS. Treatment options include aluminum hydroxide, octreotide, midodrine, and albumin. If renal function continues to worsen, a family meeting may be necessary to discuss the lack of benefit from HD in HRS.
6. T4 mass/lesion: The patient had a destructive T4 lesion for which she underwent vertebrectomy and spinal fusion. Further follow-up with neurosurgery may be required.
7. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis with complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. Management includes lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, octreotide, midodrine, and albumin for hepatorenal syndrome, and holding nadolol due to hypotension.
8. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although less likely given the prolonged course of antibiotics, the patient's urine analysis showed pyuria. Further follow-up with urine cultures is necessary.
9. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down, indicating the need for close monitoring and possible transfusion if the hemoglobin falls below 21 or if there are signs of end-organ damage.
10. Other considerations include communication and social issues, as well as the need for a family meeting to discuss the patient's code status and disposition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   acute respiratory failure, and hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient failed SBT yesterday secondary to
   inadequate ventilation.  Secondary to right lobar collapse due to mucus
   plugging. CXR this AM demonstrates improved aeration s/p bronchoscopy.
   Respiratory mechanics are also impaired given persistent right sided
   effusion and ascites.  ABG 7.33/32/162 overnight.  RSBI 32 this AM.
   - PS trial today. Patient will be difficult to extubated successfully
   given ascites, effusion, and metabolic acidosis [**2-20**] renal failure.
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to ARF 2/2 HRS with
   most recent lactate <2.  Patient continues to be oliguric with rising
   creatinine and BUN. Potassium stable on lactulose.  Given the acute
   change in renal function, this is likely type 1 HRS suggesting that the
   patient would not benefit from bridging with HD/CVVH.
   - Follow-up renal and liver recs
   - Trend creatinine, lytes.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient >24 hours off pressors.  Likely multifactorial
   with contributing etiologies including sedation, positive pressure
   ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Unlikely to be sepsis given
   broad specturm antibiotics since [**5-20**].
   - Continue hydrocortisone 25 Q6H
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - PS trial as above
   - Hold nadolol and hydralazine.
   .
   # HAP: Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**5-20**].
   - BAL negative. Hold antimicrobials.
   - Follow-up ID recs if any
   .
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS.
   - Aluminum hydroxide x  3 days per renal
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine.
   - Follow up nephrology and liver recs.  Check with liver regarding
   continuing SPA.
   - Trend creatinine and lytes. As above, if renal function continues to
   worsen, will likely require family meeting as HD unlikely to help in
   HRS.
   .
   # T4 mass/lesion
   - Follow-up neurosurg recs if any.
   .
   # Cirrhosis
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine.
   - Holding nadolol given hypotension overnight.
   - F/u hepatology recs if any.
   .
   # ? UTI: UA with pyuria (WBC>200) yesterday. UCx pending, UCx ([**4-25**])
   negative with pyuria then as well.  Less likely to be UTI given
   prolonged course of pip/tazo. Urine culture only positive for yeast.
   - Hold antimicrobials as above.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct trending down this AM to 24.7 from 28 yesterday.
   - Trend hct Q12H. Transfuse for hct<21 or if signs of end organ damage.
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   FEN: TF, replete as necessary.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including cirrhosis, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, and a T4 lesion. She has undergone multiple procedures and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and oliguric renal failure. She has also had a recent T4 lesion that required vertebroplasty and spinal fusion.

The potential medical complications that can arise include ongoing respiratory failure due to impaired respiratory mechanics and persistent right-sided pleural effusion. The patient may continue to be difficult to extubate successfully given ascites, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure.

There is also an ongoing anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to acute renal failure due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient is oliguric with rising creatinine and BUN. Potassium remains stable on lactulose. Given the acute change in renal function, this is likely type 1 HRS, suggesting that the patient would not benefit from bridging with hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration.

Hypotension persists, likely multifactorial with contributing etiologies including sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. It is unlikely to be sepsis given the broad spectrum of antibiotics administered.

There is also a possibility of hepatic artery"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension requiring low-dose
   levophed.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient failed SBT yesterday secondary to
   inadequate ventilation.  Secondary to right lobar collapse due to mucus
   plugging. CXR demonstrates improved aeration s/p bronchoscopy.
   Respiratory mechanics are also impaired given persistent right sided
   effusion and ascites.  ABG 7.33/32/162 overnight.  RSBI 32 this AM.
   - PS trial today. Patient will be difficult to extubate successfully
   given ascites, effusion, and metabolic acidosis [**2-20**] renal failure.
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to ARF 2/2 HRS with
   most recent lactate <2.  Patient continues to be oliguric with rising
   creatinine and BUN. Potassium stable on lactulose.  Given the acute
   change in renal function, this is likely type 1 HRS suggesting that the
   patient would not benefit from bridging with HD/CVVH.
   - Follow-up renal and liver recs
   - Trend creatinine, lytes.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient >24 hours off pressors.  Likely multifactorial
   with contributing etiologies including sedation, positive pressure
   ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Unlikely to be sepsis given
   broad specturm antibiotics since [**5-20**].
   - Continue hydrocortisone 25 Q6H
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - PS trial as above
   - Hold nadolol and hydralazine.
   .
   # HAP: Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**2130-5-20**].
   - BAL negative. Hold antimicrobials.
   - Follow-up ID recs if any
   .
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS.
   - Aluminum hydroxide x  3 days per renal
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine.
   - Follow up nephrology and liver recs.  Check with liver regarding
   continuing SPA.
   - Trend creatinine and lytes. As above, if renal function continues to
   worsen, will likely require family meeting as HD unlikely to help in
   HRS.
   .
   # T4 mass/lesion
   - Follow-up neurosurg recs if any.
   .
   # Cirrhosis
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Holding nadolol given hypotension overnight.
   - F/u hepatology recs if any.
   .
   # ? UTI: UA with pyuria (WBC>200) yesterday. UCx pending, UCx ([**4-25**])
   negative with pyuria then as well.  Less likely to be UTI given
   prolonged course of pip/tazo. Urine culture only positive for yeast.
   - Hold antimicrobials as above.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct trending down this AM to 24.7 from 28 yesterday.
   - Trend hct Q12H. Transfuse for hct<21 or if signs of end organ damage.
   - Guaiac stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by several conditions including right-sided pleural effusion, worsening oliguric renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to inadequate ventilation, likely secondary to right lobar collapse caused by mucus plugging. This is supported by the improvement in aeration seen on the chest X-ray after bronchoscopy. The patient also has impaired respiratory mechanics due to persistent right-sided effusion and ascites. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.33, indicating metabolic acidosis. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 32, which suggests that the patient will be difficult to extubate successfully.

2. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: This is likely secondary to acute renal failure (ARF) due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) with a recent lactate level less than 2. The patient continues to be oliguric with rising creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Potassium remains stable on lactulose. Given the acute change in renal function, this is likely type 1 HRS,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis who underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. She has had a complicated post-operative course including persistent right-sided pleural effusion, worsening oliguric renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressures support ventilation (PSV). She is also receiving hydrocortisone due to suspected adrenal insufficiency and has ongoing issues with acid-base balance, hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), potential urinary tract infection (UTI), and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory mechanics continue to be impaired due to pleural effusion and refractory ascites, which may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Acid-base imbalance: The patient has anion-gap metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure and respiratory acidosis. This imbalance needs to be closely monitored and adjusted appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial and could be due to sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring and managing blood pressure is crucial.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely secondary to HRS. Hemodialysis (HD) has been planned, and the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension requiring low-dose
   levophed.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient on PSV yesterday until mid-afternoon
   with periods of apnea noted per RT. Respiratory mechanics continue to
   be impaired secondary to pleural effusion and refractory ascites in
   conjunction with anion-gap metabolic acidosis from ARF. ABG overnight
   7.24/44/170.
   - PSV trial today.
   - Plan for HD today, which may help in managing volume status aiding in
   eventual prolonged extubation.
   .
   # Acid-base balance: Most recent ABG 7.24/44/170/18, suggesting AG
   metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.
   - Repeat ABG today, adjust vent settings to reduce CO2
   - Trend creatinine and lytes.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient >48 hours off pressors.  Likely multifactorial
   with contributing etiologies including sedation, positive pressure
   ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Unlikely to be sepsis given
   broad specturm antibiotics since [**5-20**].
   - Continue hydrocortisone 25 Q6H
   - Restart nadolol, hold hydralazine
   .
   # HAP: Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**5-20**] and discontinued on [**5-30**].
   - Hold antimicrobials.
   .
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS.  Family
   meeting yesterday, patient and family wishes to purse HD.
   - IR guided temp HD line today, then HD
   - Aluminum hydroxide x3 days (day [**2-21**]) per renal
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine, and SPA.
   - Follow up nephrology and liver recs.
   - Trend creatinine and lytes.

   # ? UTI: UA with pyuria (WBC>200) yesterday. UCx pending, UCx ([**4-25**])
   negative with pyuria then as well.  Less likely to be UTI given
   prolonged course of pip/tazo. Urine culture only positive for yeast.
   - Hold antimicrobials as above.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history including cirrhosis, ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. She underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to impaired respiratory mechanics caused by pleural effusion and refractory ascites. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure is also present.
- Acid-base balance: The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows an anion-gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. Further ABG analysis and adjustment of ventilator settings are planned to reduce carbon dioxide levels.
- Hypotension: The patient is off pressors for more than 48 hours. Possible contributing factors include sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone is being continued, and nadolol has been restarted while holding hydralazine.
- Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAP): Broad-spectrum antibiotics (pip/tazo) and vancomycin were started on [**5-20**] and discontinued on [**5-30**]. Antimicrobials are being held.
- Acute renal failure/oliguria: This is likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). A family meeting was held, and the patient and family have agreed to pursue hemodialysis (HD). An interventional radiology (IR)-guided temporary HD line will be placed today, followed by HD. Aluminum hydroxide will be administered for three days, and octreotide, midodrine, and spironolactone (SPA) will be continued. Follow-up with nephrology and liver recommendations is planned.
- T4 mass/lesion: Neurosurgery recommendations will be followed if any.
- Cirrhosis: Lactulose and rifaximin will be continued, and nadolol will be restarted. Hepatology recommendations will be followed if any.
- Urinary tract infection (UTI): A urinalysis with pyuria was noted yesterday, but urine culture only showed yeast. Antimicrobials will be held.
- Anemia: The hematocrit (Hct) is trending down to 23.7. Hct will be monitored every 12 hours, and transfusion will be considered for Hct less than 21 or signs of end-organ damage. Guaiac stools will also be monitored.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
- Heart rate: 68 bpm (range"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who has undergone anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. She has had a complicated post-operative course including persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to pleural effusion and refractory ascites. There have been periods of apnea noted, indicating ongoing respiratory distress.

2. Acid-base balance: The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results show anion-gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. Adjustments to the ventilator settings may be necessary to reduce carbon dioxide levels. Monitoring of trends in creatinine and electrolytes is also important.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been off pressors for more than 48 hours, but still experiences episodes of hypotension. Contributing factors include sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone is being continued, and nadolol has been restarted while hydralazine has been held.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. She has had a complicated post-operative course, including persistent right-sided pleural effusion, worsening oliguric renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension requiring low-dose levophed.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has impaired respiratory mechanics due to pleural effusion and refractory ascites. She also has anion-gap metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure.

Her current medications include lactulose and rifaximin for cirrhosis, octreotide and midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and discontinuation of spa. She is also receiving aluminum hydroxide for renal protection.

The patient has a low hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 21.4%, which is trending down, likely due to hematoma and an intra-arterial procedure. She received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfusion.

She is stable for now, with no ongoing hypotension or infection concerns. However, her condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications, including respiratory failure, cirrhosis, acute renal failure, anemia, hypotension, hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension requiring low-dose
   levophed.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient on PSV yesterday until mid-afternoon
   with periods of apnea noted per RT. Respiratory mechanics continue to
   be impaired secondary to pleural effusion and refractory ascites in
   conjunction with anion-gap metabolic acidosis from ARF. ABG overnight
   7.24/44/170.
   - PSV trial today.
   - Plan for HD today, which may help in managing volume status aiding in
   eventual prolonged extubation.
   - Large volume paracentesis prior to procedure.
   # Acid-base balance: Most recent ABG 7.24/44/170/18, suggesting AG
   metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis.
   - Repeat ABG today, adjust vent settings to reduce CO2
   - Trend creatinine and lytes.
   # Hypotension: Patient >48 hours off pressors.  Likely multifactorial
   with contributing etiologies including sedation, positive pressure
   ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Unlikely to be sepsis given
   broad specturm antibiotics since [**5-20**].
   - Continue hydrocortisone 25 Q6H
   - Hold nadolol and hydralazine given fluid shifts from HD.
   # HAP: Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**5-20**] and discontinued on [**5-30**].
   - Continue to hold antimicrobials.
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS.  Family
   meeting yesterday, patient and family wishes to purse HD.
   - IR guided temp HD line today, then HD
   - Aluminum hydroxide x3 days (day [**2-21**]) per renal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. She has had a complicated post-operative course, including persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension. Currently, the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PSV mode. She has impaired respiratory mechanics due to pleural effusion and refractory ascites, as well as anion-gap metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory mechanics are impaired, and she has an ongoing pleural effusion, which can further compromise her lung function.
2. Acid-base balance: The patient has an anion-gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. It is necessary to monitor and adjust ventilation settings to reduce carbon dioxide levels and manage the acid-base imbalance.
3. Hypotension: The patient is off pressors for more than 48 hours but remains hypotensive. Possible contributing factors include sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. It is important to continue monitoring and managing her blood pressure.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis, which increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin should be"

","The patient is a 79 kg, 66-inch male with a current weight of 7.4 kg. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. On the previous day, a temporary hemodialysis (HD) line was placed and the patient underwent HD without hypotension. The patient continues to receive midodrine and octreotide. Today, the patient experienced bleeding from an arterial line and a hematoma at the site of the temporary HD line placement. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 25 micrograms of desmopressin (DDAVP).

The patient is sedated and intubated. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 60 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has decreased breath sounds over the right lung field diffusely and a chest tube draining serosanguinous fluid from the right anterior chest. The patient also has a median sternotomy incision without erythema or drainage. There is evidence of distended abdomen and 2+ edema in the extremities with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension requiring low-dose
   levophed.
   # Respiratory failure: Currently on AC. Respiratory mechanics continue
   to be impaired secondary to pleural effusion and refractory ascites in
   conjunction with anion-gap metabolic acidosis from ARF.
   - ABGs and adjust vent accordingly. PSV trial if possible.
   - Plan for HD today, to manage volume status
   # Cirrhosis
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol.
   - F/u hepatology recs if any.
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS.
   - IR guided temp HD line today, complicated by hematoma
   - Aluminum hydroxide x3 days (day [**3-21**]) per renal
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine, discontinue SPA
   - Follow up nephrology and liver recs.
   - Trend creatinine and lytes.
   # AGMA and respiratory acidosis (mild):
   - AGMA attributed to ARF/HRS and expect improvement with HD.
   - Follow ABGs
   # Anemia: Hct trending down this AM to 21; likely [**2-20**] hematoma and IR
   procedure. S/P 1x pRBC
   - Trend hct Q12H. Transfuse for hct<21 or if signs of end organ damage.
   - Guaiac stools
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial with contributing etiologies
   including sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - Resolved; >3 days off pressors.
   # HAP: s/p Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**5-20**] and discontinued on [**5-30**].
   - Continue to hold antimicrobials.
   # T4 mass/lesion
   - Follow-up neurosurg recs if any.
   # ? UTI: UA with pyuria (WBC>200) yesterday. UCx pending, UCx ([**4-25**])
   negative with pyuria then as well.  Less likely to be UTI given
   prolonged course of pip/tazo. Urine culture only positive for yeast.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Lastname 643] is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion due to a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and transient hypotension.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to have impaired respiratory mechanics due to pleural effusion and refractory ascites, along with anion-gap metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure (ARF). ABGs should be monitored, and adjustments to ventilation should be made accordingly. A trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) may be considered if possible.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis should be managed with lactulose and rifaximin. Nadolol should be discontinued, and hepatology recommendations should be followed up if any.

3. Acute renal failure/oliguria: This is likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Temporary hemodialysis (HD) line placement was complicated by a hematoma, but ongoing HD should help manage volume status. Aluminum hydroxide should be administered for renal protection, and octreotide and midodrine should be continued. Discontinue spa, and follow up with nephrology and liver recommendations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   and acute respiratory failure.
    #Hemothorax: Patient became hypotensive and tachycardic overnight with
   bleeding from old chest tube sites. Concern for hemothorax given
   complete opacification of R lung on chest x-ray that did not resolve
   with bronch. Crit 21.4 from 20 after two units with dialysis. R chest
   tube placed with 1600 ccs blood returned. Given 2 u pRBCs, 1 u FFP, 1 u
   cryo, DDAVP, and IVF with continued bleeding. Bronchoscopy performed by
   thoracic surgery which demonstrated no mucus plugging. Patient take to
   the OR to for exploration to evaluate source of bleed. Received
   multiple blood products in OR, however definitive source not
   identified. Two additional chest tubes were placed prior to return to
   floor.
   - F/u CT output
   - Monitor CXR for signs of reaccumulation
   - F/u thoracic recs
   - q6h crits
   - T&C for 4 units
   - F/u coags
   - Hold SQH
   # Respiratory failure: Currently on AC following operative procedure.
   Tolerated SBT well yesterday, however given acute events yesterday will
   maintain current settings while allowing patient to stabilize in
   setting of volume overload and recent procedures.
   - Follow ABGs
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Likely secondary to HRS. Received
   dialysis [**6-1**].
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine,
   - Sevelamer carbmate and calcium
   - Follow up nephrology and liver recs
   - Trend creatinine and lytes.
   # Cirrhosis
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol.
   - F/u hepatology recs
   # HAP: s/p Pip/tazo and vanco started on [**5-20**] and discontinued on [**5-30**].
   - Continue to hold antimicrobials.
   # T4 mass/lesion
   - Follow-up neurosurg recs if any.
   # ? UTI: UA with pyuria (WBC>200) yesterday. UCx pending, UCx ([**4-25**])
   negative with pyuria then as well.  Less likely to be UTI given
   prolonged course of pip/tazo. Urine culture only positive for yeast.
   - Hold antimicrobials as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion.
- Post-operatively, the patient experienced persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.
- Overnight, the patient became hypotensive and tachycardic with bleeding from old chest tube sites, leading to a concern for hemothorax.
- A chest tube was placed and returned 1600 ccs of blood. The patient received multiple blood products but the source of bleeding was not identified during an exploration in the operating room.
- Additional chest tubes were placed before returning to the floor.
- The patient is currently on assisted ventilation and is being monitored closely for signs of reaccumulation of the hemothorax and respiratory failure.
- The patient also has acute renal failure/oliguria, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
- Treatment includes continuing octreotide and midodrine, as well as monitoring liver function tests.
- Other ongoing concerns include cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and potential urinary tract infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Continued bleeding/hemothorax: The patient experienced significant bleeding from the chest tube"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   and acute respiratory failure.
    #Hemothorax: Patient became hypotensive and tachycardic overnight with
   bleeding from old chest tube sites. Concern for hemothorax given
   complete opacification of R lung on chest x-ray that did not resolve
   with bronch. Crit 21.4 from 20 after two units with dialysis. R chest
   tube placed with 1600 ccs blood returned. Given 2 u pRBCs, 1 u FFP, 1 u
   cryo, DDAVP, and IVF with continued bleeding. Bronchoscopy performed by
   thoracic surgery which demonstrated no mucus plugging. Patient take to
   the OR to evaluate for source of bleed. Received multiple blood
   products in OR, however definitive source not identified. Two
   additional chest tubes were placed prior to return to floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 643] is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use, presenting with ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. She underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course was complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Hemothorax: The patient became hypotensive and tachycardic overnight with bleeding from old chest tube sites. There is concern for hemothorax given the complete opacification of the right lung on chest X-ray that did not resolve with bronchoscopy. The patient's hematocrit decreased from 20 to 21.4 after receiving two units of packed red blood cells. A right chest tube was placed, and 1600 ccs of blood were returned. The patient received additional blood products, but the source of the bleed was not identified. Two additional chest tubes were placed before returning to the floor.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on assisted ventilation due to impaired respiratory mechanics caused by pleural effusion and refractory ascites in conjunction with anion-gap metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:

1. Hemothorax: The patient has had ongoing chest tube drainage with significant output of serosanguinous fluid. She has received multiple blood product transfusions to manage her low hemoglobin levels and continues to bleed. The etiology of the hemothorax is uncertain, but it may be related to her hepatothorax.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the acute hemothorax. Her ventilator settings have been adjusted to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Acute Renal Failure/Oliguria: The patient's acute renal failure is suspected to be due to hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1). She has received dialysis and is being treated with octreotide and midodrine to improve renal perfusion.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin to control hepatic encephalopathy. Nadolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, has been held due to the patient's acute renal failure"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 643] is a 45-year-old woman with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, complications of which include ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. She underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Hemothorax: The patient has required multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to persistent hemothorax. Three chest tubes on the right are continuing to drain serosanguinous fluid. The etiology of the continued hemothorax is uncertain and may be related to a hepatothorax component as well. Further diagnostic measures, such as trend CT output and recheck chest X-ray, are planned to assess for reaccumulation of fluid. The patient's platelet count has decreased significantly, indicating the need for platelet transfusion.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is stable without increasing ventilatory requirements. Acute hemothorax is a contributing factor to her respiratory failure. ABG trends and pulmonary function testing (PSV) will be monitored.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is being switched to hydrocortisone therapy today.

4. Acute Renal Failure/Oliguria: The"

1. Hemothorax: The patient has a right-sided pleural effusion and is at risk of reaccumulation. Close monitoring of chest tube output and rechecking CXR for reaccumulation is necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient self-extubated and is now experiencing increasing PCO2 levels. Continuous monitoring of ABG and oxygenation, as well as weaning supplemental O2 as tolerated, is recommended.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is on hydrocortisone IV BID, and consideration should be given to switching to oral hydrocortisone when the patient tolerates diet and begin tapering.

4. Acute renal failure/oliguria: The patient has secondary hepatic respiratory syndrome (HRS) type 1 and has received dialysis. Continuing octreotide and midodrine, following up with nephrology for HD, and trending creatinine and lytes are important.

5. Confusion: The patient's confusion may be due to pCO2 retention. ABG should be done, and alternative etiologies such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) should be considered if ABG is normal and the patient does not improve.

Ms. [**Known lastname 643**], a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, encephalopathy, and varices, is currently admitted to the ICU for her post-operative course following an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her recent medical events include persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. She self-extubated yesterday and is now experiencing increasing carbon dioxide levels. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 111/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has been transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and has received multiple blood product transfusions over the past 24 hours. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR). She also has abnormal liver function tests, elevated lactate levels, and low albumin levels. 

Assessment and Plan:

- The post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.
- The patient has experienced hemothorax, with a worsening right-sided effusion and strikethrough on dressings. She has received multiple transfusions overnight.
- She also has respiratory failure but did well after self-extubation.
- The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and is receiving hydrocortisone IV BID.
- She is also dealing with acute renal failure/oliguria, classified as HRS type 1.
- Other ongoing issues include cirrhosis, a T4 mass/lesion, and the need for follow-up hepatology and neurosurgery recommendations.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is ICU level of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to her history of cirrhosis and ongoing liver dysfunction, the patient may experience worsening mental"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of a hemothorax. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including pain management, respiratory support, and nutritional support. The patient's condition is complicated by acute respiratory failure, impaired muscle performance, impaired skin integrity, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, and a history of hemothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, as indicated by the need for oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and an ABG indicating respiratory acidosis. This places the patient at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Impaired Muscle Performance: The patient's impaired muscle performance may be due to immobility or underlying muscle damage. This increases the risk of muscle atrophy, pressure ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for pressure ulcers, which can be difficult to manage and may lead to infection.

4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium levels can result in symptoms such as muscle cramps, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias. It needs to be monitored and treated promptly to prevent complications.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels can cause neurological symptoms and, if left untreated,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79 kg, 66-inch adult male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is an arterial line stop, which occurred at 11:48 AM. The arterial line was pulled back post chest tube 4 cm, and the patient received a transfusion of 1 unit platelets and WinRho, as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient self-disconnected from the arterial line and advanced to a clear liquid diet, followed by a pureed diet. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and received cefazolin at 02:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions. There are no changes to the patient's medical or family history. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the arterial line stop. 

Flowsheet data as of 07:12 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 45/26 mmHg to 149/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient's weight is currently 7.4 kg, and the admission weight was 79 kg. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,680 mL, with 378 mL going through the nasogastric (NG) tube, 520 mL through the oral (PO) route, and 241 mL through intravenous fluids (IVF). Total output includes 4,580 mL through urine, 850 mL through chest tube drainage, and 472 mL through NG drainage, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 2,900 mL. 

The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 106 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 23 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -2 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 96%. 

Physical examination reveals a somnolent patient with no scleral icterus, neck supple without lymphadenopathy, decreased breath sounds over the right lung field diffusely, and three chest tubes in place. The cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, regurgitation, or gallop. The abdomen is soft and distended, with 2+ peripheral edema and 1+ diminished pulses in the lower extremities. The skin examination shows no rashes or ja"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 643**] is a 45 year old woman with CPC 2 EtOH cirrhosis c/b
   ascites, encephalopathy, and varices now s/p anterior-approach
   vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for destructive T4 lesion with
   post-operative course complicated by persistent right-sided pleural
   effusion requiring pleurodesis x2, worsening oliguric renal failure,
   and acute respiratory failure.
   # Hemothorax: Patient required 2 units PRBC yesterday.  Platelets and
   INR stable. Hct continues to trend down with possible reaccumulation on
   CXR.
   - Right sided CXR and cross table this AM per thoracics
   - Monitor CT output.
   - Transfuse 1 u prbc and 1 plt. Check CBC Q6H, transfuse for hct<25
   - Recheck CXR this PM for reaccumulation
   - Active T+S
   - Check ionized calcium levels and aggressively replete as necessary.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient self extubated yesterday now with
   incresaing PCO2. Oxygenation stable on 2L nc.
   - Check ABG, if patient is retaining concerning for tiring.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>92%
   .
   # Adrenal insufficiency: Switched to hydrocortisone IV BID ([**6-3**]). Can
   consider switching to PO when tolerating diet and begin taper.
   .
   # Acute renal failure/oliguria: Secondary to HRS type 1. Received
   dialysis [**6-1**], [**6-2**], and [**6-3**]
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine
   - Sevelamer carbmate and calcium
   - Follow up nephrology re HD today given product volume.
   - Trend creatinine and lytes.
   .
   # Confusion: Patient more confused this morning in setting of ativan
   yesterday and continued sedation overnight.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be secondary to
   pCO2 retention.  If ABG ok and patient does not improve, will need to
   consider alternative etiologies including SBP.
   - ABG
   - Consider diagnostic paracetnesis.
   - Limit benzos and sedating meds as patient unlikely to be able to
   metabolize given liver and renal failure.
   .
   # Cirrhosis
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol.
   - F/u hepatology recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who has undergone anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. She has been experiencing complications such as right-sided pleural effusion, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 45/26 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is somnolent and has decreased breath sounds over the right lung field.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hemothorax: The patient required 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday due to persistent right-sided pleural effusion. Her platelets and INR are stable, but there is a possibility of reaccumulation on chest X-ray. The plan is to monitor CT output, transfuse 1 unit of PRBC and 1 platelet, check CBC every 6 hours, and recheck CXR this afternoon for reaccumulation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient self-extubated yesterday and is now experiencing increasing PCO2. Oxygenation is stable on 2L nc. The plan is to check ABG and wean supplemental O2 as tolerated, aiming for SaO2 >92%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a chief complaint of whole body pain, depression, and anxiety. She has a history of cirrhosis, which has led to complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. The patient underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemothorax: The patient has a worsening right-sided pleural effusion and strikethrough on dressings. Multiple transfusions overnight indicate ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of chest X-ray, CT output, coagulation parameters, and fibrinogen levels is necessary. The patient should be monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration.

2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient did well post self-extubation, it is important to continue monitoring her respiratory status closely. Any signs of respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation should be promptly addressed.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is currently receiving hydrocortisone IV BID for adrenal insufficiency. It is crucial to continue this treatment and consider transitioning to oral hydrocortisone when appropriate.

4. Acute Renal Failure/Oliguria: The patient is diagnosed with Hepatic Resistant Syndrome (H"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a chief complaint of whole body pain, depression, and anxiety. She has a history of ethanol cirrhosis and is currently in the ICU for several complications, including anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion, persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient has been receiving multiple blood transfusions overnight due to hemothorax and strikethrough on dressings. She has also been receiving other medications such as Amicar, pantoprazole, midazolam, fentanyl, and various blood products.

The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains oliguric with a urine output of 55 mL since 12 AM. Her laboratory results show abnormalities including low hemoglobin, high white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and altered liver function tests.

The patient's plan includes monitoring her chest X-ray, CT output, coagulation profile, and fibrinogen levels. She will continue to receive Amicar and transfusions to maintain a hematocrit level above 30%. The feasibility of surgical intervention for the hemothorax will be discussed with thoracic surgery. The patient's respiratory status will continue to be monitored following self-extubation.

Other ongoing plans include continuing hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency, hemodial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion due to a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by several issues, including persistent right-sided pleural effusion, worsening oliguric renal failure, and respiratory failure. She has received blood transfusions and other blood products, and is currently on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemothorax: The patient has had a significant amount of bleeding requiring blood transfusions. Close monitoring of chest tube output is necessary to prevent further complications such as infection or re-accumulation of blood in the pleural space.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced respiratory failure post self-extubation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is essential to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hydrocortisone dose was decreased yesterday, and she will be converted to oral prednisone tomorrow with a slow taper. It is crucial to manage her corticosteroid replacement appropriately to prevent adrenal crisis.
4. Acute Renal Failure/Oliguria: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Continuing octreotide, midodrine, and sevelamer calcium carbonate therapy is necessary. Hemodialysis may be required to manage her renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, who underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient required blood transfusions yesterday due to hemothorax. She is currently on multiple medications including pain management, antibiotics, and treatment for cirrhosis-related complications such as encephalopathy and ascites.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemothorax: The patient experienced significant blood loss during surgery, leading to the need for blood transfusions. Close monitoring of the patient's clotting parameters and ongoing blood output is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently stable post self-extubation but requires ongoing respiratory support. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
3. Acute Renal Failure/Oliguria: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Continuing renal replacement therapy and following up with renal recommendations is important.
4. Cirrhosis-related complications: The patient has ascites, encephalopathy, and varices due to cirrhosis. These conditions require ongoing management with lactulose, rifaximin, and close hepatology follow-up.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis and complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. She underwent an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. The post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and respiratory failure. 

The patient required blood transfusions due to hemothorax and has received multiple blood products. Her CT output is being monitored, and serial hct, coags, fibrinogen levels are checked. Active T+S is planned, and ionized calcium levels need to be aggressively repleted.

The patient's respiratory failure is stable post self-extubation, and continued monitoring is recommended. The patient's hydrocortisone dose has been decreased to 12.5 mg per day due to adrenal insufficiency.

Acute renal failure/oliguria is secondary to hepatorenal syndrome type 1, and treatment includes octreotide, midodrine, and sevelamer calcium carbonate. Continuous hemodialysis (HD) is also indicated. Follow-up renal recommendations are pending.

Management for cirrhosis includes lactulose and rifaximin, while nadolol should be held. Hepatology recommendations are forthcoming. Neurosurgical follow-up is required if any issues arise with the T4 mass/lesion. Pain"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including cirrhosis, ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. She has undergone an anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion. Her post-operative course has been complicated by persistent right-sided pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis, worsening oliguric renal failure, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs show a stable temperature, slightly elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has significantly decreased from 79 kg at admission to 7.4 kg, which is concerning.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,650 mL and an output of 3,712 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,062 mL. The patient's urine output is very low at 42 mL. She is receiving IV fluids, including 1,540 mL of IVF, and her blood products transfusion requirement has been high, with 43 units of packed red blood cells, 21 units of platelets, 37 units of fresh frozen plasma, 3 units of cryoprecipitate, 2 units of Win-Rho, and 4 units of DDAVP.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL and a hematocrit of 28."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, complicated by ascites, encephalopathy, and varices. She underwent anterior-approach vertebrectomy and spinal fusion for a destructive T4 lesion and has since developed persistent right-sided pleural effusion, worsening oliguric renal failure, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 100/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 7.4 kg, with a total fluid input of 2,240 mL, including 522 mL of IV fluids. The patient's output consists of 900 mL of PO intake and 50 mL of TF output. The balance shows a net fluid gain of 1,295 mL.

The patient's blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.22, pCO2 of 45 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 19 mEq/L. The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.4 g/dL, leukocyte count is 6.3 K/uL, and platelet count is 50 K/uL. The creatinine level is 3.2 mg/dL, glucose level is 126 mg/dL, sodium level is 130 mEq/L, potassium level is 4.6 mEq/L, chloride level is 96 mEq/L, calcium level is 7.7 mg/dL, magnesium level is 2.2 mg/dL, and albumin level is 2.8 g/dL.

The patient has a history of hemothorax, with a CT output slowing down to 170 cc yesterday. She has received a total transfusion requirement of 43x pRBC, 21x Plt, 37x FFP, 3x cryo, 2x winrho, 4x ddavp, and 1x [Last Name (un)]. Her Hct is trending down to 26.6 from 29.3 yesterday post-transfusion but is now stable for 24 hours. The patient's PT/INR is 16.0/1.4, while her PT/PTT is 32.3. The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are within normal range, as well as her amylase/lipase levels.

The patient is being monitored for several conditions, including hemothorax, respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, acute renal failure/oliguria, cirrhosis, depression, and T4 mass/lesion. She is receiving medications such as lactulose, rifaximin, prednisone, sevelamer calcium carbonate"
