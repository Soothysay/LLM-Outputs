   #. Hypoxia: Differential for patient's hypoxia includes blossoming PNA
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis vs. flash pulmonary edema with dCHF and AF
   vs. PE.  The patient has been significantly diureesed during the course
   of the hospitalization, and on exam appears euvolemic to dry.  Patient
   was not acutly hypertensive during inciting event, and only became
   hypertensive in setting of prolonged hypoxia.  Chest XR without
   evidence of acute pulmonary edema.  Patient currently being treated for
   pneumonia and has been afebrile.  Chest CT shows dependent area of
   nodular opacities which could be consistent with infection vs.
   aspiration.  Patient has a history of severe aspiration on swallow
   study, and overall would feel that this would be most likely
   explanation of patinet's hypoxia and current equally rapid
   improvement.  PE seems less likely given supratherapeutic INR
   throughout hospitalization.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and polymyositis. She presents with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, and was transferred to the CCU with acutely worsened hypoxia. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's hypoxia could be due to pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, flash pulmonary edema with diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation (AF), or pulmonary embolism (PE). The chest X-ray does not show evidence of acute pulmonary edema, and the patient has been afebrile. A chest CT shows nodular opacities consistent with infection or aspiration. The patient has a history of severe aspiration on swallow study. Considering these factors, the most likely explanation for the patient's hypoxia is aspiration. 

Other medical complications that can arise include diastolic congestive heart failure (DCHF), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, acute renal failure (ARF), polymyositis, hypercholesterolemia, and feeding difficulties. 

The patient's current plan includes supportive O2 therapy, holding further diuresis, regular albuterol/atrovent nebs, continuing antibiotics, follow-up blood and sputum cultures, considering a right heart cath to evaluate filling pressures, repeating TTE in the morning, holding diuretics, continuing beta-blocker"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, and polymyositis. She presented to the ICU from a rehabilitation center with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. Her condition has worsened, with continued hypoxia despite high-flow oxygen therapy. She has a history of aspiration and her chest CT is consistent with pneumonitis, not congestive heart failure. The patient also has acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. She is currently euvolemic, but has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels. The patient's medications include verapamil, metoprolol, prednisone, simvastatin, Vanc/Levo, and albuterol/atrovent nebs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to experience hypoxia despite being on high-flow oxygen therapy. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. Monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation levels and providing supportive care will be important.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.2 to 1.9, indicating acute renal failure. It is crucial to monitor her urine output and electrolyte levels. Adjusting diuretic dosage and holding certain medications may be necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who presents from
   [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, transferred to CCU
   with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration pneumonitis.
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.  The patient has been informed she needs a PEG tube
   because of her high risk for aspiration when eating, however she
   refuses this intervention and continues to eat.
   - Aspiration precautions.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now given ARF and recent diuresis.
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - As a component of her hypoxia may be bronchospasm given her history
   of asthma and her use of a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] treat with solumedrol 80
   mg IV q8h to see if this improves her hypoxia at all.
   .
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints of chest pain and no
   ischemic changes on EKG.
   .
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.  TTE yesterday
   showed EF of 55-60% with grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic
   stenosis, and mild pulm art htn.
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  As the patient has been bradycardic,
   will dc verapamil and start diltiazem 30 mg tid to improve diastolic
   filling.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, INR of 2.8 today, will restart her
   coumadin at a lower dose given levofloxacin.
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and change to diltiazem at above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   2.3 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased during
   this admission to 60mg PO qday.
   - Solumedrol as above.
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - cont simvastatin 10mg daily
   .  .
   #. FEN:
         Thin liquids and pureed solids
      A. PO intake reclined in chair/bed ~45-60 degrees as able.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and polymyositis. She presents with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been placed on various medical treatments and interventions.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential risk for further respiratory distress or failure. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and it is important to closely monitor her respiratory status and continue with supportive oxygen therapy.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. Further evaluation and management are required to prevent further deterioration of renal function and to address any underlying causes.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a new diagnosis of AF, which may contribute to acute diastolic heart failure. Monitoring her cardiac rhythm and adjusting medications accordingly is essential to maintain adequate heart function.

4. Coronary artery disease: Although the patient has no history of coronary artery disease, her presentation with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and lower extremity edema raises concerns for possible cardiac involvement. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent any complications related to the heart.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and polymyositis. She was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation hospital with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to the transfer to the CCU due to acutely worsened hypoxia likely caused by aspiration pneumonitis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 135/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 6L of nasal cannula oxygen. Her physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, trace lower extremity pre-tibial edema, and supple neck with jugular venous distention of 8 cm.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.3 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 537 thousand/mm³, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 32 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, and glucose of 90 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated lactic acid levels and slightly low calcium levels.

The patient's current assessment includes hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who presents from
   [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, transferred to CCU
   with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration pneumonitis.
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.  The patient has been informed she needs a PEG tube
   because of her high risk for aspiration when eating, however she
   refuses this intervention and continues to eat.
   - Aspiration precautions.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now given ARF and recent diuresis.
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - As a component of her hypoxia may be bronchospasm given her history
   of asthma and her use of a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] treat with solumedrol 80
   mg IV q8h to see if this improves her hypoxia at all
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints of chest pain and no
   ischemic changes on EKG.
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.  TTE yesterday
   showed EF of 55-60% with grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic
   stenosis, and mild pulm art htn.
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  As the patient has been bradycardic,
   will dc verapamil and start diltiazem 30 mg tid to improve diastolic
   filling.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, INR of 2.8 today, will restart her
   coumadin at a lower dose given levofloxacin.
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and change to diltiazem at above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   2.3 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased during
   this admission to 60mg PO qday.
   - Solumedrol as above
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - cont simvastatin 10mg daily
   #. FEN:
         Thin liquids and pureed solids
      A. PO intake reclined in chair/bed ~45-60 degrees as able.
      B. Effortful swallow with small bites of food x 2.
      C. [**1-20**] follow-up sips of thin liquid to clear pharyngeal residue.
      D. Alternate bites and sips.
      E. Cough after follow-up swallows to clear any penetration.
      F. NO Talking until follow-up swallows/sips have been used  after
   each bite.
   #. Access: PIV
   #. PPx:
   - DVT: systemic anticoagulation
   - Bowel: Senna and Colace
   #. Code: Full per patient and HCP
   #. Dispo: CCU for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and polymyositis. She presented from another hospital with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:
  1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels are likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. She has been informed about the need for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube to reduce the risk of aspiration, but she refuses this intervention and continues to eat normally. Aspiration precautions are in place, and the patient is receiving supportive oxygen therapy.
  2. Coronaries: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease, and her recent stress test did not reveal any cardiac defects. She is not experiencing chest pain, and there are no ischemic changes on her EKG.
  3. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with diastolic heart failure, including elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, hypoxia, and lower extremity edema. Her ejection fraction (EF) is within normal range, but there is evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Diuretic therapy has been held due"
