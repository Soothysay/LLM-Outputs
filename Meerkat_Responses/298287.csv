","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent stenting in the left anterior descending artery. He also has prostate cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anxiety. The patient presented with chest pressure and dyspnea after playing basketball.

The patient was admitted to the ICU due to cardiogenic shock secondary to a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). He was started on an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) and required varying degrees of dopamine initially, which were later weaned off. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 30% with moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. There is also evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray.

The patient's current medications include heparin, aspirin, Plavix, a high-dose statin, and beta-blockers. He is also receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's cardiogenic shock, further deterioration of the left ventricular function, development of new arrhythmias, progression of pulmonary edema, and potential bleeding complications due to the anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status, cardiac function, and respiratory status will be necessary. Additionally, careful management of the anticoagulation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with chest pressure and dyspnea after playing basketball. He underwent revascularization at a different hospital and was started on aspirin, Plavix, Reopro, and heparin. Initially, the patient required dopamine but was weaned off it on December 10th. The course of Reopro is now complete, and the patient remains on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). His lipid panel revealed elevated cholesterol levels but normal HDL and LDL levels. Troponin levels are still markedly elevated.

The patient's condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock. He arrived on IABP and dopamine, but no longer requires dopamine. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction of 30% with moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient received two doses of intravenous Lasix and is currently doing well without any subjective dyspnea. He was trialed on IABP 1:2 but returned to 1:1 due to a drop in cardiac index (CI). The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's CI, and if it remains above 2.0, the IABP may be discontinued later today. Repeat chest X-ray and follow-up are also planned.

The patient has a history of prostate cancer for which he is taking Avodart and Cas"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent a stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. He also has prostate cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anxiety. The patient presented with chest pressure and dyspnea after playing basketball and was found to have a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). He arrived at the hospital in cardiogenic shock and was placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and dopamine. The patient's ejection fraction is 30% with moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. He received two doses of IV Lasix to reduce fluid overload and was well on room air without subjective dyspnea. The patient was initially on IABP 1:1, but was later switched to 1:2 and then back to 1:1 due to changes in cardiac index (CI). His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 58%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes with a troponin level of 8.39, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. His lipid panel revealed high cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL levels, while his HDL level is within normal range. The patient's medications include ASA (acetylsalicylic acid), Plavix, Atorvastatin, Heparin, and Pantoprazole.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with chest pressure and dyspnea after playing basketball. He has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, reteplase, and heparin. The patient initially required dopamine but was weaned off it. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and heparin.

The patient's initial assessment showed elevated cardiac enzymes and a markedly elevated troponin level of 8.39. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and akinesis in the mid to distal septal, anterior, and apical regions.

The patient was placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support due to cardiogenic shock. He was also given two doses of intravenous (IV) Lasix to manage fluid overload. The patient was initially on IABP 1:1 but was later switched to IABP 1:2 and then back to 1:1. The patient's cardiac index (CI) has been fluctuating, and there have been concerns about discontinuing the IABP.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and prostate cancer (Ca). He presented with chest pressure and dyspnea after playing basketball. He has been off his antiplatelet medication (Plavix) for five days. Upon admission, he was initially required to receive dopamine but was weaned off it on December 10th. The patient underwent revascularization at Hospital3 on December 10th and was started on aspirin (ASA), Plavix, reopro, and heparin. His lipid panel revealed cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 150, LDL of 116, and HDL of 55. The patient's troponin levels are still markedly elevated at 8.39 on December 11th. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Coronaries: The patient was revascularized at Hospital3 and started on ASA, Plavix, Reopro, and heparin. Initially, he required dopamine but was weaned off it on December 10th. The course of Reopro is now complete, and the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) remains in place. The patient's lipid panel revealed cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 150, LDL of 116, and HDL of 55. The patient's troponin levels are still markedly elevated at 8.39 on December 11th. 
   - ASA 325mg PO daily
   - Plavix 75mg PO daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg PO daily
   - Heparin gtt until IABP discontinued
   - Begin Beta-blocker when IABP pulled

2. Pump: The patient experienced a STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock. The patient arrived on IABP and dopamine; the patient no longer requires dopamine. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mid to distal septal, anterior, and apical akinesis (the apex is nearly dyskinetic). Chest X-ray (CXR) on December 10th showed mild fluid overload with some fluid in the minor fissure. He received two doses of intravenous (IV) Lasix and now sits well on room air without subjective dyspnea. The patient was trialed on IABP 1:2 with a drop in his cardiac index (CI), so returned to 1:1. Again, turned down to 1:2 this morning.
   - If CI remains >2.0, can discontinue IABP later today.
   - F/U repeat CXR
   - Lasix PRN: dyspnea

- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent stent placement in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
- The patient presented with chest pressure and dyspnea after playing basketball, which may indicate a myocardial infarction (heart attack).
- The patient was initially on ASA, Plavix, Reopro, and heparin, and required dopamine for cardiogenic shock but was later weaned off.
- The patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) inserted but it was successfully removed on [**12-12**].
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
- The patient received two doses of IV Lasix to manage fluid overload.
- The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and will begin low-dose beta-blockers as tolerated.
- The patient has a history of prostate cancer and is currently on Avodart but holding Lupron and Casodex.
- The patient also has a history of anxiety and GERD, for which he will be started on lorazepam and pantoprazole, respectively.
- The patient's labs show elevated troponin-T levels, elevated LDH, and other abnormalities consistent with myocardial injury.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with chest pressure and dyspnea after playing basketball. He was found to have a STEMI and cardiogenic shock, requiring an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and dopamine. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 30% with moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. His troponin-T levels are elevated at 21.30, indicating ongoing myocardial injury.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 82/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is currently on supplemental oxygen but not on mechanical ventilation.

His physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearing man lying on his back in bed. His jugular venous pulse (JVP) is flat, and his peripheral pulses are present and well-perfused. The patient has a small hematoma at the right groin from the IABP site, but no femoral bruits are noted. Neurologically, he is attentive, conversant, and able to move all extremities.
