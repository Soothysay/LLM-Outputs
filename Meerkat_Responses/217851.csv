","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of dementia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and a recent left femoral fracture. The patient was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed mechanical fall at a rehabilitation facility. The patient has been unable to provide any history due to language barriers.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/82 to 151/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema of 1+. The patient's abdomen is described as soft with bowel sounds present and distended. The patient's left leg is in traction with a pin through the knee. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 29.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.9%, platelet count of 173 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 179 mg/dL, and sodium level of 20 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

1. Left femur fracture: The patient has a comminuted left intertrochanteric femoral fracture. This could lead to complications such as non-union or malunion of the fracture, infection, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility.

2. Anemia: The patient has a high normocytic anemia, which may be related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension, which resolved prior to admission to the ICU. Possible causes include medication effects (such as morphine), bleeding, undiagnosed infection, or cardiac event. Monitoring and further investigation are necessary to identify the cause and prevent future episodes.

4. Abdominal distension: The patient has abdominal distension, which could be due to bowel obstruction, volvulus, or fecal impaction. Imaging studies and serial abdominal exams are needed to evaluate the cause and guide management.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be a stress reaction or indicative of an undiagnosed infectious source. Monitoring of complete blood counts (CBC) and cultures if spikes fever are important to assess for infection.
