   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is pneumonia and hypoxemia. The patient is a 90-year-old woman who was recently discharged from the hospital for left lower lobe pneumonia and is now presenting with respiratory distress and hypoxia. She has copious secretions and persistent opacity on the chest X-ray. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemia, which indicates inadequate oxygenation of the blood. This can progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's sudden onset of symptoms and poor dentition, there is a possibility of aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration occurs when foreign material enters the airways, leading to infection.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of VRE UTI and the recent urine culture was negative. There is a possibility of a recurrent UTI, especially considering the broad-spectrum antibiotics being administered.
5. Dehydration: The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving IV fluids, which may increase the risk of dehydration if not properly managed.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and magnesium, are within normal ranges but should be monitored closely due to the ongoing IV fluids and medications.
7. Stress ulcers: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease, and stress ulcers can occur in critically ill patients. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are being administered to prevent this.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, maintain adequate oxygenation, manage secretions, and prevent further complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with symptoms of pneumonia, respiratory distress, and hypoxia. She has a history of recent admission for lower left lobe pneumonia and is a nursing home resident. The patient has shown improvement overnight after fluids and suctioning. The plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, repeat sputum culture, chest X-ray, aspiration precautions if swallow study is positive, weaning off oxygen, and administering ipratroprium nebs. Other concerns include a urinary tract infection with over 100K yeast, low urine output, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and possible history of peptic ulcer disease. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she requires ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Healthcare-acquired pneumonia: The patient's age, nursing home residency, and recent admission for pneumonia increase the risk of healthcare-acquired pneumonia.
2. Aspiration event: Given the patient's sudden onset of respiratory distress and persistent opacity on chest X-ray, aspiration of secretions could be a possible complication.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of over 100K yeast in the urine indicates a UTI, which may require treatment.
4. Low urine output: Despite boluses and aggressive IV fluid management, the patient's urine output remains low, which could indicate renal dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular"

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of recent admission for left lower lobe pneumonia, who presents with hypoxia and respiratory distress. She has persistent opacity on CXR and UTI. She is a nursing home resident and was discharged on Levo/Flagyl. The patient showed improvement overnight after fluids and suction. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is likely healthcare acquired due to her nursing home residency and recent admission for LLL pneumonia. It is important to provide broad-spectrum antibiotics, repeat sputum culture, chest X-ray, and aspiration precautions if the swallow study is positive.

2. UTI: The patient has a yeast infection with >100K yeast. It is necessary to pull the Foley catheter and provide appropriate treatment for the UTI.

3. Low UOP: The patient has poor urinary output despite receiving boluses. It may be due to leakage around the Foley catheter. Conservative IVF should be continued given the pulmonary status and DNR status.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with RVR, which could be related to early sepsis or dehydration. The patient converted to sinus rhythm last PM, and Lopressor should be restarted at 12.5 mg.

5. History of PUD: The patient has a history of pe"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for lower left lobe pneumonia. She presents with hypoxia and respiratory distress, persistent opacity on chest X-ray, and a urinary tract infection. The patient is a nursing home resident and has been recently discharged for LLL pneumonia. She is stable overnight but with copious secretions. The plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn), sputum culture, chest X-ray, aspiration precautions, nonrebreather mask, and consideration for nebulizer treatments. A repeat urine culture is also planned, along with treating UTI broadly with Vanco/Zosyn. The patient's tachycardia appears to be sinus rhythm on repeat EKG. She has a history of VRE UTI in the past. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's recent admission for LLL pneumonia and the current symptoms suggest a possible healthcare-acquired pneumonia. This may require broader coverage given the relapse.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Maintaining adequate oxygenation is crucial.
3. Aspiration: The patient's poor swallowing evaluation and presence of mucous plugging raise concerns for aspiration events. Aspiration precautions, including strict NPO and use of a nasogastric tube, are necessary to prevent further aspiration"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIC ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Secondary to BLL nosocomial
   pneumonia.  Mobilizing large amount of secretions once hydrated.
   Continues on vanco/zosyn/levoquin.   Continue nebs.  Vanco dose
   adjusted based on weight.  WBC slightly down.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP):  As above.

 UTI:  Growing greater than 100K yeast.  Not clear if foley is
   chronic from the NH. Will discontinue foley.  Repeat UA, C+S.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RVR:  Now converted back to sinus rhythm
   which she continues in this morning.  Likely triggered by acute
   respiratory decompensation.  Will continue to monitor.
 HYPERTENSION:  Benign HTN, restarting beta blocker.
 HYPOKALEMIA:  Replete and followup electrolytes this afternoon.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by yeast, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), hypertension, and hypokalemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/68 mmHg to 90/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, metoprolol, diltiazem, heparin sodium, and regular insulin sliding scale. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, diminished peripheral pulses, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no skin assessment. The patient's neurologic examination is incomplete. 

The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition via nasogastric tube, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prevention with proton pump inhibitor, and ventilation protection measures.
