   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and depression. He was admitted to the ICU for further management. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits, but he had an abnormal EKG showing possible cardiac abnormalities. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values were not provided, but his oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 96% on a nasal cannula.

The patient underwent dialysis catheter insertion on 08/25/2136 at 05:38 PM due to yellow pus draining from the site, and it was stopped at 09:15 PM with a sterile dressing applied. Another attempt was made to insert the dialysis catheter on 08/26/2136 at an unspecified time, but details about its success or failure were not mentioned.

The patient's review of systems remained unchanged from admission except for the presence of a sterile dressing over the dialysis catheter site. The patient's flow sheet data showed stable vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's fluid balance indicated an intake of 706 mL and output of 800 mL since midnight, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 94 mL.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.3 K/uL and 6.9 K/uL"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) on Coumadin. She presents from dialysis with pus coming from the HD site and hyperkalemia.

The patient has a central line infection, which has grown out Proteus and Staphylococcus. Surgery is aware of this and plans to remove the HD line tonight. Blood cultures and wound cultures will be followed up, and vancomycin will be continued with HD. Ceftriaxone will not be given due to a previous allergic reaction in the emergency department.

The patient also has hyperkalemia, likely secondary to renal failure. She has received treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate twice. Kayexalate will be continued for now, and hemodialysis will be held until the potassium levels are under control. The patient will be monitored every four hours, and if there are any worsening EKG changes, renal for HD will be called.

The patient has a history of ESRD and requires routine HD three times a week. However, due to the presumed line infection, she did not complete HD today. The HD line will be removed today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on Coumadin. She presents to the ICU with pus coming from her HD site and hyperkalemia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Line Infection: The patient has an infection in her central or arterial line, which is demonstrated by pus coming from the HD site. The line has grown out Proteus and Staph aureus, indicating a bacterial infection. Surgery is aware of this and plans to remove the HD line tonight. Blood and wound cultures will be followed up, and vancomycin will be continued during HD.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, likely due to renal failure. She has been treated with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate twice. Kayexalate will be continued for now, and medical treatment will be pursued. HD will be held for now, and potassium will be monitored every four hours. If there are worsening EKG changes or inability to get potassium levels down, renal for HD will be called.

3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and requires routine HD. However, due to the line"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) on Coumadin. She presents from dialysis with pus coming from the HD site and hyperkalemia. 

The patient has had multiple line infections, including a central line that was removed due to infection and grew out Proteus and Staphylococcus aureus. She also has elevated potassium levels, which are likely due to renal failure, and is currently being treated with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. 

The patient has ESRD and receives HD three times a week. However, she did not complete HD today due to a presumed line infection, and her HD line is being removed today. Her renal team is aware of the situation and will give her a line holiday. A new line will be placed on Monday. 

The patient has type II DM and her sugars have been low upon arrival to the ICU. Her Lantus will be held for now, but she will continue with her regular insulin sliding scale and ISS per home regimen when her sugars normalize. 

The patient also has depression and will continue taking her home paxil. 

ICU care includes renal diabetic diet, regular insulin"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with history of ESRD now admit with catheter related
   infection and hyperkalemia from dialysis.  She does not have evidence
   of blood cultures showing growth of organisms and does not have
   significant hypotension, fever or tachycardia.
 LINE INFECTION (CENTRAL OR ARTERIAL)
   -Will continue to try maintain patient without HD line for additional
   24 hours but hyperkalemia remains significant
   -No evidence of evolution to sepsis at this time
   -Will continue with Vancomycin IV as primary antibiotic
   -Add Tobra for GNR
s given wound culture results and desire to minimize
   any risk for recurrent infection.
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)-
   -Will need continued managment with Kayexalate as primary modality
   while awaiting dialysis
   -Follow q 4-8 hours depending on stability over the course of the day.
   -Minimize K intake
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   -Renal consult service following patient and current plan is to resume
   dialysis [**2136-8-27**] if patient able to tolerate additional 24 hours given
   concern for infection and repeated infection
   -Agree with Renal consultation to work towards dialysis tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU for a catheter-related infection and hyperkalemia from dialysis. She has no evidence of sepsis and does not have fever, hypotension, or tachycardia. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 63/45 to 71/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. She is overweight/obese, has symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and no rash. Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels (6.9 K/uL), low hemoglobin (13.5 g/dL), slightly elevated white blood cell count (6.3-6.9 K/uL), and increased creatinine (7.2 mg/dL).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Catheter-related infection: The patient has a catheter-related infection, which can lead to local site infections or systemic infections such as sepsis if not managed properly.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can result in cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory difficulties if not managed promptly.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD puts her at risk for further renal complications, such as fluid overload"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) on coumadin. The patient presents from dialysis with pus coming from the HD site and hyperkalemia.

Medical Complications:

1. Line Infection (Central or Arterial)-HD line:
   - The patient has an infected HD line, which was previously removed on 8/25 and was difficult to remove due to granulation.
   - The line tip culture is pending, and the patient is receiving ceftazidime and vancomycin.
   - Blood cultures are also positive for Proteus and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
   - The IR will replace the line today so that the patient can receive HD.

2. Hyperkalemia (High Potassium, Hyperpotassemia):
   - The patient has elevated potassium levels, likely due to renal failure.
   - Treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate has been administered.
   - The patient is being monitored closely for any changes in potassium levels and EKG changes.
   - If the patient's potassium levels do not decrease or if there are worsening"

2. Hyperkalemia (high potassium): The patient has elevated potassium levels, likely due to renal failure. The patient has been treated with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Monitoring of potassium levels every 4 hours and EKG changes is necessary.

3. Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD): The patient routinely receives HD three times a week. However, she did not complete HD today due to presumed line infection. A new line will be placed today, and the patient will continue with her home regimen of sevelamer and cinacalcet.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) on coumadin. She presents from dialysis with pus coming from the hemodialysis (HD) site and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line Infection (Central or Arterial)-HD line:
   - The patient's HD line has been infected, as indicated by pus coming from the site.
   - The infection was caused by Proteus and Staph, which were sparse growth and difficult to remove.
   - The patient is currently on vancomycin and tobramycin, which may be renal toxic but necessary due to the ongoing infection.
   - Blood cultures, wound cultures, and line tip culture will be followed up.
   - The infected line will be replaced by an interventional radiologist tomorrow so that the patient can receive HD.

2. Hyperkalemia (High Potassium, Hyperpotassemia):
   - The patient has elevated potassium levels, likely due to renal failure.
   - She has received treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate twice.
   - Medical management will continue to treat hyperkalemia.
   - HD will be held for now per"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) on Coumadin. The patient presented from dialysis with pus coming from the HD site and hyperkalemia. She has been diagnosed with line infection, hyperkalemia, renal failure, depression, hypotension, chest pain, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line Infection (Central or Arterial) - HD line: The patient has an infection in her hemodialysis line, which has grown out Proteus and Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). She will receive a new line and be treated with ceftazidime and vancomycin. Gentamicin may also be considered after discussing with the infectious disease specialist.

2. Hyperkalemia (High Potassium): The patient has elevated potassium levels due to renal failure. She has been treated with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required, especially during hemodialysis.

3. Renal Failure, End Stage: The patient has ESRD and requires regular hemodialysis. The recent line infection has caused a delay in her dialysis treatment. A"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of not feeling right, shaking, and blurry vision. The patient has been diagnosed with renal failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hypercalcemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 46/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently receiving dialysis and has a temporary femoral line placed. The patient's labs show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and calcium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's compromised immune system due to ESRD and the presence of an arterial line and dialysis catheter, there is a risk of developing infections such as line infections or sepsis.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient's symptoms of shaking and blurry vision, along with changes in vital signs, may indicate potential cardiac complications. Further evaluation of the patient's cardiac status is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure of 46/31 mmHg indicates hypotension. This could be due to fluid overload or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has elevated levels of potassium and calcium, which can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Respiratory complications:"

   Diastolic CHF, IDDM and bilateral DVTs on coumadin who presents from
   dialysis with pus coming from HD site and hyperkalemia
 LINE INFECTION (CENTRAL OR ARTERIAL)-HD line
   - Pt remains afebrile without leukocytosis but line clearly
   demonstrates infection and grew out proteus (sparse growth) and staph
   [**8-24**]-line d/ced by surgery [**8-25**].  It was granulated and difficult for
   removal. To receive new line [**2136-8-27**]
   -f/u line tip culture
    - receiving ceftazidine and vancomycin (d 2 today of ceftaz and d 3 of
   vanc). Since Pt had allergy to ceftriaxone in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] discuss
   gentamicin with ID and D/C ceftazidine once GNR coverage is determined
   -f/u blood cultures, wound culture positive x 1 for Proteus and MSSA
   -renal following
   -IR to replace line today so pt can receive HD
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)-Pt with elevated K
   likely [**2-18**] renal failure; currently s/p treatment with Ca gluconate,
   Insulin, dextrose and kayexalate x6, albuterol nebs
   -Continue to treat medically. At this time K is WNL. HD should obviate
   need for further aggressive management.
   -Monitor K q4 hours
   -Monitor on tele
   -also send for hemolysis labs to help explain the rise in K after it is
   brought down (consider today, but unlikely given WNL LDH)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD) -Pt
   routinely gets HD T,[**Doctor First Name **],Sat but did not complete HD today [**2-18**] presumed
   line infection.  HD line to be removed today per surgery.  Renal aware
   of pt and will give line holiday
   -Plan for new line today
   -Continue sevelamer and cinalcalcet per home regimen
   - Avoid Pi loads given hyperphosphatemia
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II-Sugars have been low on arrival to
   ICU; will hold Lantus for now but when sugars normalize will contineu
   lantus and ISS per home regimen
  Chest pain: Seems non-cardiogenic. Occurred today after discussing
   tunneled line, which Pt opposed initially. Reproducible with pressure
   on location. Described as pressure and pain. No radiation. No ECG
   changes or SOB.
   -          F/U with serial cardiac enzymes
   -          Consider uremia as possible cause given last HD was 5 days
   ago and Pt has asterixis
   -          Pt on tele
 DEPRESSION-Continue home paxil
Hypotension: BP 74/32 at 4am ON, responded to fluid bolus x3
 Hx DVT admitted on Coumadin. Holding until line placed (m/l)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) on Coumadin. The patient presented from dialysis with pus coming from the HD site and hyperkalemia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. LINE INFECTION (CENTRAL OR ARTERIAL)-HD line: The patient has an infected HD line that was previously removed on 8/25 due to granulation and difficulty in removal. A new line was placed on 8/27. The line tip culture grew Proteus and MSSA. The patient is receiving ceftazidime and vancomycin.
2. HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA): The patient has elevated potassium levels likely due to renal failure. Treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate has been initiated.
3. RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (ESRD): The patient routinely gets HD three times a week but did not complete HD today due to presumed line infection. A new line will be placed today.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: The patient's blood sugars have been low"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:62 yo female with h/o ESRD on HD, multiple line infections,
   Diastolic CHF, IDDM and bilateral DVTs on coumadin who presents from
   dialysis with pus coming from HD site and hyperkalemia. At this time
   improving on HD and medical management.
 LINE INFECTION (CENTRAL OR ARTERIAL)-HD line pulled and covered with
   appropriate Abx. Leukocytosis improving.
   - Pt remains afebrile without leukocytosis but line clearly
   demonstrated infection and grew out proteus MSSA. Line d/ced by surgery
   [**8-25**].  It was granulated and difficult for removal.
   - wound culture positive for Proteus and MSSA, line tip culture sterile
   as of [**2136-8-28**], blood cultures no growth so far
    - receiving ceftazidine and vancomycin (d 3 today of ceftaz and d 4 of
   vanc). Pt had allergy to ceftriaxone in the ED but tolerating
   ceftazidine well. Plan to continue Abx for 14 days total
   -renal following
   -IR placed femoral catheter on [**2136-8-27**]
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)-Pt with elevated K
   likely [**2-18**] renal failure; currently s/p treatment with Ca gluconate,
   Insulin, dextrose and kayexalate x6, albuterol nebs
   - At this time K is WNL. HD should obviate need for further aggressive
   management.
   - no need to monitor K more than qDay at this time
   - Etiology for hyperK still unclear. Hemolysis labs WNL
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD) -Pt
   routinely gets HD T,[**Doctor First Name **],Sat but missed HD for 4 days after line was
   pulled for infection.
   -Temporary femoral line placed [**2136-8-27**]. Permanent line not placed [**2-18**]
   bilat internal jugular vein thromboses
   -Continue sevelamer and cinalcalcet
   - Avoid Pi loads given hyperphosphatemia
   - Access is a major long term problem for this patient
   - Start mitodrine for HoTN with dialysis
 SLEEP APNEA: Pt desats with apneas at night. pCO2 was 80 ON with pH
   7.19 and O2 104 on 3L. Improved to pCO2 63 pH 7.26 O2 80 on 1L with
   waking
   - Encourage CPAP with sleep
   - Pt to be on1L O2 ON
   - D/c O/N blood gasses
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II-Sugars have been low on arrival to
   ICU; will hold Lantus for now but when sugars normalize will contineu
   lantus and ISS per home regimen
  CHEST PAIN: Seems non-cardiogenic. Occurred today after discussing
   tunneled line, which Pt opposed initially. Reproducible with pressure
   on location. Described as pressure and pain. No radiation. No ECG
   changes or SOB.
   - F/U with serial cardiac enzymes. Trp trended up to 0.03, but unclear
   if this is [**2-18**] low GFR or true leak.
   - ECGs without any ST-T changes
   -  Consider uremia as possible cause given last HD was 5 days ago and
   Pt has asterixis
   - Pt on tele
   - ECHO today or tomorrow
 MACROCYTOSIS: Pt with MCV 102, persistently in the 100s this
   admission with NL folate and B12 within a month.
   - Etiology could be uremia, hypothyroidism, or reticulocytosis
   - Chest TSH today
 DEPRESSION-Continue home paxil

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) on coumadin. The patient presented from dialysis with pus coming from the HD site and hyperkalemia. She is currently improving on HD and medical management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line Infection (Central or Arterial): The patient had a line infection that was treated by pulling the line and starting appropriate antibiotics. The wound culture was positive for Proteus and MSSA, while the line tip culture was sterile. Blood cultures showed no growth so far. The patient is receiving ceftazidime and vancomycin, and the plan is to continue antibiotic therapy for 14 days.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient had elevated potassium levels, which were managed with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. The potassium level is now within normal range. The etiology of hyperkalemia is still unclear, and hemolysis labs were normal.
3. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient has chronic kidney disease requiring regular hemodialysis. She missed HD for four days after her line was pulled for infection. A temporary femoral line has been placed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diabetic heart failure (Diastolic CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs) on coumadin. She presented from dialysis with pus coming from the HD site and hyperkalemia. The patient has been diagnosed with line infection, hyperkalemia, renal failure, and sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has been experiencing recurrent line infections, including a central line infection that grew Proteus and MSSA. She is currently receiving ceftazidime and vancomycin, but blood cultures have shown no growth so far. It is important to monitor the patient for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with high potassium levels, which could be due to renal failure. She received treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Her potassium levels are now within normal range, but close monitoring is still necessary.

3. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and requires regular HD. Her renal function needs to be closely monitored, and she may require further interventions to manage her kidney disease.

4. Sleep apnea: The patient experiences desaturation events at night, likely due"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:62 yo female with h/o ESRD on HD, multiple line infections,
   Diastolic CHF, IDDM and bilateral DVTs on coumadin who presents from
   dialysis with pus coming from HD site and hyperkalemia
 LINE INFECTION (CENTRAL OR ARTERIAL)-HD line
   - Pt remains afebrile without leukocytosis but line clearly
   demonstrates infection and grew out proteus (sparse growth) and staph
   [**8-24**]-line d/ced by surgery [**8-25**].  It was granulated and difficult for
   removal. To receive new line [**2136-8-27**]
   - wound culture positive for Proteus and MSSA, line tip culture sterile
   as of [**2136-8-28**], blood cultures no growth so far
    - receiving ceftazidine and vancomycin (d 3 today of ceftaz and d 4 of
   vanc). Pt had allergy to ceftriaxone in the ED but tolerating
   ceftazidine well.
   -renal following
   -IR placed femoral catheter on [**2136-8-27**]
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)-Pt with elevated K
   likely [**2-18**] renal failure; currently s/p treatment with Ca gluconate,
   Insulin, dextrose and kayexalate x6, albuterol nebs
   - At this time K is WNL. HD should obviate need for further aggressive
   management.
   - no need to monitor K more than qDay at this time
   -Monitor on tele
   - Etiology for hyperK still unclear. Hemolysis labs WNL
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD) -Pt
   routinely gets HD T,[**Doctor First Name **],Sat but did not complete HD today [**2-18**] presumed
   line infection.  HD line to be removed today per surgery.  Renal aware
   of pt and will give line holiday
   -Temporary femoral line placed [**2136-8-27**]. Permanent line not placed [**2-18**]
   bilat internal jugular vein thromboses
   -Continue sevelamer and cinalcalcet
   - Avoid Pi loads given hyperphosphatemia
 SLEEP APNEA: Pt desats with apneas at night. pCO2 was 80 ON with pH
   7.19 and O2 104 on 3L. Improved to pCO2 63 pH 7.26 O2 80 on 1L with
   waking
   -          Encourage CPAP with sleep
   -          Consider long acting B-agonist HS (?)
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II-Sugars have been low on arrival to
   ICU; will hold Lantus for now but when sugars normalize will contineu
   lantus and ISS per home regimen
  CHEST PAIN: Seems non-cardiogenic. Occurred today after discussing
   tunneled line, which Pt opposed initially. Reproducible with pressure
   on location. Described as pressure and pain. No radiation. No ECG
   changes or SOB.
   -          F/U with serial cardiac enzymes. Trp trended up to 0.03, but
   unclear if this is [**2-18**] low GFR or true leak.
   -          ECGs without any ST-T changes
   -          Consider uremia as possible cause given last HD was 5 days
   ago and Pt has asterixis
   -          Pt on tele
 MACROCYTOSIS: Pt with MCV 102, persistently in the 100s this
   admission with NL folate and B12 within a month.
   -          Etiology could be uremia, hypothyroidism, or reticulocytosis
   -          Chest TSH today
 DEPRESSION-Continue home paxil
HYPOTENSION: Holding BPs well
 Hx DVT admitted on Coumadin. Awaiting call from IR for when to
   restart

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), multiple line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) on coumadin. She presented from dialysis with pus coming from the HD site and hyperkalemia. The patient has had multiple line infections, including a central line infection that was removed and a temporary femoral line placed. She also has hyperkalemia, renal failure, sleep apnea, type II diabetes mellitus, chest pain, macrocytosis, and depression. The patient is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics, insulin, and other medications as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line Infection: The patient has had multiple line infections, including a central line infection that was removed. There is still a risk of infection at the temporary femoral line placed.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with hyperkalemia, which is an elevated level of potassium in the blood. This can be life-threatening and requires careful management.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration of renal function.
4. Sleep Apnea: The patient has sleep apnea, which can lead to respiratory complications and disturbances in oxygenation.
