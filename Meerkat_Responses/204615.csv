   24 Hour Events:
   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 51 yo man no known medical history was
   noticed to be driving erratically earlier this morning in NH and
   ultimately suffered an unrestrained MVA crashing his car into a tree.
   Did not appear to EMS to be traumatic arrest. Found apneic and
   pulseless in VF, with downtime of minutes before CPR initiated with
   EMS. Shocked 3x, epinephrine x2,atropine x1, lidocaine 2g IV then taken
   to [**Hospital3 **] Center in NH, then to [**University/College 2158**]. On arrival to the
   [**Hospital1 5**] ED he had a GCS of 7, unconscious. Initial CE were CK: 1694
   Trop-T: 4.11 and have EKG changes consistent with STEMI. He was loaded
   with [**Last Name (LF) 12105**],[**First Name3 (LF) **], integrillin, and started on heparin drip.  Within 3
   hours of his arrest he hit the cath lab and was found to have total
   occlusion of the LAD proximally with BMS placed to the ostium of the
   LAD. There was also 30% distal RCA lesion, minimal Lcx disease. He
   underwent LHC with L ventriculograpy and coronary angiography which
   noted proximal TO of LAD. A BMS was placed.
   On leaving the cath lab he was found to be hypertensive and was started
   on nitro gtt, and NGT was placed, and transferred to the CCU.
   On arrival to the CCU he was hemodynamically stable. A repeat EKG at
   that time showed improvement in his ST elevation post
   revascularization. He was weaned off nitro GTT, continued on [**First Name3 (LF) 12105**] and
   heparin GTT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male who presented with a STEMI and ventricular fibrillation arrest. He has a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis. The patient underwent reperfusion therapy with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). He was also started on heparin, atorvastatin, and aspirin.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient suffered a ventricular fibrillation arrest in the field and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). He was successfully defibrillated and intubated.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient had a STEMI, which resulted in a total occlusion of the LAD. He underwent reperfusion therapy with PCI and stenting.
3. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which required aggressive fluid resuscitation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient developed renal failure as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient developed metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. Further evaluation revealed hyperglycemia without a known history of diabetes mellitus.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.6 K/uL. This may be due to stress response or aspiration pneumonia.
7. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient had evidence of aspiration pneumonia on the chest X-ray, likely secondary to his unconscious state.
8. Hepatic Abnormality: A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 15mm hypodensity in the left hepatic lobe, suggesting a liver abnormality.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's prolonged intubation and potential aspiration pneumonia may increase the risk of developing ARDS.
2. Hepatic Failure: The hepatic abnormality seen on the CT scan may progress to hepatic failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and aspiration pneumonia may predispose him to develop sepsis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulable state may increase the risk of developing DVT.
5. Stroke: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of a cerebrovascular accident (stroke).
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient does not have a known history of diabetes mellitus, the hyperglycemic state may progress to DKA if not managed appropriately.

Please note that the information provided is a summary of the patient's progress note,"
193457.0,204615,2123-04-18 07:15:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint:
   He initially lost his DP/PT in his left leg, and warming blankets were
   placed peripherally with recovery of his pulse
    overnight he received 4L IVF with  improvement of his lactate from 5.1
   to 2.7 closing of his anion gap with UOP 30-40cc/hr maintaing BPs with
   MAPs in the 80s. Around 6:30pm his maps dropped to the high 50
s, his
   UOP trailed off, amnio off, sedation decreased, fluids wide open,
   dobutamine was started peripherally and a central line was placed.
   He was shivering significantly with subsequent warming, initially got
   vecuronium boluses x 2 then started on vecuronium drip.
   His GFS ranged 300s to 400s with humalog given, and was started on an
   insulin drip this am.
   On Telemetry  he was in sinus with PVCs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who suffered from a STEMI in the field and had ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was resuscitated and underwent reperfusion therapy with a bare metal stent to the left anterior descending artery. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a ventricular fibrillation arrest in the field, and while he was successfully resuscitated, there is concern for potential recurrent cardiac arrest due to compromised pump function and possible stent thrombosis.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely secondary to his cardiac condition and possible valvular compromise. Close monitoring and aggressive management with inotropic support are required.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated lactic acid level, indicating potential tissue hypoperfusion. Metabolic acidosis is also supported by the presence of an anion gap. Immediate IV fluids and close monitoring of electrolytes are necessary.
4. Hyperglycemia: Despite no known history of diabetes, the patient is hyperglycemic. Insulin therapy may be needed to control blood glucose levels.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to a stress response, aspiration pneumonia, or another underlying infection. Further evaluation and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male who experienced a STEMI and ventricular fibrillation arrest in the field. He was resuscitated and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Post-procedure, the patient developed hypotension and required dobutamine for cardiac support. He also has been diagnosed with metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, and bowel reg. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has a central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest due to ongoing ischemia or stent thrombosis.
2. Persistent hypotension and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia may progress to diabetic ketoacidosis or worsen if not managed appropriately.
4. Leukocytosis could indicate an infection or stress response.
5. Bowel reg may progress to bowel ischemia or perforation if not managed promptly.
6. Complications related to mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
7. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
8. Stress ulcer due to critical illness and prolonged intubation.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male who had a heart attack and suffered from ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and poor renal function. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of VF arrest and STEMI indicates a high risk for recurrent cardiac arrest.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (MAPs in the 80s) suggests poor perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: Elevated lactic acid levels indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an infection or stress response.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control and increased risk for complications such as infections.
6. Poor Renal Function: The elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate renal dysfunction, which can further complicate the patient's overall condition.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation suggests respiratory failure or severe lung compromise.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who suffered from a STEMI in the field with ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was found to have total occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and underwent reperfusion with bare metal stent placement in the LAD. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, poor forward flow indicated by renal failure, and metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate level. He also has leukocytosis, likely due to a stress response or aspiration. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is in the 300s-400s range, indicating altered mental status. He is sedated with fentanyl and versed, and has an endotracheal tube in place for mechanical ventilation.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, history of trauma, and psoriasis. He has undergone several interventions, including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement, and is currently receiving multiple medications such as aspirin, heparin, atorvastatin, integrillin, and Plavix.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient received 3 liters of IVF with improvement in lactate levels from 5.1 to 2.7, closing the anion gap.
- The patient was shivering significantly and received vecuronium boluses and a vecuronium drip to manage the shivering.
- The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ranged from 300s to 400s, and Humalog was given, with the initiation of an insulin drip this morning.
- The patient required invasive ventilation support, nasal swab testing, arterial line placement, and urine culture testing.
- The patient has multiple allergies and is currently on several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, amiodarone, eptifibatide (Integrilin), and others.
- The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP 67/56 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 69 bpm). The patient's temperature is low at 33.7°C (92.7°F).
- The patient's respiratory support consists of endotracheal tube ventilation with a set tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and a FiO2 of 50%.
- The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.22, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, HCO3 of 151 mEq/L, and a base excess of -13.
- Physical examination reveals sluggish and equal pupils that react to light but constrict from 6mm to 3mm, with mute reflexes, flat Babinski sign, no withdrawal from painful stimuli, and no response to voice or sound.
- The patient's neck brace is in place, making it difficult to assess the jugular venous pressure (JVP). The patient has distant heart sounds with a regular rate and rhythm, clear breath sounds anteriorly, and no murmurs or gallops.
- The patient has mottled/purplish extremities, slow capillary refill, and diminished peripheral pulses.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 26.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 45.4%, and increased creatinine (Cr) of 1.7.
- The patient's glucose level is significantly elevated at 390 mg/dL.
- The patient has a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis and suffered a STEMI in the field with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- The patient is on aspirin (ASA), heparin IV, atorvastatin, integrilin, and Plavix"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was stabilized. However, the patient experienced a recurrent episode of hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest, resulting in a non-shockable rhythm on cardiac monitoring.

Overnight Events:
- The patient had a large amount of old blood from the nasogastric tube (NGT).
- The patient was bleeding significantly from lines, NGT, etc., with elevated fibrinogen levels.
- Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was started.
- Arterial line was removed.
- Sputum culture was obtained.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who suffered a STEMI in the field with ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was found to have total occlusion in the left anterior descending artery and underwent reperfusion with bare-metal stenting to the LAD. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension since the arrest, and it is unclear about the pump function due to the lack of an echo yet. Stent thrombosis is a possibility, along with valvular compromise. Continuous dobutamine until central line placement may be considered, and dopamine could also be considered for its inotropic effects.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactic acid level. A tox screen was negative for ethanol, and there is no known history of diabetes but the patient is hyperglycemic. A urine analysis for ketones should be done, and IV fluids should be given to close the anion gap.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, possibly due to a stress response or aspiration. A follow-up urine culture should be performed.

4. Respiratory Complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who suffered a STEMI in the field with VF arrest. He underwent reperfusion with bare-metal stenting to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient has undergone cooling/rewarming, and an EEG is planned for 48 hours per protocol. He is currently on ASA, atorvastatin, and Plavix, with plans to continue these medications. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, and pressors are being weaned off as tolerated. He remains intubated and sedated, with a fever and hypothermia. The patient has a history of trauma, including a negative CT spine and torso but potential c-spine trauma, for which he will continue to have neck immobilization and neuro monitoring. There is evidence of aspiration, and the patient's hematocrit has dropped from 50 to 40 due to bloody fluid in the NGT. Leukocytosis is also present but likely due to a stress response. The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing hypotension and weaning of pressors.
2. Infection risk due to prolonged intubation and sedation.
3. Respiratory complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who experienced a STEMI in the field with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He was found to have a total occlusion in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and underwent reperfusion therapy with balloon angioplasty and stent placement in the LAD. The patient developed respiratory distress overnight, with a chest X-ray showing pulmonary edema. He received lasix boluses and nitroglycerin, which improved his urine output. He was initially on BiPAP but was able to be weaned down. The patient's ejection fraction is severely depressed at 20-25%, and he has global hypokinesis. Other findings include mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderately dilated left ventricular cavity, trivial mitral regurgitation, and trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The patient also has a history of trauma, with negative CT spine and torso except for aspiration. He is currently alert, oriented to person and year, able to move all four extremities on command, and has distant heart sounds with regular rhythm. His blood pressure is 116/72 mmHg, heart rate is 100 bpm, respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94% on CPAP mask.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7300**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Had episode of flash pulmonary edema yesterday with significant bilat
   infiltrates on CXR.  Responded to lasix IV with >2.5 L diuresis and
   better this AM.  BP 92/60.
   EF 25% on echo.
   Physical Examination
   somewhat disoriented and confused but conversant
   no murmurs
   Medical Decision Making
   With large MI, will start coumadin with heparin bridge.
   Will discontinue Amio.
   Will need reeval in 6 wks for possible AICD.
   BB being titrated.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who experienced a STEMI in the field and was found to have a total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient underwent reperfusion therapy with bare metal stent placement in the LAD.

Overnight events include the patient developing respiratory distress with extensive bilateral opacities on chest X-ray, suggestive of pulmonary edema. The patient received two boluses of Lasix and nitroglycerin, resulting in good urine output. The patient was initially on BiPAP but was able to be weaned down.

The patient is now off pressors and will continue to be monitored for blood pressure. The patient's rhythm has transitioned from ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest to sinus tachycardia. The patient has completed an intravenous amiodarone load and will switch to oral amiodarone.

The patient also experienced trauma, with a CT scan of the spine and torso showing no significant findings except for aspiration. However, the neuro team had concerns about possible cervical spine trauma, but the patient is now moving all four extremities spontaneously. The patient's hematocrit level dropped initially but has now stabilized.

The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, which is likely due to a stress response. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 25% based on an echocardiogram.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male who had a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis. He suffered a STEMI in the field with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He was found to have triple vessel disease, specifically involving the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and underwent reperfusion therapy with bare metal stent placement in the LAD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI: The patient had a STEMI, which is a serious condition caused by a complete blockage of one of the heart's arteries. It can lead to permanent damage to the heart muscle if not promptly treated.
2. VF arrest: The patient experienced a VF arrest, which is a life-threatening heart rhythm that can lead to cardiac arrest. Immediate defibrillation is crucial in such cases.
3. LAD involvement: The patient has triple vessel disease with involvement of the LAD artery. This artery supplies blood to the front and largest portion of the left ventricle. Complications may arise if there is further blockage or damage to this artery.
4. Reperfusion therapy: The patient underwent reperfusion therapy with bare metal stent placement in the LAD. Complications related to stent placement, such as restenosis or stent thrombosis, can occur.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has been experiencing fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate, indicating hemodynamic instability. This may be due to myocardial dysfunction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, hyperglycemia, altered mental status, and knowledge deficit. The patient was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation and dobutamine therapy. The patient's ejection fraction is estimated to be 20-25%. The patient's respiratory distress and decreasing oxygen saturations led to the initiation of Lasix, morphine, nitro, oxygen, and positioning, which resulted in improvement. The patient has a known allergy to amiodarone and has received metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and furosemide (Lasix) infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/72 mmHg to 120s/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg and fluid balance within normal limits. The patient is on CPAP mode with FiO2 set at 60%, PS of 5 cmH2O, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 94%. The patient's ABG results are within normal limits, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 133.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These complications include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is tachypneic with coarse crackles on auscultation, and a chest X-ray showed fluffy bilateral infiltrates. This indicates possible pulmonary edema, but it could also be due to aspiration pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood sugar levels.

3. Cardiac Arrest and Myocardial Infarction: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation and was successfully resuscitated. A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement and a 24-hour cooling protocol. The patient's cardiac enzymes peaked three days ago and are now coming down.

4. Reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF): An echocardiogram post-cooling protocol revealed an LVEF of 20-25% with global hypokinesis. The patient is currently stable without the need for pressors or dilators. The patient has been started on metoprolol, hepar"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hyperglycemia, and cardiac arrest. He has a history of STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient also has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25% with global hypokinesis.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, heparin, and coumadin. He is being treated with vanc/cefepime/flagyl for respiratory distress, which is likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The cause of ARDS is unclear but occurred in the setting of low-grade fever and good diuresis. The patient may have aspiration pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, ventilator-associated pneumonia, sepsis, further cardiac complications, and neurologic complications. The patient's agitation may be related to neurologic dysfunction or hypoperfusion, and an MRI brain with DWI or ADC is recommended to assess for biparietal hypoperfusion. Additionally, the patient's neck stability should be evaluated due to the aspiration incident, and an MRI of the neck may be necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ systems involved. Close monitoring and management are required"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary edema. He also has altered mental status and agitation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing tachypnea with coarse crackles on auscultation, and there are fluffy bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray. These findings suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and repeat chest X-rays may be necessary.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and careful monitoring are essential.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of STEMI with VF arrest and is currently on metoprolol for rhythm control. Continuous telemetry monitoring should be maintained to detect any abnormal heart rhythms promptly.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobilization and reduced mobility, there is an increased risk of DVT. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin is already being administered.
5. Neurological sequelae: The patient has altered mental status and is disoriented. An MRI brain with DWI or ADC may be needed to determine the prognosis of anterograde amnesia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is likely experiencing pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The positive sputum culture with moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus suggests a bacterial infection. The plan includes continuing antibiotics, increasing the dose of Vancomycin, using ipratropium nebulizer as needed, reviewing chest X-ray, and repeating arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.

2. Cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction (STEMI): The patient experienced a cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation and was found to have a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A thrombus in the left anterior descending artery was observed during cardiac catheterization, and the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. Elevated liver function tests may be related to the recent myocardial infarction. Medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril are being continued. Trends in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests are being monitored.

3. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated to be 20-25% with global hypokinesis. This suggests reduced heart function. The patient is currently stable"

","Based on the provided information, the patient has multiple medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has been agitated multiple times and is currently managed with haldol or morphine. This indicates potential delirium or cognitive dysfunction.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory distress, possibly due to pneumonia, aspiration, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The positive sputum culture showing moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus and sparse growth of gram-negative rods suggests a bacterial infection. Controlling antibiotics and reviewing the chest X-ray are recommended.

3. Coronary artery disease: The patient had a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) with VF (ventricular fibrillation) arrest. A thrombus in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was found during catheterization, and the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent placement. There is also evidence of elevated liver function tests (LFTs) post-MI. Continuing aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril, along with monitoring cardiac enzymes and LFTs, is advised.

4. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25% with global hypokinesis. Blood pressure is currently stable without the need for pressors or vasodilators"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who experienced a STEMI in the field with VF arrest. He was found to have total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and underwent reperfusion with bare metal stent placement in the LAD. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with several ongoing medical complications.

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is showing signs of respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia, aspiration, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The positive sputum culture indicates the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods, and Bacillus species.

2. Coronaries: The patient had a STEMI with VF arrest and total occlusion of the LAD. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with BMS placement and cooling protocol. Ongoing management includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), statin, beta-blocker (metoprolol), and anticoagulation (heparin and Coumadin) for thromboembolism prevention.

3. Pump Dysfunction: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is severely reduced at 20-25% with global hypokinesis. He is currently hemodynamically stable without the need for vasopressors or inotropes."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male who experienced a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) in the field and underwent reperfusion with bare metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient also had ventricular fibrillation arrest and was resuscitated.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia, which could be aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sputum culture shows moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive, sparse growth of gram-negative rods, and sparse growth of Bacillus species (not Anthracis).

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The treatment plan includes increasing the dose of vancomycin, administering ipratropium nebulizer treatment as needed, aiming for negative 1 L fluid balance for the day, trending ABG (arterial blood gas) results, following up with blood culture, considering resumption of BiPAP if the patient deteriorates, and treating agitation as mentioned below.

In terms of coronary care, the patient had a STEMI with VF arrest and total occlusion of LAD, for which he received a BMS (bare metal stent). He is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. Continuous monitoring for any"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He has a history of STEMI with VF arrest and was found to have a total occlusion of the LAD on cath. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement and cooling protocol. The patient also has an echocardiogram showing LVEF of 20-25% with global hypokinesis. He was started on metoprolol, heparin, and coumadin for LV hypokinesis. The patient's LFTs are elevated, with AST, ALT, and LDH likely related to recent MI. There is also an elevated T.Bili with unclear etiology. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is more oriented this morning. Neuro recommends waiting for two weeks to determine the prognosis of anterograde amnesia. An MRI brain with DWI or ADC is recommended when the patient is stable. The patient has been treated with various medications, including vanc, cefepime, flagyl, ipratropium neb, and haldol. The patient's sputum culture shows moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus coag positive, sparse growth of gram-negative rods, and sparse growth of Bacillus species (not anthracis). The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to pneumonia, possibly aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who experienced a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) in the field with VF (ventricular fibrillation) arrest. He was found to have total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and underwent reperfusion with a bare-metal stent (BMS) to the LAD.

- The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia or aspiration, with possible contribution from congestive heart failure. He has been improving this morning.

- The patient's coronaries show a STEMI with VF arrest. He had a total occlusion of the LAD, which was treated with BMS placement. He has been on a cooling protocol.

- The patient's hypotension etiology is unclear, with possible causes including hypovolemia related to aggressive diuresis, medication side effects, or evolving sepsis in the setting of pneumonia.

- The patient's heart function is compromised, with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25% and global hypokinesis. He is currently stable without the need for pressors or dilators and has been started on metoprolol for blood pressure control, as well as heparin and coumadin for thromboembol"

   sputum culture as above. There is also a component of anxiety/agitation
   related to the patient
s episodes of respiratory distress as well.
   - Cont current abx: vanc, cefepime, flagyl
   - Vanc dose increased as per pharm recs; will check level with AM labs
   tomorrow
   - Ipratropium neb PRN

   # Elevated LFT
s: Pt with elevated LFT
s noted on lab work. Elevated
   AST, ALT, and LDH likely related to recent MI. However, etiology of
   elevated T.Bili not entirely clear.

   Disposition: CCU for now
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who suffered a STEMI in the field with VF arrest. He was found to have total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and underwent reperfusion with bare metal stent placement in the LAD. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is likely experiencing pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A positive sputum culture supports this diagnosis. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the dosage of vancomycin has been increased as per pharmacist recommendations. The plan includes continuing the current antibiotics, administering ipratropium nebulizer treatment as needed, aiming for negative fluid balance, trending ABG, and considering the resumption of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) if the patient deteriorates.

2. Coronaries: The patient had a STEMI with VF arrest and was found to have total occlusion of the LAD. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement. The patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. Monitoring for any recurrence of chest pain is essential.

3. Pump: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is severely reduced"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who experienced a STEMI in the field with VF arrest. He was found to have total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and underwent reperfusion with bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the LAD. The patient has been in the ICU since admission.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia or aspiration, with possible contribution from congestive heart failure. His chest X-ray shows left lower lobe pneumonia, and sputum is growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) as well as gram negatives. The antibiotics cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole were continued, while ipratropium nebs were also initiated.

The patient also has a history of STEMI with VF arrest and was found to have total occlusion of the LAD on catheterization. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with BMS placement in the LAD. He has been started on aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

Additionally, the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 20-25% with global hypokinesis. He has been started on metoprolol for blood pressure control, he"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with hx of cholecystectomy/psoriasis who suffered STEMI in
   field with VF arrest found to have TO LAD, s/p reperfusion with BMS to
   LAD.
   # Respiratory distress: Likely due to pneumonia/aspiration, with
   possible contribution from congestive heart failure. Improved this a.m.
   CXR consistent with LLL pneumonia, and sputum growing MSSA as well as
   gram negatives.
   - continue cefepime; vanc and flagyl d/c
ed yesterday
   - continue ipratropium nebs
   - continue to monitor I/O
s today; no diuresis at this point
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # STEMI with VF arrest. Found to have total occlusion of LAD on cath.
   s/p BMS. S/p cooling protocol. Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, lisinopril.
   - Continue to monitor for any recurrence of chest pain
   - continue telemetry
   .
   # Pump: Echo post cooling protocol reveals LVEF 20-25% with global
   hypokinesis. Started him on metoprolol 25 TID for BP, heparin and
   coumadin for LV hypokinesis. INR now therapeutic; heparin gtt stopped.
   - continue coumadin
   - Follow coags
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to antihypertensive regimen. Pt does not
   appear septic on exam.
   - Holding diuresis for now
   - Hold parameters on BP meds
   .
   # Elevated LFT
s: Pt with elevated LFT
s. Trending down. Likely related
   to recent MI. Will need further evaluation (inpatieint vs. outpatient)
   if LFT abnormalities fail to resolve completely.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Neuro: Mental status seems to be improving. Per neuro recs, it may
   take weeks to months for mental status to clear and there may be some
   residual defecits.
   - consider MRI brain (inpt vs. outpt)
   - outpatient neuro f/u
   - haldol for agitation

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who experienced a STEMI in the field with ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was found to have total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and underwent reperfusion with bare-metal stenting (BMS) to the LAD. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory distress due to pneumonia or aspiration, with possible contribution from congestive heart failure. His condition improved this morning, and he is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen with ipratropium nebs.
2. STEMI with VF Arrest: The patient had a STEMI with ventricular fibrillation arrest and underwent BMS to the LAD. He is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. Telemetry monitoring is ongoing for any recurrence of chest pain.
3. Pump Dysfunction: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 20-25% with global hypokinesis. He has been started on metoprolol for blood pressure control, heparin, and coumadin for LV hypokinesis. INR is now therapeutic, and the heparin drip has been stopped.
4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, knowledge deficit, hyperglycemia, and cardiac arrest. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show low blood pressure. The patient has received multiple antibiotics for pneumonia and has been weaned off heparin due to therapeutic INR levels. Fluid balance shows a positive intake of 2,033 mL and output of 1,560 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 473 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's renal function is within normal limits. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and troponin-T) are elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's electrolytes are relatively stable, except for a slightly low calcium level. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 104 mg/dL. The patient's antibiotic regimen includes cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient is also receiving systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU, with a code status of full code.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who suffered a STEMI in the field and experienced ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was found to have total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and underwent reperfusion with a bare metal stent (BMS) to the LAD. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown improvements in respiratory distress, which is likely due to pneumonia or aspiration, with possible contribution from congestive heart failure. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially experienced respiratory distress likely due to pneumonia or aspiration, with possible contribution from congestive heart failure. However, there has been improvement in the patient's condition.
2. Coronaries: The patient had a STEMI with VF arrest and was found to have total occlusion of the LAD. He underwent reperfusion with a BMS to the LAD. The patient will continue on aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.
3. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear. It may be related to hypovolemia in the setting of aggressive diuresis or could be due to BP medications. Other possibilities include evolving sepsis in the setting of pneumonia.
4. Pump failure: An echocardiogram post-cooling protocol revealed a left ventricular ejection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy and psoriasis who experienced a STEMI in the field and had ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was found to have total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and underwent reperfusion with a bare metal stent (BMS) placement in the LAD. The patient also received a cooling protocol.

The patient is currently being treated for several conditions. Firstly, he is being treated for respiratory distress, likely due to pneumonia or aspiration, with possible contribution from congestive heart failure. Secondly, he is being treated for his coronary artery disease, specifically the STEMI with VF arrest, for which he had a BMS placed in the LAD. Thirdly, he is being treated for hypotension, the etiology of which is unclear but may be related to hypovolemia, diuretics, or evolving sepsis in the setting of pneumonia. Fourthly, he is being treated for left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-25% and global hypokinesis, as revealed by an echocardiogram post-cooling protocol. Lastly, he has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) that are trending down, likely related to the recent myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress if his pneumonia or aspiration worsens. This"
