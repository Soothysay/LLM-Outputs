","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of asthma, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with dyspnea, falls, and EKG changes. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, microcytic anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and falls. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still experiencing hypoxemia. He has received treatment for asthma exacerbation, including nebs and steroids, and is currently on low flow oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's cardiac condition indicates possible cardiac ischemia, and he has been started on aspirin, Plavix, statin, and heparin. His anemia has been managed with packed red blood cell transfusion. The patient's renal function shows signs of acute on chronic renal failure, and he is being monitored closely. The patient's recent echo report reveals moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. His pulmonary pressures are also elevated. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU pending clinical stability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced respiratory failure, which may recur if his asthma is not well-controlled or if he develops any complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac Ischemia:"

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of asthma, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and multiple cardiovascular risk factors. He presented with dyspnea, falls, and electrocardiogram (EKG) changes. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, microcytic anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and falls.

Respiratory Failure:
The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, possibly due to an asthma exacerbation. However, he improved with nebulizers and steroids. A chest X-ray did not show sufficient infiltrate or effusion to explain the hypoxia. The patient's respiratory support includes albuterol/ipratropium and steroids. He is being treated for possible ICU-acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone. The plan is to discontinue vancomycin and Tamiflu today. A chest CT is needed for further evaluation.

Cardiac Ischemia:
The patient presented with symptoms of cardiac ischemia, including dyspnea, focal EKG changes, elevated cardiac enzymes, and new focal wall motion abnormalities. The echocardiogram changes may be old, and the patient could have demand ischemia in the setting of anemia. The treatment plan for cardiac ischemia includes aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, and heparin infusion. The goal heart rate is 60-80 beats per minute, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of asthma, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with dyspnea, falls, and EKG changes. The patient initially required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NRB) due to respiratory failure, but was weaned off as his condition improved with nebulizers and steroids. There are no significant findings on chest X-ray. The patient has multiple cardiovascular risk factors and presented with dyspnea, focal EKG changes, cardiac enzyme elevations, and new focal wall motion abnormalities. An echocardiogram showed mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient also has microcytic anemia with profound iron deficiency and acute on chronic renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, which required NRB. This could be due to an asthma exacerbation or another underlying cause. Continuous monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and respiratory status is necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient presented with dyspnea, focal EKG changes, cardiac enzyme elevations, and new focal wall motion abnormalities. These findings suggest possible cardiac ischemia. The patient is currently receiving antiplatelet therapy, statin, he"

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of asthma, hypertension, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presented with respiratory distress, ischemic ECG changes, and positive cardiac markers. The patient's condition is uncertain, with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or demand ischemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/97 mmHg to 185/130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on 5 liters nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including heparin, aspirin, and Plavix, as well as antibiotics for a possible upper airway infection. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels, with slightly abnormal kidney function tests and electrolyte levels.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals worsening bilateral multifocal opacities, with the worst appearance in the right upper lung zone and also in the lower lobes. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows left and right atrial dilation, normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size, mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation,"

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and distal septal segments, as
   well as of the apex and distal inferior wall. The remaining segments
   contract normally (LVEF = 40%), most c/w multivessel CAD. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.1 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
   There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to
   mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
   is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild aortic
   regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of asthma, hypertension, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted with respiratory distress, ischemic ECG changes, and positive cardiac markers, raising the possibility of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or demand ischemia. 

The patient has received various interventions and treatments, including cardiac consultations, ENT evaluation, antibiotic administration, and medication adjustments. His vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but slightly elevated respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 93% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging tests, such as a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), reveal left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of ischemia, respiratory distress, and other potential complications. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU for his condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y o man with asthma, HTN, h/o CVA, admitted with respiratory
   distress, ischemic ECG changes and positive cardiac markers, ?ACS vs.
   demand ischemia
   1. Ischemia: ACS vs. demand, no clear source of demand, CXR with
   ?multifocal PNA, now worsening appearance, anemic on admission but Hct
   improved with transfusions.  Troponin slightly up this morning, CK-MB
   stable.  Unable to assess whether or not he is having CP [**3-1**] aphasia,
   but has not been c/o it at home.
   - Continue asa/plavix/heparin
   - Daily ECGs
   - F/up cardiology recs
   2.  Respiratory distress:   CXR suggestive of atypical pna, ?influenza
   despite neg swab. H/o asthma, exp wheezes that are more prominent
   centrally, scope by ENT w/out an upper airway source. ?TBM.  O2 needs
   coming down.
   - D/c vanco
   - Continue CTX + levo
   - Continue tamiflu x 5 days, cont flu precautions
   - F/up blood cultures
   - check urine legionella ag, mycoplasma serologies
   - continue nebs
   - ?IP evaluation for ?TBM once acute issues resolved
   3. Anemia: Hct 22 on admisison, improved to 33 p 2 units.  Likely
   chronic GIB given microcytosis.
   - continue to keep Hct > 30 given ACS vs. demand ischemia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of asthma, hypertension, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted with respiratory distress, ischemic ECG changes, and positive cardiac markers, leading to uncertainty about whether he is experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or demand ischemia. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Ischemia: ACS vs. demand ischemia - The patient has evidence of ischemia, but the source is unclear. There is a concern for coronary artery disease (CAD), as indicated by regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and multivessel CAD seen on echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and heparin.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, and his chest X-ray suggests worsening bilateral multifocal opacities, most prominently in the right upper lung zone. This may indicate atypical pneumonia, possibly influenza, despite a negative swab. The patient also has a history of asthma, which could be contributing to the respiratory issues. There is a suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) due to the central wheezes and scope by ENT showing no upper airway source. The patient requires ongoing oxygen therapy.

3. Anemia: The patient presented with anemia, with a hematocrit (Hct) of 22% on admission. After receiving two units of blood transf"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of asthma, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with dyspnea, falls, and EKG changes. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient has been treated for several medical complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient initially received nasal cannula with low air movement, consistent with asthma exacerbation. However, the patient improved with nebulizers (nebs) and steroids. The chest X-ray does not show sufficient infiltrate or effusion to explain the hypoxia. The plan is to hold albuterol/ipratropium, continue steroids, treat ICU CAP with levofloxacin/ceftriaxone, discontinue vancomycin, and administer Tamiflu empirically for 5 days. A chest CT will be needed for lung nodule evaluation and tracheal assessment at some point.

2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient presented with dyspnea, focal EKG changes, cardiac enzyme elevations, and new focal wall motion abnormalities. Echo changes may be old, but the patient could have demand ischemia in the setting of anemia. The treatment plan includes aspirin, Plavix, statin, heparin gtt x 48 hr, beta-blocker with a goal heart rate of 60-80, and maintaining hemoglobin concentration (Hct) greater than 30.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of asthma, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with dyspnea, falls, and EKG changes. He is currently admitted to the ICU for medical management.

The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, which is improving. It is believed to be primarily due to obstruction rather than pneumonia versus influenza exacerbating his asthma. Treatment includes albuterol/ipratroprium, pulse steroids, and treating ICU CAP with Levo/CTX. Tamiflu has been given empirically for 5 days, and a chest CT is needed for further evaluation of lung nodule and tracheal assessment at some point.

The patient also presents with cardiac ischemia. He has multiple cardiovascular risk factors and presented with dyspnea, focal EKG changes, cardiac enzyme elevations, and new focal wall motion abnormalities. Echo changes may be old, and he could have demand ischemia in the setting of anemia. The treatment plan includes ASA, Plavix, statin, heparin gtt x 48 hr, beta-blocker with a goal HR of 60-80, and Hct goal > 30.

   for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his / her note
   above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   85yoM with h/o CVA, presented with dyspnea and increasing falls.  On
   day of admission he had several falls and became somnolent.  Brought to
   ED, noted to be in respiratory distress and placed on NRB.  Given PRBC
   and ASA.  CXR with RUL PNA; treated with solumedrol, levofloxacin,
   flagyl.
   24 Hour Events:
   Admitted to ICU; evaluated by ENT for possible upper airway obstruction
   and felt to have normal upper airway anatomy.  He was continued on
   ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.  He received nebulizers because of
   bronchospasm, so was also started on prednisone.  Had improvement in
   oxygenation with nebulizers.  Overall improved from admission.
   CK/Troponin peaked yesterday morning. Elevation thought secondary to
   demand ischemia in setting of infection and respiratory distress.  Seen
   by cardiology, suggested heparin/plavix/ASA.  TTE with focal WMA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with dyspnea and increasing falls. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and placed on non-rebreather mask (NRB). The patient received packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and aspirin (ASA). A chest X-ray revealed right upper lobe pneumonia (RUL PNA), and he was treated with solumedrol, levofloxacin, and flagyl.

In the ICU, the patient's condition improved with nebulizers for bronchospasm and the addition of prednisone. He was evaluated by ENT for possible upper airway obstruction and had a normal upper airway anatomy. The patient continued on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. His oxygenation improved with nebulizers, and he showed overall improvement from admission.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated troponin and CK levels, which were thought to be secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of infection and respiratory distress. He was seen by cardiology and suggested to be on heparin, plavix, and ASA. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with focal wall motion abnormality (WMA) was noted.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the
   for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his / her note
   above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   85yoM with h/o CVA, presented with dyspnea and increasing falls.  On
   day of admission he had several falls and became somnolent.  Brought to
   ED, noted to be in respiratory distress and placed on NRB.  Given PRBC
   and ASA.  CXR with RUL PNA; treated with solumedrol, levofloxacin,
   flagyl.
   24 Hour Events:
   Admitted to ICU; evaluated by ENT for possible upper airway obstruction
   and felt to have normal upper airway anatomy.  He was continued on
   ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.  He received nebulizers because of
   bronchospasm, so was also started on prednisone.  Had improvement in
   oxygenation with nebulizers.  Overall improved from admission.
   CK/Troponin peaked yesterday morning. Elevation thought secondary to
   demand ischemia in setting of infection and respiratory distress.  Seen
   by cardiology, suggested heparin/plavix/ASA.  TTE with focal WMA.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with dyspnea, increasing falls, and somnolence. He was admitted to the emergency department, noted to be in respiratory distress, and placed on non-rebreather mask. The patient received packed red blood cells and aspirin. A chest X-ray showed right upper lobe pneumonia (RUL PNA), and he was treated with solumedrol, levofloxacin, and flagyl. He was also evaluated by ENT for possible upper airway obstruction and felt to have normal upper airway anatomy. In the ICU, the patient received nebulizers due to bronchospasm and was started on prednisone. His oxygenation improved with nebulizers, and overall improved from admission. The patient's troponin and CK levels peaked, with elevation thought secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of infection and respiratory distress. He was seen by cardiology, suggesting heparin/plavix/ASA. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with focal wall motion abnormality (WMA) was performed. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently on various medications including heparin sodium, ASA, levofloxacin, oseltamivir, metoprolol, colace, PPI, insulin sliding scale, and prednisone 40mg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with dyspnea and increasing falls. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and received oxygen therapy. The patient has been treated for right upper lobe pneumonia (RUL PNA) with antibiotics, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids. His condition improved, but he developed hypoxemia again. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is alert with aphasia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin T levels, and lactate levels. Imaging shows bilateral interstitial markings consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient is being treated for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and asthma, and further evaluation for influenza and cardiac issues is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has RUL PNA, which can lead to respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxemia, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: Elevated troponin T levels suggest possible cardiac ischemia, which may progress to myocardial infarction if not managed appropriately.
3. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient's bronchospasm indicates an asthma exacerbation, which can result in respiratory distress and hypoxemia.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and further deterioration of renal function may occur"
