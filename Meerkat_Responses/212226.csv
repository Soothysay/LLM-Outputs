1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and recent hip surgery increases the risk of aspiration. The CT chest showed nodular consolidation and fluid in the trachea and esophagus, suggesting possible aspiration event.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The CT angiogram (CTA) revealed a small PE at the left lower lobe ant basal segment branch point. This increases the risk of further embolic events and right ventricular strain.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment for C. difficile and a urinary tract infection (UTI), the patient's fever persists. Other potential causes of FUO should be investigated.
4. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes may be due to morphine in the emergency department or an underlying delirium.

   difficle colitis, recent admission for R hip fracture s/p ORIF
   complicated by urosepsis and respiratory failure who was discharged to
   rehab yesterday and returns for respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  Currently at baseline O2 requirements.  Likely
   aspiration event in the setting of pulmonary HTN and COPD.  She was
   also noted to have nodular consolidation and fluid in trachea and
   esophagus susp for aspiration pneumonitis.  Patient has severe
   pulmonary hypertension on sildenafil and bosenten.  CXR suggests mild
   pulmonary edema, likely worsened by tachycardia (driven by fever,
   pain).  CTA chest showed singular small PE at LLL ant basal segment
   branch point, left pleural effusion, & bibasal atelectasis.  I do not
   see a significant pulmonary infiltrate.
   - O2 by NC with goal O2 sat of 88-94%.

   stable from discharge.  She does does have c. diff and was found to
   have pan-sensitive Klebsiella/E. colic UTI on appropriate abx since
   [**10-9**].  Neg. U/A.  Repeat UCx pending.  She is intermittently tachypneic
   to 40s, but CT chest showed no sig. infiltrate.  [**Month (only) 51**] be from
   asipration.  Per Ortho, R hip does not appear infected.  There is
   erythema just around the incision over her R hip.  PICC line was placed
   yesterday and site appears benign.  Other considerations include drug
   fever.  She also has a PE but appears small.
   - monitor fever curve (note on standing tylenol for pain)

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). She is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient also has a fever of 101.3Â°F, and there is suspicion of aspiration. She has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), and her condition requires close monitoring. The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) and Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), which have been treated. Her hip wound is stable without signs of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress, coupled with known PAH and COPD, increases the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD.
2. Fevers: The persistent fever despite treatment for C. diff and UTI suggests the possibility of another underlying infection, which needs to be identified and addressed promptly to prevent sepsis.
3. Neurological Status: The patient's waxing and waning mental status could indicate neurological complications like delirium or even seizures. Close observation and further evaluation are necessary to determine the cause and provide appropriate management.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The acute PE diagnosis poses a risk for further thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Ant"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 10607**] is a 60 yo F with CAD s/p IMI, CHF s/p
   AICD, SLE, scleroderma, severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home O2, C.
   difficle colitis, recent admission for R hip fracture s/p ORIF
   complicated by urosepsis and respiratory failure who was discharged to
   rehab yesterday and returns for respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  Currently at baseline O2 requirements.  Likely
   aspiration event in the setting of pulmonary HTN and COPD.  She was
   also noted to have nodular consolidation and fluid in trachea and
   esophagus susp for aspiration pneumonitis.  Patient has severe
   pulmonary hypertension on sildenafil and bosenten.  CXR suggests mild
   pulmonary edema, likely worsened by tachycardia (driven by fever,
   pain).  CTA chest showed singular small PE at LLL ant basal segment
   branch point, left pleural effusion, & bibasal atelectasis.  I do not
   see a significant pulmonary infiltrate.
   - O2 by NC with goal O2 sat of 88-94%.
   - cont. pulmonary HTN treatment with sildenafil and viagra
   - rate control adequately with metoprolol
   - Lasix IV for goal -1L today

   # Fever:  In last 24 hours prior to discharge, Tmax was 99.6.  In last
   48 hours prior to discharge, Tmax was 102.1 on [**10-14**].  Leukocytosis
   stable from discharge.  She does does have c. diff and was found to
   have pan-sensitive Klebsiella/E. colic UTI on appropriate abx since
   [**10-9**].  Neg. U/A.  Repeat UCx pending.  She is intermittently tachypneic
   to 40s, but CT chest showed no sig. infiltrate.  [**Month (only) 51**] be from
   asipration.  Per Ortho, R hip does not appear infected.  There is
   erythema just around the incision over her R hip.  PICC line was placed
   yesterday and site appears benign.  Other considerations include drug
   fever.  She also has a PE but appears small.
   - monitor fever curve (note on standing tylenol for pain)
   - sputum culture
   - follow up urine, blood cultures (OSH # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10809**])
   - cont po vanc for C. diff
   - vanc/cefepime pending 48 hours of negative culture data
   - US RUE to r/o thrombosis (on anticoagulation anyway)
   # C. difficle colitis:  No evidence of megacolon.

   week, 125mg QOD x 1 week, 125mg q3 days x 2 weeks.
   # MAT vs afib:  BP stable but HR suboptimally controlled.  Worsened by
   fever, PE, post-op pain.  In addition, at rehab she was only given 50
   metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**].
   - cont. metoprolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 7**] to improve filling time
   - control pain with standing tylenol, limit narcotics

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known lastname 10607] is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-intravenous myocardial infarction (IMI), congestive heart failure (CHF) post-artificial cardiac defibrillator (AICD) implantation, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension (PHN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen therapy, Clostridium difficile colitis, and a recent admission for right hip fracture surgery (ORIF) complicated by urosepsis and respiratory failure. She was discharged to rehabilitation but returned due to respiratory distress.

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress at baseline oxygen requirements, likely due to aspiration in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and COPD. She also has nodular consolidation and fluid in the trachea and esophagus, suggesting aspiration pneumonitis. The chest X-ray shows mild pulmonary edema, likely worsened by tachycardia driven by fever and pain. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest revealed a singular small pulmonary embolism (PE) at the left lower lobe (LLL) anterobasal segment branch point, left pleural effusion, and bibasal atelectasis. There is no significant pulmonary infiltrate seen.

The patient's fever has been present in the last 24 hours"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe pulmonary hypertension, COPD, C. difficile colitis, and previous admission for right hip fracture surgery complicated by urosepsis and respiratory failure. She presented with respiratory distress due to aspiration pneumonitis, and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showed subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, therapeutic anticoagulation, diuretics, and medications for pulmonary hypertension. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli and Klebsiella species, and her C. difficile colitis is being managed with vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to aspiration pneumonitis, which can lead to further lung complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The presence of subsegmental PE increases the risk of developing further embolic events or complications related to pulmonary hypertension.
3. C. difficile Colitis: The patient has an ongoing infection with C. difficile, which can lead to severe colitis and may require surgical intervention if not properly managed.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The UTI caused by E. coli and Klebsiella species may progress to a kidney infection or sepsis if"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 10607**] is a 60 yo F with CAD s/p IMI, CHF s/p
   AICD, SLE, scleroderma, severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home O2, C.
   difficle colitis, recent admission for R hip fracture s/p ORIF
   complicated by urosepsis and respiratory failure who was discharged to
   rehab yesterday and returns for respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  Currently at baseline O2 requirements.  Likely
   aspiration event in the setting of pulmonary HTN and COPD.  She was
   also noted to have nodular consolidation and fluid in trachea and
   esophagus susp for aspiration pneumonitis.  Patient has severe
   pulmonary hypertension on sildenafil and bosenten.  CXR suggests mild
   pulmonary edema, likely worsened by tachycardia (driven by fever,
   pain).  CTA chest showed singular small PE at LLL ant basal segment
   branch point, left pleural effusion, & bibasal atelectasis.  I do not
   see a significant pulmonary infiltrate.
   - O2 by NC with goal O2 sat of 88-94%.
   - cont. pulmonary HTN treatment with sildenafil and viagra
   - rate control adequately with metoprolol
   - Lasix IV for goal -1L today
   - daily weights
   - repeat ECHO
   - lovenox at treatment doses
   - aspiration percautions
   # Fever:  In last 24 hours prior to discharge, Tmax was 99.6.  In last
   48 hours prior to discharge, Tmax was 102.1 on [**10-14**].  Leukocytosis
   stable from discharge.  She does does have c. diff and was found to
   have pan-sensitive Klebsiella/E. colic UTI on appropriate abx since
   [**10-9**].  Neg. U/A.  Repeat UCx pending.  She is intermittently tachypneic
   to 40s, but CT chest showed no sig. infiltrate.  [**Month (only) 51**] be from
   asipration.  Per Ortho, R hip does not appear infected.  There is
   erythema just around the incision over her R hip.  PICC line was placed
   yesterday and site appears benign.  Other considerations include drug
   fever.  She also has a PE but appears small.
   - monitor fever curve (note on standing tylenol for pain)
   - sputum culture
   - follow up urine, blood cultures (OSH # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10809**])
   - cont po vanc for C. diff
   - vanc/cefepime pending 48 hours of negative culture data
   - US RUE to r/o thrombosis (on anticoagulation anyway)
   # C. difficle colitis:  No evidence of megacolon.
   - serial abd exams
   - plan for prolonged PO vanco course for 2 weeks after last dose of abx
   THEN taper 125mg PO QID X 14 days, 125mg PO BID X 1, 125mg daily x 1
   week, 125mg QOD x 1 week, 125mg q3 days x 2 weeks.
   # MAT vs afib:  BP stable but HR suboptimally controlled.  Worsened by
   fever, PE, post-op pain.  In addition, at rehab she was only given 50
   metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**].
   - cont. metoprolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 7**] to improve filling time
   - control pain with standing tylenol, limit narcotics
   # Elevated troponin:  Likely demand ischemia.  No sig. ischemic EKG
   changes.
   - trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - cont. ASA 81 mg (cannot tolerate higher doses), BB, statin
   - on lovenox for PE
   # Pulmonary HTN c/b R heart failure:  BNP [**Numeric Identifier 10810**].
   -gentle diuresis prn to decrease burden on RV
   -outpt regimen sildenafil, bosentan
   # R Hip Fracture: s/p R ORIF on [**2167-10-8**].
   - lovenox for anticoagulation
   - pain control with standing tylenol, oxycodone prn, and lidocaine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD) post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left circumflex artery (LCx), congestive heart failure (CHF) post artificial cardiac defibrillator (AICD) implantation, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, severe pulmonary hypertension (PHN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen therapy, Clostridium difficile colitis (C. diff), and a recent admission for right hip fracture with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF).

The patient presents with respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonitis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). The PE is confirmed by a CT angiography (CTA) showing a single small PE at the left lower lobe apical segmental branch point, along with left pleural effusion and bibasal atelectasis. The patient's fever is likely due to a combination of factors including C. diff infection, possible drug fever, and underlying systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The chest X-ray suggests mild pulmonary edema, but there is no significant infiltrate seen on the CT chest. The echocardiogram (ECHO) shows severe pulmonary hypertension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe pulmonary hypertension, COPD, C. difficile colitis, and previous admissions for respiratory distress and a right hip fracture. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress in the setting of aspiration pneumonitis. The patient has a background of poor substrate and may have a subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE), but the chronicity and contribution to her clinical status are unclear. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, therapeutic anticoagulation, diuretics, and treatment for pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to aspiration pneumonitis. This can lead to hypoxia and respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a subsegmental PE, which can cause further respiratory distress and potentially lead to a massive PE if not treated appropriately.
3. C. difficile Colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which can worsen with antibiotic use and may lead to severe abdominal symptoms and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and any further stress on the heart, such as respiratory distress or PE, can lead to myocardial ischemia and infarction.
5. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She also has severe pulmonary hypertension, COPD, and is on home oxygen. The patient has had recent admissions for right hip fracture surgery complicated by urosepsis and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. She was readmitted for respiratory distress in the setting of aspiration pneumonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is currently at baseline oxygenation, but there is a risk of further decompensation due to aspiration pneumonitis. Oxygen therapy and aspiration precautions are recommended.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, and free water boluses are advised to correct this.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and Klebsiella species. Antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin is recommended.
4. Clostridium difficile Colitis: The patient has C. difficile colitis, and treatment with vancomycin is planned.
5. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains suboptimally controlled, and metoprolol therapy should be continued to achieve a target heart rate of 65-70 bpm.
6. Elevated Troponin: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which are trending down and are most likely"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 60F with CAD s/p IMI & PCI [**2164**], severe pulmonary
   HTN c/b R heart failure, COPD on home O2, C. difficile colitis, recent
   admission for R hip fracture s/p ORIF complicated by urosepsis and
   respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation readmitted for
   respiratory distress in the setting of aspiration pneumonitis.
   #Respiratory distress:  Presently at baseline oxygenation;
   decompensation most attributable to aspiration pneumonitis in a
   background of poor substrate; not clearly a superimposed bacterial
   pneumonia; CTA chest showed subsegmental PE but unclear chronicity and
   degree of contribution to current clinical status
   - O2 by NC/FT with goal sat of >88-90% (on 2L at baseline)
   - cont broad-spectrum abx pending negative blood cx from rehab
   - therapeutic anticoagulation with lovenox
   - bolus diuresis for goal -500 cc  today
   - cont. pulmonary HTN treatment with sildenafil and viagra
   - implement speech/swallow recs (OMR [**10-15**])
   - aspiration precautions
   #UTI
 [**10-9**] urine Cx with pan-[**Last Name (un) 270**] E. Coli/Klebsiella, plan to continue
   cipro through [**10-19**] (7 day course)
   -cefepime on board for HCAP cov
g, as above
 will cover these
   organisms
   #C. dificile colitis:  Abd benign w/o evidence of megacolon on CT
   -cont po vancomycin (125 QID through [**11-2**], followed by 125 mg daily x 1
   week, then 125 mg every other day x 1 week, then 125 mg every 3 days
   for 2 weeks, presuming no prolongation of other ABX course)
   -serial abd exams
   #MAT vs afib:  HR remains suboptimally controlled, tachycardia likely
   exacerbated by adrenergic surge in the setting of aspiration +/- PE
   and/or infection
   - cont. metoprolol, uptitrate to achieve goal HR 65-70 to optimize
   filling time (although ideally would leave BP room for diuresis)
   - diuresis, as above
   #Elevated troponin
 trending down; most attributable to
   subendocardial/demand ischemia in the setting of aforementioned events
   given that CKMB WNL, however does notably have h/o CAD s/p PCI
   - ASA 81 mg (cannot tolerate higher doses per OMR), BB, statin
   - systemic anticoagulation with lovenox for PE
   # Pulmonary HTN c/b R heart failure
   -gentle diuresis prn to decrease burden on RV
   -outpt regimen sildenafil, bosentan
   # R Hip Fracture: s/p R ORIF on [**2167-10-8**]
   - lovenox for anticoagulation
   - pain control with standing tylenol, oxycodone prn, and lidocaine

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), COPD, C. difficile colitis, recent admission for a right hip fracture surgery with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently admitted for respiratory distress, which is believed to be caused by aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of poor nutritional status. The patient also has a history of urosepsis and has been readmitted for respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C (97.3Â°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on face tent. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels of 0.08 ng/mL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels of 415 IU/L. Other lab results indicate hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation above 88-90%.
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics pending negative blood culture results.
3. Therapeutic anticoagulation with"
