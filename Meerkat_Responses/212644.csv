   # Sublingual and Neck Swelling
 Pt remains intubated for airway
   protection. + Neck and soft tissue swelling per CT neck. Etiology
   remains unclear however was in the setting of supra-therapeutic INR and
   clinical hx of dysphagia prior to the respiratory distress.
   Differential Diagnoses includes hematoma vs angioedema vs abcess.
   -          ENT to follow-up this afternoon, will discuss with ENT
   regarding laryngoscope and/or further imaging modalities
   -          Will also speak with radiology regarding optimal imaging
   studies in the setting of intubation

   # Fever: Pt spiked to 100.8 overnight. BCx and Ucx pending. L lung
   fields appear slightly more opacified vs yesterday. Switched from
   Clindamycin to Unasyn overnight to cover for potential nasopharyngeal
   flora infection. Increase in WBC overnight from 8K to 11K in setting of
   steroids. AVSS otherwise.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and carotid stenting who was admitted with sublingual bleed and respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated due to difficult intubation and has a sublingual hematoma. The cause of respiratory distress is unclear, with possible etiologies including hematoma, allergic reaction, or infection. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, steroids, and antihistamines. Coagulopathy is being corrected with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a possible infectious etiology. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or worsening respiratory status, is important.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a sublingual hematoma and elevated INR. Caution should be taken to avoid further bleeding complications, especially if anticoagulants are restarted.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and the current atrial fibrillation episode may increase the risk of arrhythmias. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and consideration of antiarrhythmic medications may be required.
5. Thromboembolic events: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with upper airway obstruction, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of subacute airway obstruction and respiratory failure. There is concern for possible angioedema or hematoma causing extrinsic compression of the upper airway. The patient's INR is elevated, which raises concerns about a potential hematoma. The patient has been identified as being allergic to shellfish, medication, environmental factors, and viral agents. The elevated INR appears to be related to an unknown etiology, but the patient responded to vitamin K alone. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with good rate control, and their blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient has a low-grade fever, which may be due to an ENT soft tissue infection or dental infection. Antibiotics have been administered empirically, and further imaging is needed to rule out a dental abscess. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed appropriately in the ICU. Prophylactic measures include anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and carotid stenting. He was admitted with sublingual bleed and respiratory distress.
- The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to sublingual and neck swelling. The swelling has improved since yesterday, but the etiology is still unclear. Differential diagnoses include hematoma, angioedema, and less likely abscess.
- The patient has a fever and is being treated empirically with Unasyn for potential pneumonia. Lung fields show improved opacities on the left side and questionable increased markings on the right inferiorly.
- The patient's INR was initially supratherapeutic and now is subtherapeutic. Ecchymoses are improving, and Coumadin is being held. Daily coagulation studies will be continued.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is not adequately rate-controlled on the current regimen. The patient's cardiologist is managing this issue, and the patient will transition back to home doses once an oral gastrointestinal (OG) tube is placed.
- The patient has peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is being held on certain medications due to the bleed. These medications will be restarted once the OG tube is placed.
- The patient is currently nothing by mouth (NPO) and"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory distress. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation since admission. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation.

The patient received a 500cc normal saline bolus due to a low blood pressure in the 80s-90s, which improved to the 100s. The underlying cause of his condition remains unclear, despite reviewing studies with a neuroradiologist. No further imaging is recommended, and the insertion of a nasogastric or orogastric tube is avoided as the patient is likely to be extubated soon.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were clindamycin, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam.

The patient is currently receiving fentanyl infusion for pain management and metoprolol, famotidine, and other medications as part of his ICU care.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's maximum temperature recorded over the past 24 hours was 37.6 degrees Celsius. His current weight is 84.6 kg, compared to 82.6 kg on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and carotid stenting who was admitted for sublingual bleed and respiratory distress. He remains intubated for airway protection due to neck and soft tissue swelling seen on CT neck. The etiology of the sublingual and neck swelling is unclear, but it could be a hematoma, angioedema, or abscess. The patient has an elevated temperature, slightly more opacified lung fields on chest X-ray, and an increased white blood cell count. He has multiple ecchymoses on his extremities, which occurred following intubation in the emergency department. The patient's INR is currently subtherapeutic, and he is not receiving anticoagulation therapy. His chronic atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with IV metoprolol. He has a history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is not currently receiving nutrition. The patient is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway compromise due to sublingual and neck swelling.
2. Infection (possible pneumonia indicated by opacified lung fields and elevated temperature).
3. Thromboembolic events (due to immobilization and potential hypercoagulable state).
4. Bleeding complications (given the history of sublingual bleed and"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure attributed to upper airway obstruction. There are potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions. 

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. VAP is a common complication in critically ill patients in the ICU.
   - Barotrauma: High pressures during mechanical ventilation can cause injury to the lungs, leading to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
   - Ventricular arrhythmias: Respiratory failure and underlying cardiac conditions may predispose the patient to ventricular arrhythmias.

2. Coagulation Complications:
   - Bleeding: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a higher risk of bleeding. Any invasive procedures or trauma could lead to significant bleeding.

3. Infection:
   - The patient has been receiving antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.

4. Fluid Balance:
   - The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored due to the risk of fluid overload or dehydration. Maintaining euvolemia is crucial for proper organ perfusion.

5. Nutritional Support:
   - The patient requires nutritional support, as indicated by the placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube and initiation of tube feeding (TF). Malnutrition can delay recovery and increase the risk of complications.

6. Cardiovascular"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they have been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/78 mmHg to 91/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on fentanyl infusion for pain management and receiving various ICU medications.

The physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished without acute distress or signs of overweight/obesity, thinness, anxiety, or diaphoresis. There are no abnormalities noted in the eyes, head/ears/nose/throat, lymphatic system, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory/chest, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal system, or skin. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The blood glucose levels are within normal range, while the creatinine (Cr) and TCO2 levels are slightly elevated. The PT/PTT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and carotid stenting who was admitted with sublingual bleed and respiratory distress. He remains intubated for airway protection. His neck swelling has improved since yesterday, but the etiology remains unclear. Possible diagnoses include hematoma, angioedema, or less likely abscess. The patient tolerated extubation well. He will continue to receive Decadron, Benadyl, and an H2 blocker until the afternoon. 

The patient had a fever in the past 24 hours, but is now afebrile. His WBC count is within normal range. He will be transitioned to Augmentin PO for a 4-5 day course empirically. 

The patient's INR was previously supratherapeutic but is now subtherapeutic. The cause of the elevated INR remains unclear. He will hold Coumadin and have daily coags. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was not adequately rate-controlled on the current regimen. He will be transitioned to a PO regimen once extubated. 

The patient is holding ASA due to bleeding. His hypertension medications, including verapamil, atenolol, and lisinopril, are currently held, but will be restarted at home. 

The patient has hyperlipidemia and will continue on a statin. He is NPO"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics and sedatives. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient is being ventilated with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. There are also abnormalities in kidney function and electrolyte levels. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to the critical illness and the use of corticosteroids.
4. Medication complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics and sedatives, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and carotid stenting who was admitted with sublingual bleed and respiratory distress. He remains intubated for airway protection due to sublingual and neck swelling, which has improved since yesterday. The etiology of the swelling is unclear, and differential diagnoses include hematoma, angioedema, and less likely abscess. ENT follow-up and scope are planned today. The patient's fever is likely due to aspiration pneumonia, and he will continue on a 5-day course of Unasyn empirically. His supratherapeutic INR has improved to subtherapeutic levels, and ecchymoses are improving. Coumadin is being held, and daily coagulation studies will be performed. The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is not adequately rate-controlled on current medication regimen while in the hospital. He received metoprolol 5mg three times this morning and diltiazem 10mg twice today. Once an oral gastrointestinal tube is placed, the patient will transition back to home doses of medications, restarting daily doses in the afternoon and full dose in the morning. Verapamil, atenolol, and lisinopril are currently held, but will be restarted once the OG tube is placed. The patient has peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is nil per os (NPO) for now. He will start nutrition once the OG tube is placed. Pneumoboots have been applied, and the patient has two peripheral intravenous lines. His code status is full code, and he will be dispositioned to the ICU while intubated."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and L carotid stenting. He was admitted with sublingual bleed and respiratory distress. The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to sublingual and neck swelling. The swelling has improved since yesterday, but the etiology is unclear. Differential diagnoses include hematoma, angioedema, and abscess.

The patient has been febrile for the past 24 hours, with no identified source of infection. Lung fields show improved mild opacities on the left and questionable increased lung markings on the right inferiorly. The white blood cell count is stable at 11K despite steroid use.

The patient's INR has been supratherapeutic in the past but is now subtherapeutic. Ecchymoses are improving. Coumadin is being held, and daily coagulation studies will be performed.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is not adequately rate-controlled on the current regimen. He will be transitioned back to home doses once an orogastric tube is placed.

The patient has peripheral vascular disease and hypertension, both of which are being held in the setting of bleeding. He also has hyperlipidemia and will continue statin therapy.

The patient is NPO and will start nutrition once an orogastric tube is placed. Pneumoboots have been placed for pneumonia prevention"

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation and carotid stenting, admitted with sublingual bleed and respiratory distress. The patient remains intubated for airway protection due to neck swelling, although the swelling has improved since yesterday. The etiology of the swelling is still unclear. 

The patient's temperature is elevated, with a maximum of 37.7°C (99.8°F) and currently at 37.4°C (99.4°F). Heart rate is 115 bpm, blood pressure is 135/73 mmHg, respiratory rate is 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's weight is currently 84.2 kg. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,537 mL and output of 1,193 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,344 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and ventilator settings including tidal volume (VT) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, and calcium are also within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   Upper airway obstruction (neck swelling, hematoma)
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated primarily for upper airway
   obstruction.  Obstruction resolving.  Cuff leak present consistently
   for past 2 days.  Plan to move to extubation trial (with anesthesiology
   in  presence and use of Cook catheter).
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- subungual hematoma and edemna (possible
   related to allergic reaction)
   A-FIB -- continue to use iv beta-blocker.  Hope to resume usual PO
   meds.  Hold anti-coagulation
   NUTIRTIONAL SUPPORT
 hope to initate PO once extubated.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 55 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. They are experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and have a history of upper airway obstruction, which has resolved but with the presence of a cuff leak. The patient also has subungual hematoma and edema, possibly related to an allergic reaction. Other medical conditions include no known drug allergies, normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there is a slightly elevated blood glucose level. The patient is currently receiving nutritional support through intravenous fluids and will hopefully initiate oral intake once extubated. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVTs. Prophylactic measures such as the use of compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent this complication.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can lead to the development of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (P"

   Assessment and Plan
   Upper airway obstruction (neck swelling, hematoma)
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated primarily for upper airway
   obstruction.  Obstruction resolving.  Cuff leak present consistently
   for past 2 days.  Plan to move to extubation trial (with anesthesiology
   in  presence and use of Cook catheter).
   UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION -- subungual hematoma and edemna (possible
   related to allergic reaction)
   A-FIB -- continue to use iv beta-blocker.  Hope to resume usual PO
   meds.
