   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11039**] is a 77 y.o. Male w/ h.o. diastolic dysfunction, A.
   fib/flutter s/p recent PVI, COPD, asthma, ?IPF, HTN, initially
   presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] w/ [**1-8**] week h.o of lower extremity edema,
   shortness of breath. Intubated for hypercapneic respiratory distress.
   Transferred for further hypoxic work-up whether this is COPD
   exacerbation, PNA, CHF exacerbation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT [**Month/Day (2) **]/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Pt has had underlying hypoxia of unknown etiology over the past month
   with a requirement of 5L O2 particularly during activity. Pt noted to
   be hypoxic at outside hospital eventually requiring intubation.
   Etiology of hypoxic respiratory failure includes possible infection,
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD, IPF exacerbation. Given recent Echo
   performed at [**Hospital3 **] and clinical history, have low suspicion
   that this is Cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Infection needs to also be
   considered particularly [**Hospital3 609**], PCP given his extended exposure to
   steroids. Have low suspicion for bacterial given the negative sputum
   cx. Pt had Vancomycin prior to transfer, given his renal function his
   next dose would not be for 48 hours. IPF exacerbation needs to also be
   considered given the rapidity of decline as well as his ?h.o. IPF. Pt's
   plateau pressures are also concerning given their level of upper 30s,
   suggest poorly compliant lungs. Suspect [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue on 4-6cc/kg
   for volume control, will also place esophageal balloon to determine
   transpleural pressures to determine whether alveolar pressures are
   appropriately high.
   - f/u BAL cx (pending), gram stain (-), PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 609**] culture, acid fast,
   CMV all pending
   - continue on Methylprednisolone
   - looks clinically volume overloaded, unsure what role it is playing in
   his overall picture but would consider talking to renal about  CVVH if
   we want to diurese.
   - Sedate for synchrony, may have to paralyze, abdominal girth increased
   throughout the night, decreased with NG suction (which didn
t pull out
   very much liquid.)
   - set target volume at 400cc/hr x 26 bpm
   - place esophageal balloon to determine transpleural pressures
   - Chest CT?
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   On admission pt noted to have a Creatinine of 1.8 which trended up to
   3.0 in the setting of diuresis. During hospitalization at OSH it was
   unclear as to whether pt is fluid overloaded given his hypoxia and
   increasing lower extremity edema versus hypovolemic given the poor
   response in urine output to furosemide. On examination today pt appears
   dry with poor urine output will hold off on diuresis for the time
   bring.
   - Urine lytes are consistent with intrinsic renal faillure
   - Urine output dwindling
   - Consult renal  re: CVVH
   .
Acute on  chronic ANEMIA,
   Patient came in with a supratherapeutic INR, and had three procedures,
   a central line, and a-line, and a removal of a femoral triple lumen in
   his artery.  While he had some slightly greater than expected bleeding
   with the first two procedures, he had profound and difficult to control
   bleeding.  This combined with some hemoconcentration on admission as by
   history he was diuresed agressively at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] likely explain his
   acute drop from 25->19.  For his elevated INR/bleeding he received 5
   total units of FFP, and is in the process of receiving two units.  He
   has developed a large hematoma in his right thigh, and if his hct
   continues to drop or remains persistently transfusion non-responsive, I
   would have a low threshold for imaging to looking for arterial injury
   from the triple lumen.
   Xfusion goal>21
   Q4 HCT, Q8 coags
   FFP and vitamin K if INR>3.0
   .
   Chronic Anemia:
   Pt has history of chronic anemia and received 2u of PRBC at OSH. Per
   report pt underwent blding work up including consultation with surgery
   and GI for possible RP bleed given the recent PVI versus GI bld. Pt was
   NG lavage negative, guaiac negative, CT abd/pelvis was also negative
   for RP bld. Pt Hct has remained stable.
   - continue to trend Hct daily
   - will keep active type and cross
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   Pt recently underwent PVI for new onset A. flutter, currently in sinus
   rhythm. INR was noted to be supratherapeutic, currently being reversed
   given central line placement, A-line removal. Will change SR diltiazem
   to QID diltiazem.
   - divide 180mg SR Diltiazem into Diltiazem 45mg QID
   - reverse INR for procedures
   - consider restarting Coumadin after lines are placed
   .
 DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LIPID DISORDER)

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation/flutter post percutaneous pulmonary valve insertion (PVI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, possible interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and was intubated for hypercapnic respiratory distress. He was transferred for further evaluation of hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be due to exacerbation of COPD, pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), or IPF.

The patient's current condition is complicated by respiratory failure, acute renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, atrial flutter, and dyslipidemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 31 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and plateau pressure of 33 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.20, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 75 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 122.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct)"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT [**Year (4 digits) **]/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Pt has had underlying hypoxia of unknown etiology over the past month
   with a requirement of 5L O2 particularly during activity. Pt noted to
   be hypoxic at outside hospital eventually requiring intubation.
   Etiology of hypoxic respiratory failure includes possible infection,
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD, IPF exacerbation. Given recent Echo
   performed at [**Hospital3 **] and clinical history, have low suspicion
   that this is Cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Infection needs to also be
   considered particularly fungal, PCP given his extended exposure to
   steroids. Have low suspicion for bacterial given the negative sputum
   cx. Pt had Vancomycin prior to transfer, given his renal function his
   next dose would not be for 48 hours. IPF exacerbation needs to also be
   considered given the rapidity of decline as well as his ?h.o. IPF. Pt's
   plateau pressures are also concerning given their level of upper 30s,
   suggest poorly compliant lungs. Suspect [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue on 4-6cc/kg
   for volume control, will also place esophageal balloon to determine
   transpleural pressures to determine whether alveolar pressures are
   appropriately high.
   - Bronchoscopy today w/ BAL
   - f/u BAL cx, gram stain
   - will start on PCP treatment of Bactrim
   - continue on Methylprednisolone
   - hold diuresis for now
   - wean sedation
   - set target volume at 400cc/hr x 26 bpm
   - place esophageal balloon to determine transpleural pressures
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   On admission pt noted to have a Creatinine of 1.8 which trended up to
   3.0 in the setting of diuresis. During hospitalization at OSH it was
   unclear as to whether pt is fluid overloaded given his hypoxia and
   increasing lower extremity edema versus hypovolemic given the poor
   response in urine output to furosemide. On examination today pt appears
   dry with poor urine output will hold off on diuresis for the time
   bring.
   - check urine lytes
   - monitor urine output
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   Pt recently underwent PVI for new onset A. flutter, currently in sinus
   rhythm. INR was noted to be supratherapeutic, currently being reversed
   given central line placement, A-line removal. Will change SR diltiazem
   to QID diltiazem.
   - divide 180mg SR Diltiazem into Diltiazem 45mg QID
   - reverse INR for procedures
   - consider restarting Coumadin after lines are placed

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia of unknown etiology for the past month and required intubation at an outside hospital. Etiologies of respiratory failure include possible infection, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD, and IPF exacerbation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a volume control strategy and is being treated for suspected PCP pneumonia. There is concern about the patient's renal function, which has shown an increasing creatinine level from 1.8 to 3.0. The patient also has atrial flutter, which was recently converted to sinus rhythm after percutaneous balloon visualization. An arterial femoral line was placed at the outside hospital but appears to be in an artery rather than a vein. The patient has a history of chronic anemia and received 2 units of packed red blood cells. Other issues include dyslipidemia and chronic anemia. The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support, repletion of electrolytes as needed, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending resolution of symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying hypoxia and requirement of mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Renal failure:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11039**] is a 77 y.o. Male w/ h.o. diastolic dysfunction, A.
   fib/flutter s/p recent PVI, COPD, asthma, ?IPF, HTN, initially
   presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] w/ [**1-8**] week h.o of lower extremity edema,
   shortness of breath. Intubated for hypercapneic respiratory distress.
   Transferred for further hypoxic work-up whether this is COPD
   exacerbation, PNA, CHF exacerbation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT [**Month/Day (2) **]/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Pt has had underlying hypoxia of unknown etiology over the past month
   with a requirement of 5L O2 particularly during activity. Pt noted to
   be hypoxic at outside hospital eventually requiring intubation.
   Etiology of hypoxic respiratory failure includes possible infection,
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD, IPF exacerbation. Given recent Echo
   performed at [**Hospital3 **] and clinical history, have low suspicion
   that this is Cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Infection needs to also be
   considered particularly [**Hospital3 609**], PCP given his extended exposure to
   steroids. Have low suspicion for bacterial given the negative sputum
   cx. Pt had Vancomycin prior to transfer, given his renal function his
   next dose would not be for 48 hours. IPF exacerbation needs to also be
   considered given the rapidity of decline as well as his ?h.o. IPF. Pt's
   plateau pressures are also concerning given their level of upper 30s,
   suggest poorly compliant lungs. Suspect [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] continue on 4-6cc/kg
   for volume control, will also place esophageal balloon to determine
   transpleural pressures to determine whether alveolar pressures are
   appropriately high.
   - f/u BAL cx (pending), gram stain (-), PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 609**] culture, acid fast,
   CMV all pending
   - continue on Methylprednisolone
   - looks clinically volume overloaded, unsure what role it is playing in
   his overall picture but would consider talking to renal about  CVVH if
   we want to diurese.
   - Sedate for synchrony
   - set target volume at 400cc/hr x 26 bpm
   - place esophageal balloon to determine transpleural pressures
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   On admission pt noted to have a Creatinine of 1.8 which trended up to
   3.0 in the setting of diuresis. During hospitalization at OSH it was
   unclear as to whether pt is fluid overloaded given his hypoxia and
   increasing lower extremity edema versus hypovolemic given the poor
   response in urine output to furosemide. On examination today pt appears
   dry with poor urine output will hold off on diuresis for the time
   bring.
   - check urine lytes
   - monitor urine output
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   Pt recently underwent PVI for new onset A. flutter, currently in sinus
   rhythm. INR was noted to be supratherapeutic, currently being reversed
   given central line placement, A-line removal. Will change SR diltiazem
   to QID diltiazem.
   - divide 180mg SR Diltiazem into Diltiazem 45mg QID
   - reverse INR for procedures
   - consider restarting Coumadin after lines are placed
 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Arterial Femoral Line
   Placed at OSH prior to transfer. Appears to be placed in artery as
   opposed to vein given blood gas draw from line and wave form when
   transduced. Pt has elevated INR of 3.3, will recheck coags after 3u
   FFP, if <1.5 will d/c A-line
   - as mentioned above will give 3u FFP
   - recheck coags
   - if <1.5 will d/c Fem line w/ pressure
   - will replace A-line for ABGs
 DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LIPID DISORDER)
   Continue on home regimen of Simvastatin
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Pt has history of chronic anemia and received 2u of PRBC at OSH. Per
   report pt underwent blding work up including consultation with surgery
   and GI for possible RP bleed given the recent PVI versus GI bld. Pt was
   NG lavage negative, guaiac negative, CT abd/pelvis was also negative
   for RP bld. Pt Hct has remained stable.
   - continue to trend Hct daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation/flutter after percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, possible interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypertension, and others. The patient presented to the hospital with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and was intubated for hypercapneic respiratory distress. He was transferred for further evaluation of hypoxic respiratory failure, which could be caused by possible infection, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD exacerbation, or IPF exacerbation.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial flutter, and other medical problems. The respiratory failure is suspected to be non-cardiogenic given the low suspicion of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and the need to consider infection and IPF exacerbation. The patient's plateau pressures are concerning, indicating poorly compliant lungs. The plan is to continue on volume control with 4-6cc/kg tidal volume, place an esophageal balloon to determine transpleural pressures, and perform a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture.

The acute renal failure is characterized by an increase in creatinine from 1.8 to 3.0 during diuresis. The patient appears dry with poor urine output, so diuresis will be held off for now. The atrial"

Acute on  chronic ANEMIA,
   Patient came in with a supratherapeutic INR, and had three procedures,
   a central line, and a-line, and a removal of a femoral triple lumen in
   his artery.  While he had some slightly greater than expected bleeding
   with the first two procedures, he had profound and difficult to control
   bleeding.  This combined with some hemoconcentration on admission as by
   history he was diuresed agressively at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] likely explain his
   acute drop from 25->19.  For his elevated INR/bleeding he received 5
   total units of FFP, and is in the process of receiving two units.  He
   has developed a large hematoma in his right thigh, and if his hct
   continues to drop or remains persistently transfusion non-responsive, I
   would have a low threshold for imaging to looking for arterial injury

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11039**] is a 77 y.o. Male w/ h.o. diastolic dysfunction, A.
   fib/flutter s/p recent PVI, COPD, asthma, ?IPF, HTN, initially
   presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] w/ [**1-8**] week h.o of lower extremity edema,
   shortness of breath. Intubated for hypercapneic respiratory distress.
   Transferred for further hypoxic work-up whether this is COPD
   exacerbation, PNA, CHF exacerbation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Pt has had underlying hypoxia of unknown etiology over the past month
   with a requirement of 5L O2 particularly during activity. Pt noted to
   be hypoxic at outside hospital eventually requiring intubation.
   Etiology of hypoxic respiratory failure likely multifactorial including
   possible infection, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD, IPF
   exacerbation. Pt does appear volume overloaded, and fluid is likely one
   component of lung process. There is no evidence for infection on sputum
   or bronch samples, however cannot rule out infectious component. IPF
   exacerbation needs to also be considered given the rapidity of decline.
   Pt's plateau pressures are also concerning given their level of upper
   30s, suggest poorly compliant lungs.
   - Has ARDS-like picture, will continue on 4-6cc/kg for volume control,
   PEEP 16
   - unable to obtain good recordings from esophageal balloon so D/Ced
   - f/u BAL cx and CMV cx, other studies negative, however patient has
   leukocytosis and will continue empiric HAP tx for now D2
   - cont vanc/cefepime and monitor vanco trough while on CVVH
   - continue on Methylprednisolone for possible IPF exacerbation
   - diuresis with CVVH
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   On admission pt noted to have a Creatinine of 1.8 which trended up to
   3.0 in the setting of diuresis. Likely ischemic ATN. Patient anuric
   with worsening Cr, K, Ca-phos product yesterday, initiated on CVVH. Had
   precipitious drop in Ca, thought to be [**2-8**] citrate toxicity but unclear
   since total Ca was also low. Held citrate but line clotted off despite
   higher flows, will restart citrate and change machine.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - CVVH goal as negative as tolerated
   .
Acute on  chronic ANEMIA,
   Patient came in with a supratherapeutic INR, and had three procedures,
   a central line, and a-line, and a removal of a femoral triple lumen in
   his artery.  While he had some slightly greater than expected bleeding
   with the first two procedures, he had profound and difficult to control
   bleeding.  This combined with some hemoconcentration on admission as by
   history he was diuresed agressively at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] likely explain his
   acute drop from 25->19.  Hct now stable x 24 hours. CT done to assess
   right thigh and no bleed.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks, Xfusion goal>21
   .
   Chronic Anemia:
   Pt has history of chronic anemia and received 2u of PRBC at OSH. Per
   report pt underwent blding work up including consultation with surgery
   and GI for possible RP bleed given the recent PVI versus GI bld. Pt was
   NG lavage negative, guaiac negative, CT abd/pelvis was also negative
   for RP bld. Pt Hct has remained stable.
   - continue to trend Hct
   - will keep active type and cross
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF: TTE showed moderate diastolic dysfunction and signs
   of right heart strain and pulmonary HTN, likely due to interstitial
   fibrosis.
   - cont diuresis with CVVH
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   Pt recently underwent PVI for new onset A. flutter, currently in sinus
   rhythm. INR was noted to be supratherapeutic, currently being reversed
   given central line placement, A-line removal. Will change SR diltiazem
   to QID diltiazem.
   - can hold dilt as needed to allow more room for diuresis
   - holding  Coumadin

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 11039**] and reviewed the historical, lab, and
   imaging data. I was present for the key portion of the services
   provided and I agree with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 659**]
s note above, including her findings
   and plan of care.  I have also met with the [**Known lastname 11039**] family and explained
   my assessment of his pulmonary condition and prognosis.
   Mr [**Known lastname 11039**] has diffuse dense pulmonary opacities in the setting of
   severe COPD and IPF with chronic severe hypoxemia.  Though he has
   diastolic CHF,  this doesn
t seem to be CHF clinically.  It could be a
   flare of IPF thought it is not responding to high dose steroids. We
   doubt it
s an infection as he
s on antibiotics without improvement and
   BAL has shown no pathogen.  He is at the limits of mechanical
   ventilation with very stiff lungs even on low VT ventilation, and
   despite a MV of 11 L/min his dead space is so bad that his PC02 is over
   100 and pH is only 7.05.  I believe his lungs are irretrievably damaged
   and that the chance of his attaining ventilator independence is very
   low
 lower still his chance of ever going home and still lower still
   of having a reasonable respiratory quality of life at home.  The
   patient
s wife (a nurse) and family seem ready to move to comfort
   measures.  We will work with respiratory therapy to see how this can be
   best  and most sensitively carried out.
   60 min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diastolic dysfunction, atrial flutter post pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, possible interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypertension, and anemia. He presented to the hospital with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and was intubated for hypercapnic respiratory distress. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, likely multifactorial including possible infection, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD exacerbation, and IPF exacerbation.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, high-dose steroids for possible IPF exacerbation, and diuresis with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). He also has acute renal failure, which is likely ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and has required CVVH due to anuria and worsening creatinine levels.

Additionally, the patient has a history of chronic anemia, and his hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has remained stable. He underwent a blood transfusion at the outside hospital and had a bleeding workup, including consultation with surgery and gastroenterology for possible retroperitoneal bleed given recent PVI versus gastrointestinal bleed. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was negative for retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's atrial flutter was"

   edema only. There is no evidence for infection on sputum or bronch
   samples, however cannot rule out infectious component. IPF exacerbation
   needs to also be considered given the rapidity of decline as well as
   his ?h.o. IPF. Pt's plateau pressures are also concerning given their

Acute on  chronic ANEMIA,
   Patient came in with a supratherapeutic INR, and had three procedures,
   a central line, and a-line, and a removal of a femoral triple lumen in
   his artery.  While he had some slightly greater than expected bleeding
   with the first two procedures, he had profound and difficult to control
   bleeding.  This combined with some hemoconcentration on admission as by
   history he was diuresed agressively at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] likely explain his

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diastolic dysfunction, atrial flutter post pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, possible interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypertension (HTN), and hypercapneic respiratory failure. The patient presented with lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and was intubated for hypercapneic respiratory distress. He was transferred for further evaluation of hypoxic work-up, possibly due to COPD exacerbation, pneumonia (PNA), or congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and anemia. The respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including possible infection, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, COPD, and IPF exacerbation. The acute renal failure is indicated by a creatinine level that trended up from 1.8 to 3.0 in the setting of diuresis, and the patient is currently anuric with worsening creatinine, potassium, and calcium-phosphate product. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated.

The patient's chronic anemia is suspected to be due to a bleeding disorder, possibly related to recent procedures or gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent blood workup, including consultation with surgery and GI for possible retroperitoneal bleed,"
