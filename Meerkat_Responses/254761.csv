","Summary:
The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. They were intubated, given CPR, atropine, and epinephrine. An arterial line, invasive ventilation, and trans-thoracic echo were started. The patient has a history of aspirin allergy and anaphylaxis. They are currently on infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/61 to 132/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The flow sheet data shows fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Stress ulcer due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Nosocomial infection from invasive lines or devices.
5. Delirium or cognitive dysfunction due to sedation medications and ICU stay.
6. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing cardiac issues or sepsis.
7. Renal dysfunction indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
8. Electrolyte imbalances indicated by abnormal sodium, potassium,"

","The patient is an elderly Caucasian male who presented with cardiac arrest, received CPR, atropine, and epinephrine, and was intubated. He also received two units of blood. An EKG was performed, and the patient was placed on invasive ventilation. An arterial line was started, and a trans-thoracic echo was conducted. The patient's allergies include aspirin and anaphylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,820 mL and output of 210 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,610 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 61 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26.5 mg/dL, creatinine of 3.3 mg/dL, glucose of 83 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, calcium of 7.8 mg/dL, and magnesium of 2.2 mg/dL. 

Physical examination findings include a pale appearance, dry mucous membranes, supple neck, normal cardiac auscultation, equal bilateral breath sounds without crackles or wheezes, soft abdomen with mild distention and hypoactive bowel sounds, and no visible skin abnormalities. 

The patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and has multiple lines including an arterial line. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being taken. The patient's code status is full code, and there is no mention of disposition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient may include ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections."

   Assessment and Plan

   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers, may rule in
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol in peri-MI setting, increase
   statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- continue IV PPI gtt
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn
   -- consider change to PSV as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35%. Does not appear
   decompensated currently given CXR
   -- given GI bleed, will hold on diuresis (no lasix, aldactone)
   -- care with IVF, blood products
   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in
   setting of cardiac arrest.
   -- volume resuscitation as above
   -- send urine lytes, osms, eo's
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - liekly from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control

   # HTN

   -- IV PPI gtt
   -- no bowel regimen needed given GIB

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly male with a history of extensive cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who presented with lethargy and black stools, indicating a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation measures including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, epinephrine, intubation, and blood transfusion. The patient was diagnosed with a GI bleed and underwent transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin concentration of 30. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to the GI bleed, lactic acidosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also has a history of hip fracture and hypertension (HTN). 

The patient's current condition includes being intubated and mechanically ventilated, with an arterial line in place for continuous monitoring of blood pressure and blood gases. The patient is receiving sedation with fentanyl and midazolam (versed), as well as pantoprazole (protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiac function due to the patient's extensive cardiac history and recent cardiac arrest, further deterioration of renal function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male with extensive cardiac disease, including a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presented with lethargy and black stools, indicating gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He experienced a cardiac arrest and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, epinephrine, intubation, and 2 units of blood transfusion.

The patient is currently in the ICU and requires invasive ventilation and arterial line monitoring. He has a history of chronic renal failure and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and hip fracture.

Assessment and Plan:

1. CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient's extensive cardiac history, including previous CABG, predisposes him to ischemic heart disease. The elevated troponin-T levels indicate myocardial damage, likely due to demand ischemia triggered by GI bleeding. Further evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is recommended. The patient should continue on Plavix and low-dose carvedilol in the peri-MI setting. Coumadin should be held due to the risk of bleeding.

2. GI bleed: The patient is at risk for further GI bleeding. He should be monitored closely, and transfusion should be considered to maintain a hematocrit (Hct"

   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the

","Summary:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 
- The patient presented with lethargy and black stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed).
- The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, epinephrine, and intubation. 
- The patient has been in the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter. 
- The patient's troponin-T levels have been elevated, indicating myocardial injury. 
- The patient has renal failure and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). 
- The patient also has diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and a history of hip fracture. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine levels have been elevated, and there is concern for ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the cardiac arrest and possible pre-renal azotemia from the GI bleed.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF-> depressed
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol (held [**1-15**] brady) in peri-MI
   setting, increase statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed: Follow HCT. Will transfuse, recheck after transfusion
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- continue IV PPI gtt
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn. Most recent ABG this am during
   rounds c/w hypoventilation on MMV and pt had episodes of apnea
   overnight. Pressure support increased from 10 to 15. Will repeat ABG
   once stabilized on these settings to re eval
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   - Increase pressure support to 15
   -- wean sedation as tolerate
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Currently
   CXR not c/w worsening CHF but pt
s respiratory pattern c/w some CHF and
   is overall 2.5L positive this am so likely fluid overloaded and will
   need buffing of respiratory status prior to extubation.
   --  care with IVF, blood products
   -- Will give lasix 40 IV x 1 to assess response, change in resp status
   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol, although held for
   brady)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Stabilized since admission.
   -- volume resuscitation as above
   -- F/U urine lytes, osms, eo's
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider retart tomorrow given recent h/o
   PE. If HCT stable, will restart
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # ? R hand weakness: Will follow. Upon later exam, pt more awake with
   equal strength. Consider imaging if focal neuro findings.
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives execpt BB
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV, R femoral TLC. Will DC R fem line after receives blood products
   if can obtain another PIV
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now. Will start TF if will not extubate today
   -- replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx
   -- IV PPI gtt
   - SC heparin
   -- no bowel regimen needed given GIB
   .
   # Code - Full code confirmed with family, but if pt deteriorates would

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease, including a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), presenting with lethargy and black stools. He was found to have a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest. The patient's EKG demonstrated changes consistent with ischemia, most likely due to demand from the GI bleeding. Troponin-T levels were elevated, indicating myocardial injury, but the MB-index was positive, likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered a myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with a recent ejection fraction (EF) of 35% that has decreased to 20%. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His respiratory pattern is consistent with some congestive heart failure (CHF), and he is overall 2.5 liters positive this morning, suggesting fluid overload. 

The patient also has a history of chronic renal failure (CRF) with baseline creatinine levels of 2.2-2.5 in early [Month]. This is likely prerenal in etiology given the recent GI bleed. There is concern for ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of cardiac arrest. The patient's lactic acid levels were elevated but"

   of ischemic heart failure. Currently echo shows bivent dysfunction and
   he is volume overloaded but hemodynamics stable. Plavix, Statin, try
   low dose lasix, goal 500 to 1000 cc negative
   2.       Hypoxemic Resp Failure: in setting of code and decompensated
   systolic function, - now on [**9-17**]
 try [**4-17**] and assess response esp
   after Lasix
   3.       GI bleed: HCT 26.5 after 4 units- give 2 more units with Lasix
   , good access, IV PPI, Gi aware holding off on scope unless fulminant
   bleeding
   4.       ARF: chronic near baseline but may evolve after arrest, follow

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male who presented to the ICU with a cardiac arrest and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease and was found to have a low ejection fraction on echocardiogram. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been given blood products due to the GI bleed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 141/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac injury, as well as abnormal kidney function. The patient is being treated with medications such as Plavix, a statin, and Lasix for volume overload. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's condition and provide supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac failure: Given the patient's history of ischemic heart disease and low ejection fraction, there is a risk of further cardiac deterioration leading to heart failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress, especially if there are complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's abnormal renal function tests suggest acute kidney injury, which can worsen if not managed properly.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the bleeding has been controlled, there is still a risk of re-"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF-> depressed
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol (held [**1-15**] brady) in peri-MI
   setting, increase statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed: Follow HCT. Will transfuse, recheck after transfusion
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- continue IV PPI gtt
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn. Most recent ABG this am during
   rounds c/w hypoventilation on MMV and pt had episodes of apnea
   overnight. Pressure support increased from 10 to 15. Will repeat ABG
   once stabilized on these settings to re eval
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   - Increase pressure support to 15
   -- wean sedation as tolerate
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Currently
   CXR not c/w worsening CHF but pt
s respiratory pattern c/w some CHF and
   is overall 2.5L positive this am so likely fluid overloaded and will
   need buffing of respiratory status prior to extubation.
   --  care with IVF, blood products
   -- Will give lasix 40 IV x 1 to assess response, change in resp status
   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol, although held for
   brady)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Stabilized since admission.
   -- volume resuscitation as above
   -- F/U urine lytes, osms, eo's
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider retart tomorrow given recent h/o
   PE. If HCT stable, will restart
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # ? R hand weakness: Will follow. Upon later exam, pt more awake with
   equal strength. Consider imaging if focal neuro findings.
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives execpt BB
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV, R femoral TLC. Will DC R fem line after receives blood products
   if can obtain another PIV
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now. Will start TF if will not extubate today
   -- replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of extensive cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, as well as a history of pulmonary embolism. He presented with lethargy and black stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. He subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation. The patient's EKG showed changes consistent with ischemia, and his troponin levels were elevated, indicating myocardial damage. He has also shown signs of respiratory failure and chronic systolic heart failure with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's extensive cardiac history, elevated troponin levels, and EKG changes suggest a possible myocardial infarction.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's black stools indicate significant gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory pattern and ABG results suggest hypoventilation and the need for increased pressure support.
4. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's decreased left ventricular ejection fraction indicates chronic systolic heart failure, which may worsen due to fluid overload.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine levels and recent cardiac arrest raise concerns for acute kidney injury, particularly in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Trop-T was
   elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index
   was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have
   triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.
   Less likely to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO in approximately 1 week to reassess
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia but will d/w GI when can restart given recent
   PE.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy which was confirmed by
   pt
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will continue carvedilol,
   add home lasix, consider adding aldactone if real function remains
   stable/improved
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5units pRBCs. No
   further transfusions needed at this time. HCT stable>30
   -- GI aware
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above, will d/w GI

   # Respiratory Failure: pt extubated, doing well
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam and Cr stable.
   n        will attempt to keep fluid balance even today and will restart

   n        restart home lasix
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Creatinine trending down now. Acute renal failure likely prerenal in
   etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in setting of
   cardiac arrest.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even
   -- restart home lasix
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improved
   .
   #Abdominal pain: Pt has mild abdominal pain on exam. Lactate trending
   down. He has not had BM since admission, likely [**1-15**] constipation.
   Started bowel regimen yesterday. Will continue and consider imaging if
   pain worsens or persists  despite BM. Changed bowel regimen from prn to
   standing
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   n        fixed and SSI, FSG qid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with extensive cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), pulmonary embolism (PE) on Coumadin, who presented with lethargy and black stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest. 

Medical Complications:
1. CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient's extensive previous cardiac history, including MI and CABG, along with ischemic changes on EKG, elevated Troponin-T levels, and positive MB-index, suggest that the cardiac arrest could have been triggered by myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia. Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 30-35% to 20% was noted on an echocardiogram immediately after the arrest. Re-evaluation of cardiac function is planned in about a week.
2. GI Bleed: The patient's HCT (hematocrit) level was stable after transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), indicating that further transfusions are not needed at this time. The patient will be monitored for any signs of rebleeding.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was successfully extubated and is doing well without respiratory support.
4. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's recent ejection"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed  decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO to eval if improved.
   -- Consult cardiology for recs
   -- will continue to trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy, will re-assess when pt
   extubated.
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will start esmolol drip to
   reduce BP prior to extubation.
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5uints pRBCs.
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt, to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt satting well on pressure support of 15/5
   overnight, reduced to [**11-17**] and then [**7-18**] during morning. Breathing
   well.  Sedation off in the AM.
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- continue to wean off vent during morning
   -- SBTs in afternoon, repeat ABG and lactate
   -- Extubate in PM if improving
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   -1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam, though Cr increased.
   --  will attempt to keep fluid balance even today.
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Increased slightly overnight, possibly
   from diuresis, but CHF w/ EF of 20% more pressing concern.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even today
   -- if worsens consider renal consult for recs
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider retart tomorrow given recent h/o
   PE.
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # ? R hand weakness: Will follow. Upon later exam, pt more awake with
   equal strength. Consider imaging if focal neuro findings.
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now. Will start TF if will not extubate today
   -- replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx
   -- IV PPI gtt
   - SC heparin
   -- no bowel regimen needed given GIB
   .
   # Code - Full code confirmed with family, but if pt deteriorates would
   not want life to be prolonged by life support, will reassess after
   extubation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease including coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient presented with lethargy and black stools, indicating gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He was found to have a GI bleed, which resulted in acute on chronic renal failure and demand ischemia. The patient experienced cardiac arrest, likely triggered by myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased from 30-35% to 20% after the arrest.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient's extensive cardiac history, including previous MI and CABG, increases the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. Continuous cardiac monitoring and management of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia are crucial.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient has ongoing GI bleeding, which requires ongoing evaluation and management. Prophylactic stress ulcer precautions should be continued, and consideration should be given to restarting PPI therapy.

3. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's recent EF of 35% has decreased to 20%, indicating worsening systolic function. Diuresis should be continued, and efforts should be made to maintain fluid balance.

4. Acute Kidney"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of extensive cardiac disease including coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient presented with lethargy and black stools, indicating a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient subsequently experienced cardiac arrest and had an EKG demonstrating changes consistent with ischemia. Troponin T was elevated, but the MB-index was positive, likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered myocardial infarction and potentially led to the cardiac arrest.

The patient's ejection fraction (EF) decreased from 30-35% to 20% post-cardiac arrest, as shown by an echocardiogram immediately after the event. It is planned to re-evaluate the EF in approximately one week. The patient is on cardiac monitoring and continues to receive Plavix and a statin at 80 mg.

The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently on coumadin. However, given the risk of GI bleeding and recurrent demand ischemia, the coumadin is being held for now. The patient is also allergic to aspirin.

The patient has experienced a GI bleed and has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is stable above 30%. The patient is being kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for now and will start enteral feeding if they do not extubate today. Electrolytes are to be replenished as needed.

The patient's renal function is chronic, with a baseline creatinine level of 2.2-2.5 in early [Month]. The creatinine is trending down now, and acute renal failure is likely prerenal in etiology due to recent GI bleed. There is a concern for ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of cardiac arrest. Fluid balance is being maintained, and home lasix is being restarted.

The patient's lactic acidosis is likely from ischemia and has improved. The patient has mild abdominal pain on examination, but lactate levels are trending down. The patient has not had a bowel movement since admission, likely due to constipation. A bowel regimen has been started, and imaging will be considered if the pain worsens or persists despite bowel movement. The bowel regimen has been changed from as-needed to standing.

The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) is managed with fixed and sliding scale insulin (SSI), with a last A1c level of 6.1%. The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is noted, and the patient was reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the setting of GI bleed.

The patient's hypertension is being managed, and antihypertensive medications are being held. Esmolol drip"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient was successfully extubated and reported chest pain at 11:00 PM on [**2124-9-13**]. The patient had a history of CPR and anaphylaxis to aspirin. They were given MS 1.0 mg and two Tylenol for the chest pain. Aspirin was continued to be held. The patient tolerated starting on a PO diet well. 

Vital signs include a temperature range of 36.9-37.6°C (98.4-99.6°F), heart rate of 70 bpm with a range of 49-80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/51 mmHg to 148/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a spontaneous rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula with FiO2 of 50%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 838 mL, including 420 mL by mouth, 358 mL intravenously, and 60 mL through total fluids. Output includes 1815 mL of urine and 360 mL of stool, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 977 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support with a PSV/SBT ventilator mode, using a nasal cannula with an FiO2 of 50%. ABG results show a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 166, and HCO3- of 82 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include non-assessment of peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other systems. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count of 243 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 68 mg/dL, sodium of 21 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, and chloride of 83 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Chest pain: The patient reported chest pain at 11:00 PM on [**2124-9-13**]. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the chest pain and to prevent any potential complications related to cardiac or pulmonary issues.

2. Anaphylaxis: The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to aspirin. It is crucial to avoid exposure to aspirin or any other known allergens to prevent a severe allergic reaction.

3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance of 977 mL, indicating a potential risk for dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to maintain proper hydration and electrolyte levels.

4. Respiratory support: The patient is still on respiratory support with a PSV/S"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Trop-T was
   elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index
   was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have
   triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease, including a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin, who presented with lethargy and black stools. The patient was found to have a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest, and now presents with multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 2.2-2.5 and recent elevation to 3.6 mg/dL. The AKI is likely pre-renal in etiology due to recent GI bleeding, but there is concern for ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of cardiac arrest.

2. Myocardial infarction (MI): The patient's EKG demonstrated changes consistent with ischemia, most likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Elevated troponin-T levels were noted, which may be attributed to acute on chronic renal failure or demand ischemia. The decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 30-35% to 20% after cardiac arrest suggests myocardial injury.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated and on mechanical ventilation but has"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Cardiac Arrest: likely due to demand ischemic on a background of
   ischemic heart failure. Peri arrest echo shows bivent dysfunction
likely better now- hemodynamics stable. Plavix, Statin. Carvedilol and
   Imdur. Appreciate Cardiology consultation.
   2.  Hypoxemic Resp Failure: resolves s/p extubation now on room air
   3.  GI bleed: stable HCT 29.1 after 5 units (last 48 hrs ago) good
   access, IV PPI, GI aware holding off on scope unless fulminant bleeding
   Big issue will be when to restart anti-coagulation since it is for a
   PE. Will discuss with GI when they would even consider scope (if not
   this admit may need low goal inr or low dose lovenox)
   4.  ARF: improved, keep on home Lasix, trend UOP and CR renally dose
   all meds
   5.   Remaining issues as per housetaff notes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed arrest. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and required invasive ventilation. He also complained of chest pain at night and received morphine and Tylenol.

The patient has allergies to aspirin and anaphylaxis. He is currently on various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 171/67 mmHg to 174/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula with PSV/SBT ventilation.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 838 mL total input and 1,815 mL total output, with a negative balance of 977 mL. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, ventilator mode set at PSV/SBT, Vt ranging from 552-679 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 15 breaths per minute, PEEP of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 11 cmH2O, and SpO2 of"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Cardiac Arrest: likely due to demand ischemic on a background of
   ischemic heart failure. Peri arrest echo shows bivent dysfunction
likely better now- hemodynamics stable. Plavix, Statin. Carvedilol and
   Imdur. Appreciate Cardiology consultation.
   2.  Hypoxemic Resp Failure: resolves s/p extubation now on room air
   3.  GI bleed: stable HCT 29.1 after 5 units (last 48 hrs ago) good
   access, IV PPI, GI aware holding off on scope unless fulminant bleeding
   4.  ARF: improved, keep on home Lasix, trend UOP and CR renally dose
   all meds
   5.   Remaining issues as per housstaff notes
