   # Respiratory distress: [**1-1**] pneumonia (viral vs CAP vs aspiration),
   pulm edema, anxiety. CT chest w multifocal PNA. Hypoxic, tachypneic.
   Influenza negative.
   - vanc/CTX/azithro ([**5-13**] - ) for CAP
   - check sputum cx, if possible
   - check urine S. pneumoniae AG
   - f/u bl cxs, urine cx, legionella AG
   - goal: negative -500cc per 24 hrs
   - lorazepam for anxiety
   - O2 supplementation to maintain O2 sats > 94%.
   # N/V/D: resolved.
   # Headache: unclear etiology, possibly in the setting of acute illness.
   CT head unremarkable.
   - Morphine prn for pain
   - hold off on panorex
   .
   # ARF: likely prerenal in the setting of N/V/D and decreased PO intake.
   Cr 1.8 on admission. Resolved w fluids.

   # Tranaminitis: Slight elevation in AST/ALT/alkphos but TBili wnl.
   Abdominal pain is not localized to RUQ.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Follow-up final read CT abd/pelvis.
   - Check CK as slight elevation in AST/ALT may be related to muscle
   pathology rather than hepatobiliary pathology.
   - Ok to continue statin for now as LFTs are only mildly elevated.
   .
   # AG metabolic acidosis - No known h/o ingestions. Not significantly
   hyperglycemic, and lactate wnl in ED. [**Month (only) 11**] also have underlying non-gap
   metabolic acidosis contributing to HCO3 of 19 secondary to diarrhea and
   NS resuscitation in ED.
   - Trend HCO3.
   - Consider switching IVFs to LR.
   - If HCO3 worsens, will check ABG or VBG.
   .
   # HTN - Although pt with multi-focal PNA, she does not meet criteria
   for sepsis and has not been hypotensive in the ED.
   - Hold metoprolol for now given relative hypotension and poor po
   intake.
   .
   # s/p [**Month (only) **] - With clean coronaries on cath, thus it was unclear if
   [**Name (NI) **] was actually [**1-1**] ruptured plaque vs. coronary artery spasm.
   Recent ETT [**4-7**] with atypical anginal sxs and without ischemic EKG
   changes. CE negative X 1.
   - Continue aspirin, statin.
   - Holding beta-blocker as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and previous coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's initial assessment and plan included respiratory distress due to pneumonia (viral vs. community-acquired pneumonia vs. aspiration), pulmonary edema, and anxiety. She was given antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, and other diagnostic tests were ordered. The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have resolved. She also had acute kidney injury (ARF) likely caused by prerenal factors, which resolved with fluids. There was a slight elevation in liver enzymes, but this was not localized to the right upper quadrant. The patient has metabolic acidosis, which is non-gap and likely secondary to diarrhea and normal saline resuscitation. She does not meet criteria for sepsis and has not been hypotensive. Her hypertension is being managed with medications, but the beta-blocker is being held due to poor oral intake and relative hypotension. The patient had a recent cardiac catheterization that showed clean coronaries, and she has a history of atypical angina symptoms without ischemic EKG changes. She is being continued on aspirin and statin therapy. Her depression and anxiety medication, sertraline, is being"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and previous STEMI.
- She presents with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
- She is experiencing hypoxia and has multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and her current antibiotics include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.
- She also has elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving oxygen therapy.
- Her renal function is impaired, likely due to pre-renal causes.
- Other conditions include headache, metabolic acidosis, and depression/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen due to the ongoing pneumonia and potential development of complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is already impaired, and further deterioration may occur if adequate fluid management and medication adjustments are not made.
3. Headache: The patient's headache could be related to her acute illness or may indicate an underlying condition such as meningitis or increased intracranial pressure.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis could progress if not properly managed and monitored.
5. Pneumonia Complications: Pneumonia can lead to various complications such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a previous STEMI. She was admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea/vomiting, and hypoxia. The patient has multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray and a CT scan showing multifocal pneumonia. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/65 mmHg to 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Vanc, CTX, azithro), furosemide, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presents with hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on CXR, which could indicate pneumonia (viral vs. community-acquired pneumonia vs. aspiration) or pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, likely of pulmonary origin. However, due to recent dental work and possible pneumococcus infection, an echocardiogram has been ordered to evaluate for endocarditis.
3. Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms have resolved. It is important"

   myalgias, n/v/d and found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates
   on CXR.
   .
   #) Fever, hypoxia - Likely [**1-1**] multi-focal PNA seen on CXR. Most likely
   due to infectious causes including community acquired PNA, aspiration
   PNA, legionella PNA, possible bacterial superinfection of initial viral
   infection. Less likely that infiltrates are secondary to
   pulmonary-renal syndrome as not many RBC on UA and there are other
   likely causes for her ARF.
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, ceftriaxone,
   azithromycin.
   - Check urinary legionella antigen.
   - Obtain sputum culture.
   - Given constellation of symptoms, will recheck RRVS to r/o flu and
   place on droplet precautions. Hold on giving tamiflu for now.
   - f/u blood cultures.
   - O2 supplementation to maintain O2 sats > 94%.
   - Tylenol prn
   - Droplet precautions
   .
   #) N/V/D - Given multi-focal infiltrates on CXR and presence of GI
   symptoms, legionella remains on differential. Other possible causes
   include viral gastroenteritis, c. diff as had recent abx exposure from
   dental procedure although no signs of colitis on CT, other possible
   bacterial causes of colitis, and possible hepatobiliary pathology given
   slight elevation in LFTs. Doubt ischemic cause.
   - f/u final read CT abd/pelvis.
   - IVFs X 2 additional liters as above.
   - Clear liquid diet and advance as tolerated.
   - Check urinary legionella as above.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Anti-emetics prn.
   - Checked lipase, wnl.
   - Rule out for c. diff given recent abx exposure.
   - Monitor Hct and guaiac stools given pt's report of 1 bloody BM. Hct
   is currently 41.3. Send type and screen.
   .
   #) Headache - Per pt, having worst HA of life. Has been ongoing for
   several days so doubt emergent etiologies such as SAH or SDH given the
   fact that her MS is still intact and neurologic exam non-localizing
   other than decreased sensation on left, which appears to be a long
   standing issue in OMR. However, these etiologies must be ruled out.
   Suspect that she has worsening of her baseline HAs in setting of
   infection. Also on differential is meningitis given her complaints of
   photophobia and neck pain. However, her exam does not clearly support a
   diagnosis of meningitis and doubt bacterial cause for this as pt would
   likely be sicker by now as has had 5 days of symptoms.
   - Stat NCHCT.
   - Morphine prn for pain.
   - Consider lumbar puncture to r/o meningitis if has worsening meningeal
   signs, fevers.
   .
   #) ARF - Suspect that rise in Cr is related prerenal causes given poor
   po intake in setting of n/v/d.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - IVFs X 2 additional liters @ 150 cc/hr (TTE in [**4-7**] with EF 70%).
   - Renal U/S and urine sediment if no improvement in Cr with IVFs.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, including home toradol.
   .
   #) Tranaminitis - Slight elevation in AST/ALT/alkphos but TBili wnl.
   Abdominal pain is not localized to RUQ.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Follow-up final read CT abd/pelvis.
   - Check CK as slight elevation in AST/ALT may be related to muscle
   pathology rather than hepatobiliary pathology.
   - Ok to continue statin for now as LFTs are only mildly elevated.
   .
   #) AG metabolic acidosis - No known h/o ingestions. Not significantly
   hyperglycemic, and lactate wnl in ED. [**Month (only) 11**] also have underlying non-gap
   metabolic acidosis contributing to HCO3 of 19 secondary to diarrhea and
   NS resuscitation in ED.
   - Trend HCO3.
   - Consider switching IVFs to LR.
   - If HCO3 worsens, will check ABG or VBG.
   .
   #) HTN - Although pt with multi-focal PNA, she does not meet criteria
   for sepsis and has not been hypotensive in the ED.
   - Hold metoprolol for now given relative hypotension and poor po
   intake.
   .
   #) s/p [**Month (only) **] - With clean coronaries on cath, thus it was unclear if
   [**Name (NI) **] was actually [**1-1**] ruptured plaque vs. coronary artery spasm.
   Recent ETT [**4-7**] with atypical anginal sxs and without ischemic EKG
   changes. CE negative X 1.
   - Continue aspirin, statin.
   - Holding beta-blocker as above.
   - ROMI given pt is diabetic and with sxs of n/v. Low clinical suspicion
   for ACS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. She presents with fevers, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient has hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She is also experiencing headaches, renal failure, and possible pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, fevers, and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest a possible infectious cause such as community-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Broad antibiotic coverage should be continued, and further tests like sputum culture and urinary legionella antigen should be checked.

2. Legionella Pneumonia: Given the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), Legionella remains on the differential diagnosis. Other possible causes include viral gastroenteritis, Clostridium difficile infection, and other bacterial causes of colitis.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal failure. It is suspected to be prerenal in origin due to poor oral intake caused by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient should receive IV fluids and medications should be renally dosed. Renal ultrasound and urine sediment analysis may be necessary if there is no improvement in creatinine levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She presents with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. She has hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress due to multi-focal pneumonia, which is worse this morning. Differential diagnoses include pneumonia secondary to Staphylococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, atypical organisms (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), aspiration pneumonia. Other less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia are also considered. Legionella and influenza tests are negative. The patient has a negative fluid balance of 1.6 liters yesterday. She is receiving vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. The plan includes adding doxycycline if the patient's clinical status worsens, sending serologies for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia, attempting sputum culture, and obtaining consent for an HIV test.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and previous myocardial infarction. She presents with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia, which is worse on this morning's chest X-ray. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and hypoxia, along with the presence of multi-focal infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicate pneumonia. Complications of pneumonia can include respiratory distress, sepsis, and organ dysfunction.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a history of recent nausea, vomiting, and decreased oral intake, which could have led to pre-renal azotemia. The elevated creatinine level on admission (1.8) and subsequent improvement with fluids suggest a possible diagnosis of ARF. If not managed appropriately, ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.

3. Hyperthermia: The patient's fever could be due to an underlying infection or inflammatory process. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as sepsis or organ dysfunction.

4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea should be monitored closely, as it can result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances"

   54 yo F with h/o DM II, HTN, [**Year (4 digits) **] who presents with fevers, cough,
   myalgias, n/v/d and found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates
   on CXR.
   .
   #) Fever, hypoxia - Likely [**1-1**] multi-focal PNA seen on CXR. Most likely
   due to infectious causes including community acquired PNA, aspiration
   PNA, legionella PNA, possible bacterial superinfection of initial viral
   infection. Less likely that infiltrates are secondary to
   pulmonary-renal syndrome as not many RBC on UA and there are other
   likely causes for her ARF.
   - Continue broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, ceftriaxone,
   azithromycin.
   - Check urinary legionella antigen.
   - Obtain sputum culture.
   - Given constellation of symptoms, will recheck RRVS to r/o flu and
   place on droplet precautions. Hold on giving tamiflu for now.
   - f/u blood cultures.
   - O2 supplementation to maintain O2 sats > 94%.
   - Tylenol prn
   - Droplet precautions
   .
   #) N/V/D - Given multi-focal infiltrates on CXR and presence of GI
   symptoms, legionella remains on differential. Other possible causes
   include viral gastroenteritis, c. diff as had recent abx exposure from
   dental procedure although no signs of colitis on CT, other possible
   bacterial causes of colitis, and possible hepatobiliary pathology given
   slight elevation in LFTs. Doubt ischemic cause.
   - f/u final read CT abd/pelvis.
   - IVFs X 2 additional liters as above.
   - Clear liquid diet and advance as tolerated.
   - Check urinary legionella as above.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Anti-emetics prn.
   - Checked lipase, wnl.
   - Rule out for c. diff given recent abx exposure.
   - Monitor Hct and guaiac stools given pt's report of 1 bloody BM. Hct
   is currently 41.3. Send type and screen.
   .
   #) Headache - Per pt, having worst HA of life. Has been ongoing for
   several days so doubt emergent etiologies such as SAH or SDH given the
   fact that her MS is still intact and neurologic exam non-localizing
   other than decreased sensation on left, which appears to be a long
   standing issue in OMR. However, these etiologies must be ruled out.
   Suspect that she has worsening of her baseline HAs in setting of
   infection. Also on differential is meningitis given her complaints of
   photophobia and neck pain. However, her exam does not clearly support a
   diagnosis of meningitis and doubt bacterial cause for this as pt would
   likely be sicker by now as has had 5 days of symptoms.
   - Stat NCHCT.
   - Morphine prn for pain.
   - Consider lumbar puncture to r/o meningitis if has worsening meningeal
   signs, fevers.
   .
   #) ARF - Suspect that rise in Cr is related prerenal causes given poor
   po intake in setting of n/v/d.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - IVFs X 2 additional liters @ 150 cc/hr (TTE in [**4-7**] with EF 70%).
   - Renal U/S and urine sediment if no improvement in Cr with IVFs.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, including home toradol.
   .
   #) Tranaminitis - Slight elevation in AST/ALT/alkphos but TBili wnl.
   Abdominal pain is not localized to RUQ.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Follow-up final read CT abd/pelvis.
   - Check CK as slight elevation in AST/ALT may be related to muscle
   pathology rather than hepatobiliary pathology.
   - Ok to continue statin for now as LFTs are only mildly elevated.
   .
   #) AG metabolic acidosis - No known h/o ingestions. Not significantly
   hyperglycemic, and lactate wnl in ED. [**Month (only) 11**] also have underlying non-gap
   metabolic acidosis contributing to HCO3 of 19 secondary to diarrhea and
   NS resuscitation in ED.
   - Trend HCO3.
   - Consider switching IVFs to LR.
   - If HCO3 worsens, will check ABG or VBG.
   .
   #) HTN - Although pt with multi-focal PNA, she does not meet criteria
   for sepsis and has not been hypotensive in the ED.
   - Hold metoprolol for now given relative hypotension and poor po
   intake.
   .
   #) s/p [**Month (only) **] - With clean coronaries on cath, thus it was unclear if
   [**Name (NI) **] was actually [**1-1**] ruptured plaque vs. coronary artery spasm.
   Recent ETT [**4-7**] with atypical anginal sxs and without ischemic EKG
   changes. CE negative X 1.
   - Continue aspirin, statin.
   - Holding beta-blocker as above.
   - ROMI given pt is diabetic and with sxs of n/v. Low clinical suspicion
   for ACS.
   .
   #) Depression/anxiety - Continue sertraline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension who presents with fevers, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She has hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions, including pneumonia, acute renal failure, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and potential depression/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multi-focal pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest a possible infection in the lungs. This could lead to worsening respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. This could progress to complete renal failure if not properly managed, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for dialysis.
3. Headache: The patient complains of severe headaches. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to increased intracranial pressure, potential brain herniation, and neurological deterioration.
4. Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. If left untreated, these symptoms could worsen, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
5. Fever: The patient's persistent fever may suggest an ongoing infection or"

   2. Headache: similar to her chronic headache but worse, non con head CT
   normal, no localizing signs.  No focal neuro findings.  If patient
   respiratory status improves (or if she ends up on the ventilator), then
   we will perform LP.
   3. Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: resolved
   4. Depression/anxiety: continue Zoloft
   Addendum: Patient became more tachyapneic and repeat ABG revealed
   worsening hypoxia.  Thus, patient required endotracheal intubation.
   Patient intubated without complication.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress due to multifocal pneumonia. The worsening hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a possible worsening of the respiratory condition. This could lead to further respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a significant fluid balance negative of 1.6 L in the past 24 hours, which can contribute to dehydration and potential kidney injury. The elevated serum creatinine levels also suggest possible renal impairment.

3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may indicate gastrointestinal issues. These symptoms could be secondary to the underlying infection or due to other causes such as stress or medications.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been relatively low, with readings below 120/80 mmHg. This could be due to sepsis or other factors contributing to hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation may be necessary.

5. Thromboembolic Events: As the patient has a history of DM2 and HTN, she is at an increased risk of developing thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular weight heparin, should be considered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia, which is worse on the morning's chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia secondary to Staphylococcus, pneumococcal, atypical organisms (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), and aspiration pneumonia. Less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia are also considered. Legionella and influenza tests were negative. The patient's fluid status is negative, with a deficit of 1.6 liters yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's current condition suggests a severe case of pneumonia. If not appropriately treated, it may lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level, indicating impaired kidney function. This could be due to dehydration, sepsis, or direct involvement of the kidneys by the infection.

She presents with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes community-acquired pneumonia secondary to Staphylococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, atypical organisms (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), aspiration pneumonia, as well as less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Blood cultures are pending, and serologies for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia are being followed up.

The patient also has a history of headache, which is chronic and unremarkable on CT scan. An MRI/MRA was unremarkable prior to admission, and there is low suspicion of meningitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and previous non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She required intubation due to respiratory distress, which was attributed to multi-focal pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus, pneumococcus, atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia, aspiration pneumonia, and less common etiologies like Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia. Legionella and influenza tests were negative. An autoimmune etiology is also considered. 

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and cefepime. Vancomycin is continued, and doxycycline may be considered if the patient's clinical status worsens. Gentle diuresis is planned, and further investigations such as serologies for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia, as well as urine Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen, blood cultures, and HIV test are recommended. ANCA testing is also advised to evaluate for vasculitis.

The patient is currently experiencing acute kidney injury"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia.

The differential diagnosis includes:

1. Bacterial pneumonia secondary to Staphylococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or atypical bacteria.
2. Aspiration pneumonia.
3. Less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia.
4. Autoimmune etiology.

The plan includes changing the antibiotic therapy to cover atypical bacteria (cefepime) while continuing vancomycin and azithromycin. Doxycycline may be considered if the patient's clinical status worsens. Serologies for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia will be followed up. Urine Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen, blood cultures, and urine cultures will also be monitored. An HIV test will be sent, and the patient will be evaluated for vasculitis with ANCA testing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and NSTEMI. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient required intubation for respiratory distress due to multi-focal pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes community-acquired pneumonia secondary to staphylococcus, pneumococcus, atypical organisms (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), aspiration pneumonia, and less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress due to multi-focal pneumonia.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF) possibly pre-renal caused by hypotension, sepsis, or autoimmune vasculitis.
3. Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea which could be due to infections or medications.
4. Headache with a history of chronic headaches, unremarkable CT head, and prior MRI/MRA.
5. Transaminitis with slight elevation in AST/ALT/alkphos but within normal limits for TBili.
6. Hypertension requiring management.
7. History of NSTEMI with the need to continue ASA and Statin.
8. Depression/anxiety being treated with sertraline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was intubated due to respiratory distress and diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial pneumonia secondary to Staphylococcus, pneumococcal, atypical pathogens (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), aspiration pneumonia, and less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia. Initial tests for Legionella and influenza were negative, and autoimmune workup was also negative. She has been treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, vancomycin, and oseltamivir. She continues to have fevers and has been started on doxycycline. Further tests including serologies for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia, urine Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen, blood cultures, and HIV test are planned. She remains mechanically ventilated and her ABGs will be monitored. A mini BAL may be considered. The patient is also suspected to have acute kidney injury, possibly pre-renal due to hypotension"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Upon admission, she was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress caused by multi-focal pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia secondary to staphylococcus, pneumococcal, atypical organisms (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), and aspiration pneumonia. Less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia were also considered.

The patient's fevers continued despite treatment with antibiotics. An autoimmune workup was negative, and she received ceftriaxone. The plan includes continuing vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and adding doxycycline. Pan-culture was obtained when her temperature spikes. Gentle diuresis was considered, aiming for a negative fluid balance of -500cc per 24 hours. Serologies for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, and Babesia were ordered, along with urine Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen testing. Blood cultures, urine culture, and an HIV test"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted with symptoms of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia. She was found to have multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient required intubation and is currently on mechanical ventilation with PEEP of 20, RR of 30, and FiO2 of 60%. She has been receiving various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, meropenem, linezolid, and doxycycline. The patient continues to have fevers and has negative serologies for influenza, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Her autoimmune workup is negative, and she is HIV-negative. She has been off steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress due to multi-focal pneumonia requiring intubation.
2. Anemia likely due to dilutional causes.
3. Acute renal failure possibly pre-renal in nature due to hypotension and sepsis.
4. Headache with unremarkable CT head and prior MRI/MRA.
5. Transaminitis with slight elevation in AST/ALT/alkphos but normal TBili"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On admission, she had hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's respiratory distress required intubation, and she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin) and antiviral therapy (oseltamivir). Despite these treatments, she continues to have fevers.

The differential diagnosis includes community-acquired pneumonia secondary to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, atypical organisms (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae), aspiration pneumonia, and less common etiologies such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Coxiella burnetii, Babesia microti, and Legionella pneumophila. Influenza was negative.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis.

The patient's plan includes continuing meropenem and linezolid, stopping paralytics, considering gentle diuresis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and NSTEMI.
- She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea/vomiting, and hypoxia, along with multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- She was diagnosed with respiratory distress due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
- Initial treatment included antibiotics (ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin), oseltamivir, and steroids.
- Steroids and paralytics were stopped.
- Current medications include meropenem, linezolid, and azithromycin.
- The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing fevers, hypoxia, and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- Other assessments include anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), facial swelling (possibly due to volume overload, drug reaction, or clot), and transient headache (with unremarkable CT head and prior unremarkable MRI/MRA).
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/49 to 120/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, which can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Facial Swelling: The cause of facial swelling is unclear, and it may be due to volume overload, drug reaction, or a clot. Monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent airway compromise.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and low urine output. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which can result in tissue hypoxia and increased fatigue. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and providing appropriate transfusions if necessary is important.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, indicating possible liver involvement. Monitoring liver enzymes and assessing for signs of liver failure is crucial.
6. Infection: Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition suggests ongoing infection. Cultures and sensitivities should be monitored to guide appropriate antibiotic treatment.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's facial swelling could also be indicative of a DVT. An ultrasound examination of both upper extremities should be considered to evaluate for DVT.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and management of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include an elevated temperature of 101.3°F, tenuous blood pressure, and the administration of multiple antibiotics. The patient's allergies include atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin. His last dose of antibiotics was given on 05/18/2170 at 9:04 AM.

The patient is receiving various infusions, including fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, and furosemide. He also has several ongoing medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Vital signs show a temperature of 100.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 67/42 mmHg to 93/58 mmHg, heart rate between 72-98 bpm, respiratory rate at 20-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,967 mL, including 760 mL of crystalloids, 935 mL of total fluids, and 1,662 mL of IV fluids. Output includes 1,250 mL of blood products, 760 mL of urine, and 100 mL of nasogastric (NG) drainage. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL and respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, with a PEEP of 20 cmH2O and FiO2 of 60%.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.5 g/dL and a leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.3 K/uL. Blood cultures were taken on 05/19/2170 at 4:10 AM, 4:45 AM, 9:53 AM, 2:05 PM, 4:33 PM, 8:11 PM, and 8:25 PM, and again on 05/20/2170 at 12:38 AM and 4:38 AM. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of pneumonia/ARDS/respiratory failure, awaiting today's bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), continuing the current antibiotic regimen, and weaning the patient off the ventilator as tolerated. The patient's hypotension will be closely monitored, and diuresis may be initiated if appropriate. The cause of the fever needs to be identified through cultures,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and renal failure. The patient also has a fever with a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

From the vital signs, the patient's heart rate (HR) is within normal range at 74 beats per minute. The blood pressure (BP) is on the lower side but stable at 101/49 mmHg. The respiratory rate (RR) is slightly elevated at 30 breaths per minute, which may be due to mechanical ventilation. The oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at 97%, indicating good oxygenation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,967 mL and output of 1,250 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,717 mL. This suggests that the patient may be receiving more fluids than needed or is not excreting enough urine.

Regarding the lab results, the patient has an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated platelet count (Plt). The blood glucose level is high at 203 mg/dL. Other lab values show abnormalities in liver enzymes (ALT/AST), electrolytes (Na+/K+/Cl-), and kidney function markers (creatinine/Cr, blood urea nitrogen/BUN)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 20 cmH2O. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other ICU medications. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/49 mmHg to 120/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and low potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is impaired as evidenced by oliguria/anuria and elevated creatinine level. There is also evidence of liver dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient's respiratory support and medication regimen remain unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or quantity is essential.
2. Acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, ARDS, and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with ongoing mechanical ventilation. Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition has not improved, as indicated by persistent fever and unrevealing microbiology results. The patient's vital signs remain tenuous, with fluctuating blood pressure and low urine output. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and signs of electrolyte imbalances. The patient is also anemic, with a low hemoglobin level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/ARDS progression: The patient's underlying pneumonia and ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's persistent fever suggests ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's tenuous blood pressure indicates potential cardiovascular instability, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, which may require dialysis.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia, which can cause tissue hypoxia and fatigue.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalc"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction who presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and fevers, initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin. The patient's allergies include atorvastatin, ibuprofen, levofloxacin, and hives. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.4°F (39.8°C), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 111/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals swollen mouth, distant heart sounds, crackles throughout the chest, and diffuse tenderness to palpation. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L. Blood cultures have been obtained and are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. She has been febrile and experiencing worsening renal function, with urine output decreasing to less than 500cc per 24 hours. Other findings include face swelling, anemia, headache, transaminitis, hypertension, and depression/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
2. Oliguria/anuria due to acute renal failure.
3. Headache of unknown origin.
4. Nausea/vomiting.
5. Diarrhea.
6. Possible drug allergy or angioedema.
7. Chronic anemia.
8. Acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal in nature.
9. Fatty liver on abdominal CT.
10. History of NSTEMI.
11. Depression/anxiety.

Please note that the patient's condition is critical, and prompt medical attention is necessary."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, possibly due to CAP (Community Acquired Pneumonia) or ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are concerns for oral mucosal swelling, possibly related to medications or an underlying process. The patient has a fever, hypotension, and anemia. They also have a history of NIDDM (Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus). The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, and nutritional support. The patient's condition remains unstable, and they are being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been mechanically ventilated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function. Close monitoring and diuresis may be necessary to manage fluid levels.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications. The healthcare team should closely monitor blood pressure and administer appropriate interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which may indicate"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, hypoxia, and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The initial differential diagnosis included community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, and less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia, and Mycoplasma. The patient was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals, but her condition did not improve. Subsequent tests ruled out HIV, Mycoplasma, chlamydia, Legionella, and Babesia infections. The patient developed facial swelling, and it was determined to be likely angioedema possibly caused by a drug reaction. The angioedema improved after stopping suspected drugs. The patient's respiratory distress and fevers persist, and further workup is pending for less common causes of pneumonia. The patient's oliguria/anuria, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, and fever are also being evaluated. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, decreased FiO2 to 50%, maintained PEEP at 18, decreased sedation 20% per day, and receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The patient's anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), headache, transaminitis, hypertension, and history of NSTEMI are also being managed."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was admitted with complaints of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia. The patient was found to have multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray and was diagnosed with respiratory distress/fevers. The cause of the pneumonia is still unknown and less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia, and others have been considered.

The patient has been on various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, and doxycycline. Her condition has been complicated by oliguria/anuria, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, and facial swelling. The facial swelling is of unclear etiology and may be due to volume overload, drug reaction, or possible clot. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable with fluctuating blood pressures and temperatures. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with decreased PEEP from 20 to 18. Her laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, abnormal liver function tests, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current medications include"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, and fever. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and antivirals without improvement. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has facial swelling of unclear etiology. Other medical issues include anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), transaminitis, hypertension, and depression/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and daily sputum cultures are necessary.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, characterized by low urine output and elevated creatinine levels. Monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial. Diuretics may be used to manage fluid overload.
3. Infection: Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient continues to have fevers. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals have been given, but no organism has been identified yet. Cultures should be monitored, and additional tests should be performed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted with complaints of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, and vomiting. On examination, she had hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia, oliguria/anuria, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, and fever. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she requires ongoing medical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to severe pneumonia. Continued support with mechanical ventilation and careful monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are crucial.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia seems to be caused by an unknown pathogen. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted multiple times based on culture results. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or development of drug resistance.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's low urine output indicates possible acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary. Diuretics may be used to manage fluid overload and maintain adequate urine output.
4. Headache: The patient has a chronic headache, but no specific cause has been identified. Continued monitoring and reassessment of the patient's neurological status are required."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, CAP of unclear etiology.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia,
   possible ARDS.  Now possible VAP.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.  Treat oral swelling.  Begin tapering
   sedation as tolerated.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP -->
   reasonable to continue complete course for atypical organisms.  Now
   with concern for VAP(green purulent sputum by BAL) --> plan targetd
   antimicorbials.  Continue Vanco, Meropenim, Doxicycline.
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema, possibly related to
   underlying process or related to medications.  Continue steroids.
   PNEUMONIA / ARDS / respiratory failure
 micro remain unrevealing,
   continue current abx regimen, wean vent as tolerated
 decrease RR and
   FiO2 today.  Meropenim, Vanco, Doxicycline per ID service.
   HYPOTENSION -- follow BP, diurese as tolerated.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.  Now vaginal bleeding (minimal).
   VAGINAL BLEEDING
 need to confirm active mensces.  [**Month (only) 11**] require vaginal
   exam if increased and persistent.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 monitor.  [**Month (only) 11**] need free water replacement.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected CAP and VAP, as well as steroids for oral mucosal swelling. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hypernatremia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's condition remains unstable, and the medical team is closely monitoring various parameters including fluid balance, glucose levels, and electrolyte levels. The patient's code status is set to full code, indicating that all possible measures should be taken to save the patient's life. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires ongoing critical care."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. There is a concern for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) but it has been ruled out.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has multi-focal infiltrates on CXR (chest X-ray) and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The cause of pneumonia is still unknown, with less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, and Babesia being considered.

3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output has been low, indicating a potential kidney problem, possibly acute renal failure.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. This could be due to pre-renal causes such as hypotension and sepsis.

5. Fever/Hypothermia: The patient has persistent high fevers despite clinical improvement, which could be due to an ongoing infection or other causes like serotonin syndrome or autoimmune etiology.

6. Facial Swelling: The patient experienced facial swelling, which is currently being treated as a possible drug reaction. It could be angioedema, but further evaluation is needed.

7. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, indicating anemia. It is likely dilutional in nature.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support with a low respiratory rate set (RR Set: 28) and a relatively high tidal volume (Vt: 350 mL). This suggests the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other forms of respiratory failure.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The note mentions impaired skin integrity, which may indicate the presence of pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.

3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has a decreased urine output, which could be indicative of renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.

4. Headache: The patient is experiencing headaches, which may be related to increased intracranial pressure or other neurological issues.

5. Pneumonia: The presence of fever and respiratory symptoms suggests the possibility of pneumonia.

6. Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These could be due to various causes, including infections or medications.

7. Renal Failure: The elevated levels of creatinine, urea, and potassium indicate the possibility of acute renal failure.

8. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, which may be due to an underlying infection or other causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She was admitted with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. She is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and other less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. She has also been given meropenem and restarted on vancomycin. The patient's fever persists, and further investigations are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. She is mechanically ventilated, and her FiO2 has been decreased to 50% while maintaining PEEP at 16.

2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is experiencing reduced urine output, which could indicate acute renal failure.

3. Headache: The patient has a chronic headache, but no significant findings on CT head or prior MRI/MRA. There is low suspicion of meningitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's respiratory distress and fevers are attributed to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, with possible less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia being considered. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and antiviral medications without improvement. An autoimmune workup was negative, and she tested negative for HIV. Steroids have been discontinued. 

The patient experienced facial swelling, which is thought to be angioedema possibly due to a drug reaction. She has been switched to doxycycline and linezolid has been stopped. The patient has stable anemia, possibly dilutional earlier, and acute renal failure (ARF) that is resolving. Her serum sodium and creatinine levels are being monitored, and medications are being renally dosed. 

The patient also has chronic headaches with unremarkable CT and MRI results. Her liver enzymes are slightly elevated, but her bilirubin level is within normal limits. She has a history of hypertension and was recently treated for NSTEMI."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's condition is summarized as follows:
- Impaired skin integrity
- Respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome)
- Oliguria/anuria
- Headache
- Pneumonia (other)
- Nausea/vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Acute renal failure
- Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics and antiviral medications. Her autoimmune workup was negative, and she tested negative for HIV. The patient's sputum culture grew gram-positive cocci in clusters in the anaerobic bottle, but no organism was identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. Other tests, including Legionella, Aspergillus, and urine histopathology, were also negative.

The patient's current plan includes continuing meropenem and vancomycin for 8-day courses, starting doxycycline, diuresis with lasix, and further evaluation of urine S. pneumoniae antigen, Legionella, and L"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She presents with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory distress, fever, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, renal failure, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and oliguria/anuria. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications without improvement. Further investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of her symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other forms of pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation are necessary.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output indicate acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray and symptoms such as fever, cough, and hypoxia suggest pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued based on culture and sensitivity results.
4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury or urinary tract obstruction. Further evaluation with imaging studies and renal function tests is needed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Fever: The patient has had a fever with a spike to 103.1 despite the continued use of a cooling blanket. This indicates that the patient may be experiencing an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP at 16 cmH2O. These settings suggest that the patient has impaired gas exchange and is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation on their own.

3. Impaired skin integrity: There is no specific mention of skin breakdown or pressure ulcers in the provided information. However, due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and immobilization from mechanical ventilation, they are at risk for developing pressure ulcers.

4. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's urine output has been reported as low (960 mL/24 hours), indicating a potential issue with kidney function.

5. Headache: The patient is experiencing headaches, which could be related to several factors including increased intracranial pressure, electrolyte imbalances, or medications.

6. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs. The exact causative organism is not specified in the provided information.

7. Nausea/vomiting: The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which could be due to medications, stress, or"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, CAP of unclear etiology, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia,
   possible ARDS.  Now possible VAP.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.  Treat oral swelling.  Begin tapering
   sedation as tolerated.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP -->
   reasonable to continue complete course for atypical organisms.  Now
   with concern for VAP(green purulent sputum by BAL) --> plan targetd
   antimicorbials.  Continue Vanco, Meropenim, Doxicycline.
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema, possibly related to
   underlying process or related to medications.  Improving.  Continue
   steroids.
   PNEUMONIA / ARDS / respiratory failure
 micro remain unrevealing,
   continue current abx regimen, wean vent as tolerated
 decrease RR and
   FiO2 today.  Meropenim, Vanco, Doxicycline per ID service.
   HYPOTENSION -- follow BP, diurese as tolerated.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
 recurrent, mild.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.  Now vaginal bleeding (minimal).
   VAGINAL BLEEDING
 need to confirm active mensces.  [**Month (only) 11**] require vaginal
   exam if increased and persistent.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 monitor.  [**Month (only) 11**] need free water replacement.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, unclear etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient exhibits persistent fevers overnight. They have a history of allergies to atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.3°F (39.6°C), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/74 mmHg to 149/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for constitutional symptoms and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight status, and normal cardiovascular findings. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to lung pneumonia, ARDS, and potential VAP. They are being treated with multiple antibiotics, steroids for oral mucosal swelling, and sedation reduction as tolerated. Other concerns include hypotension, fluid balance, fever, lactic acidosis, anemia, vaginal bleeding, NIDDM, hypernatremia, and nutritional support. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, arterial and multi-l"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, CAP of unclear etiology, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia,
   possible ARDS.  Now possible VAP.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.  Treat oral swelling.  Begin tapering
   sedation as tolerated.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP -->
   reasonable to continue complete course for atypical organisms.  Now
   with concern for VAP(green purulent sputum by BAL) --> plan targetd
   antimicorbials.  Continue Vanco, Meropenim, Doxicycline.
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema, possibly related to
   underlying process or related to medications.  Improving.  Continue
   steroids.
   PNEUMONIA / ARDS / respiratory failure
 micro remain unrevealing,
   continue current abx regimen, wean vent as tolerated
 decrease RR and
   FiO2 today.  Meropenim, Vanco, Doxicycline per ID service.
   HYPOTENSION -- follow BP, diurese as tolerated.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS
 recurrent, mild.  Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.  Now vaginal bleeding (minimal).
   VAGINAL BLEEDING
 need to confirm active mensces.  [**Month (only) 11**] require vaginal
   exam if increased and persistent.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 monitor.  [**Month (only) 11**] need free water replacement.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 TF at goal.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have been experiencing persistent fevers overnight and continue to exhibit signs of respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes CAP of unclear etiology, ARDS, and now there are concerns for VAP. The patient has allergies to Atorvastatin, Ibuprofen, and Levofloxacin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and they require mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in lung function.
2. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of unclear etiology, and now there are concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This increases the risk of infection spread and potential sepsis.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory distress and may require additional interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating possible hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and increase the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. This can contribute to tissue hypoxia and further compromise organ function.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, suggesting poorly controlled diabetes. This increases the risk of infections and complications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, which can cause dehydration and neurological symptoms.
8. Malnutrition: The patient requires nutritional support due to their inability to take food orally.
9. Vaginal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing minimal vaginal bleeding, which may require further investigation and management.

These are potential medical complications based on the provided information. It is important to note that the patient's condition should be closely monitored by healthcare professionals in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, and fever. The cause of the respiratory distress/fevers is still unknown, with possible etiologies including multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Other less common causes such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia, and autoimmune diseases have been ruled out.

The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, meropenem, and doxycycline. Her current medications include furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.3°F, blood pressure ranging from 115/52 mmHg to 156/139 mmHg, heart rate between 77-99 bpm, respiratory rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, CAP of unclear etiology, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia,
   possible ARDS.  Now possible VAP.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.  Treat oral swelling.  Begin tapering
   sedation as tolerated.  Weaning PEEP.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP -->
   reasonable to continue complete course for atypical organisms.  Now
   with concern for VAP(green purulent sputum by BAL) --> plan targetd
   antimicorbials.  Continue Vanco, Meropenim, Doxicycline.
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema, possibly related to
   underlying process or related to medications.  Improving.  Continue
   steroids.
   PNEUMONIA / ARDS / respiratory failure
 micro remain unrevealing,
   continue current abx regimen, wean vent as tolerated
 decrease RR and
   FiO2 today.  Meropenim, Vanco, Doxicycline per ID service.
   HYPOTENSION -- follow BP, diurese as tolerated.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.  Now vaginal bleeding (minimal).
   VAGINAL BLEEDING
 resolved.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 monitor.  [**Month (only) 11**] need free water replacement.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well. The patient has a history of allergies to atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin. They are currently receiving multiple medications including sedatives, analgesics, antibiotics, and diuretics. The patient has anemia and hypernatremia, and their nutritional support is being provided through tube feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): This is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period. It is caused by the colonization of the endotracheal tube by bacteria, leading to infection.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels indicate a potential risk for AKI. This can be caused by various factors such as hypotension, dehydration, or medications.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach due to increased gastric acid production. Prophylactic medications are being given to prevent this complication.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs (DVT),"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, CAP of unclear etiology, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia,
   possible ARDS.  Now possible VAP.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.  Treat oral swelling.  Begin tapering
   sedation as tolerated.  Weaning PEEP.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP -->
   reasonable to continue complete course for atypical organisms.  Now
   with concern for VAP(green purulent sputum by BAL) --> plan targetd
   antimicorbials.  Continue Vanco, Meropenim, Doxicycline.
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema, possibly related to
   underlying process or related to medications.  Improving.  Continue
   steroids.
   PNEUMONIA / ARDS / respiratory failure
 micro remain unrevealing,
   continue current abx regimen, wean vent as tolerated
 decrease RR and
   FiO2 today.  Meropenim, Vanco, Doxicycline per ID service.
   HYPOTENSION -- follow BP, diurese as tolerated.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.  Now vaginal bleeding (minimal).
   VAGINAL BLEEDING
 resolved.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 monitor.  [**Month (only) 11**] need free water replacement.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, unclear etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with ongoing efforts to wean off the ventilator. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline. Oral mucosal swelling is improving, and steroids have been tapered. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and fluids are being managed to achieve a net negative balance. The patient also has anemia and hypernatremia, which require further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's condition may worsen if VAP develops, leading to a worsening respiratory status and potential sepsis.
2. Fluid overload: Insufficient fluid management could lead to fluid overload, compromising respiratory function and potentially causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for additional infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and indwelling lines.
4. Hypotension: Persistent hypotension may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and could lead to organ dysfunction.
5. Anemia: Severe anemia can contribute to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, potentially worsening the patient's overall condition.
6. Hypernatremia: Elevated sodium levels may disrupt cellular function and contribute to neurological complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and fevers, which are likely due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. Other possible etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia, and autoimmune diseases have been ruled out through various tests. The patient has also been treated for suspected Mycoplasma, chlamydia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), all of which were negative. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed polys but no organism, with 1% eosinophils. Viral and Legionella tests were also negative. Sputum culture showed yeast, and urine histopathology was negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity: No further information provided.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient continues to have respiratory distress and fevers. Further investigations are needed to identify the cause of multi-focal pneumonia.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: No further information provided.
4. Headache: No further information provided"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress/fevers likely due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. Other possible etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia, and autoimmune workup have been negative. She has received various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, and doxycycline. The patient appears to be doing well with vent weaning but continues to have fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may develop pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility and pressure on certain areas of the body.
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress could progress to acute respiratory failure if she is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient may develop decreased urine output or complete absence of urine production, which can indicate kidney dysfunction or failure.
4. Headache: The patient may experience"

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia. She has multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray and respiratory distress. The patient's fever continues, and she has been treated with various antibiotics. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Her sedation is being weaned off, and she is tolerating a PaO2 of 60. The patient's allergies include atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged immobility, pressure from medical devices, or decreased perfusion.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not identified and treated appropriately.
3. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's urine output is decreased, which can indicate kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
4. Headache: The patient reports headaches, which may be related to increased intracranial pressure, medication side effects, or other underlying causes.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was admitted to the ICU with complaints of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She presented with hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's initial assessment included respiratory distress/fevers likely due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. The differential diagnosis included less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia, and autoimmune workup negative.

She has been treated with various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. Other medications include meropenem, vancomycin, famotidine, heparin sodium, and sertraline.

The patient's current conditions include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute), oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia (other), nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure (acute), and fever (hypothermia). She also has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous NSTEMI.

The plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, lowering P"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, oliguria/anuria, headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, fever, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's respiratory distress and fevers are likely due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause, with less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia also considered.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. The patient's condition has not improved, and further investigations are pending, including urine Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen, Legionella, and LCMV.

The patient's current plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, lowering PEEP, maintaining FiO2 at 50%, decreasing sedation gradually, diuresis with lasix, and monitoring for fever of unknown origin. The patient's lines should be assessed, and the femoral line should be discontinued"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, CAP of unclear etiology, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia,
   possible ARDS.  Now possible VAP.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.  Treat oral swelling. Taper sedation
   as tolerated.  Continue weaning PEEP towards 5 cmH2O.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP -->
   reasonable to continue complete course for atypical organisms.
   VAP(green purulent sputum by BAL) --> plan targetd antimicorbials.
   Continue Vanco, Meropenim, Doxicycline.
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema, possibly related to
   underlying process or related to medications.  Improving.  Continue
   steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor, diurese as tolerated.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea/vomiting, and hypoxia. On examination, she had multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray and was found to have respiratory distress/fevers likely due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The cause of her symptoms remains unknown.

She has been treated with various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. The antibiotic regimen was changed due to a concern about drug reaction. Tests for common pathogens such as Mycoplasma and chlamydia were negative, and she also tested negative for HIV. BAL with polys revealed no organism, and there were only yeast present in the sputum. Viral and Legionella tests were also negative.

Other conditions include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia (other), nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure, fever, and depression/anxiety. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
- Heart rate: 67 bpm
- Blood pressure: 137/65 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was intubated on day 11 due to respiratory distress and fevers.

The patient's current conditions include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome), oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia (other), nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, renal failure (acute), fever (hypothermia), and multiple other comorbidities.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Multi-focal pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest multi-focal pneumonia. It is important to continue the current antibiotic regimen and perform further diagnostic tests such as sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures to identify the causative organism.

2. Drug reaction: The patient's face swelling resolved after discontinuing Linezolid, suggesting a possible drug reaction. It is necessary to monitor for any other signs of drug reactions and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.

3. Renal failure: The patient has oliguria/anuria, which may indicate acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are required.

4. Fever"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, CAP of unclear etiology, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating improvement.
   Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Now possible VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Treat oral swelling. Taper sedation as tolerated.  Continue weaning
   PEEP towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Work towards SBT.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP -->
   reasonable to continue complete course for atypical organisms.
   VAP(green purulent sputum by BAL) --> plan targetd antimicorbials.
   Continue Vanco, Meropenim, Doxicycline.
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema, possibly related to
   underlying process or related to medications.  Improved.  Continue
   steroids.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Monitor, diurese as tolerated.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- continue weaning.  Will substitute with Propofol to allow
   daily wake-ups (d/c versed)
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   Overall Tmax on decline.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia of unclear etiology, possibly leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are concerns for oral mucosal swelling, hypotension, bacteremia, and fluid balance. The patient has been diagnosed with NIDDM and anemia. Nutritional support is being provided through tube feeding. The patient's condition is slowly improving, but they remain critically ill. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining good oral hygiene, elevating the head of the bed, and regularly assessing and changing the endotracheal tube if necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation may be needed to prevent this complication.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be used to prevent these ulcers.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within normal limits, but there is a risk of developing hypotension due to se"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She was admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia. She had multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray and respiratory distress, which likely indicates multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. 

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and meropenem. Her clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off ventilation.

The patient also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia (other), nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin).

She has a history of anemia, transaminitis, hypertension, NSTEMI, depression/anxiety, diabetes mellitus, and face swelling (resolved after cessation of linezolid). 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 102/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and central venous pressure of 11 mmHg.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. The patient was admitted with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia. She also had multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient was intubated on day 12 due to respiratory distress and fevers. The cause of respiratory distress and fevers is still unknown, despite extensive workup including autoimmune and infectious evaluations. The patient received multiple antibiotics (ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin) and oseltamivir. The antibiotics were changed due to concern about drug reaction. The chest X-ray shows little interval change, with persistence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. She experienced a failed spontaneous breathing trial due to diaphoresis and tachypnea, which could be attributed to increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, and mild drug withdrawal.

The patient is currently receiving meropenem, vancomycin, and doxycycline for 8-day courses. She is also on fentanyl and propofol sedation, which will be tapered as tolerated. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, decrease PEEP to 8, and start anxiolytic medication. Blood"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was admitted to the ICU with complaints of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory distress/fevers likely due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. Other possible causes such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, Babesia have been ruled out. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, and meropenem.

The patient also has impaired skin integrity, oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. The fever curve has improved, and the patient is no longer requiring a cooling blanket. However, the cause of the fever remains unknown.

The patient has face swelling, which resolved after cessation of Linezolid, and the etiology is unclear. There is a possibility of angioedema secondary to drug reaction. The patient's anemia is stabilized and likely dilutional. The patient also has transient elevated liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the ICU with complaints of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. Firstly, she developed respiratory failure and required intubation on day 11. The cause of her respiratory distress and fevers is suspected to be multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, with less common etiologies such as Histoplasma, Ehrlichia, Coxiella, and Babesia being considered. Autoimmune workup and HIV tests have been negative. She has received various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, and meropenem.

Secondly, the patient has oliguria/anuria, which means decreased urine output. This can be a sign of kidney dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

Thirdly, she complains of headaches, which may be related to her overall medical condition or possibly due to increased intracranial pressure.

Fourthly, she has pneumonia of unknown etiology, treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her infectious disease workup is ongoing, including blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, CAP of unclear etiology, ARDS.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Now possible
   VAP.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2
   >90%. Oral swelling Taper sedation as tolerated.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Work towards SBT.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP -->
   reasonable to continue complete course for atypical organisms.
   VAP(green purulent sputum by BAL) --> plan targetd antimicorbials.
   Continue Vanco, Meropenim, Doxicycline.
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema, possibly related to
   underlying process or related to medications.  Improved.  Steroids -->
   d/c.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- continue weaning.  Will substitute with Propofol to allow
   daily wake-ups (d/c versed).  Change Fentanyl infusion to iv bolus.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   Overall Tmax on decline.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- critical care mypathy.  PT consult.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and currently intubated in the ICU. The main concern is respiratory failure, which is attributed to LLL (likely lower left lobe) pneumonia and possible ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient has shown daily improvement, but still requires mechanical ventilation. The target for ventilation is to maintain a pH of 7.35-7.40 and SaO2 greater than 90%. Sedation should be tapered as tolerated, and PEEP should be weaned towards 5 cmH2O. Monitoring of VBG (venous blood gas) and SaO2 is important, and the goal is to work towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

The pneumonia's etiology is unclear, but a complete course of antibiotics for atypical organisms should be continued. Additionally, targeted antimicrobials are planned due to green purulent sputum found during bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The current antibiotics include Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Doxycycline.

There is concern for oral mucosal swelling, possibly related to angioedema or medication. This has improved, and steroids have been discontinued.

The patient also has bacteremia caused by GPC (Gram-positive cocci), which is suspected to be line-related. Therefore, Vancomycin should be continued, and lines may need to be resighted or discontinued.

Fluid balance is a concern, aiming for a net negative balance. Monitoring I/O (input"

The patient has a history of allergies to Atorvastatin, Ibuprofen, and Levofloxacin. The patient was started on lorazepam 1mg q 4hrs PRN for anxiety and underwent a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) in the morning, followed by transition to tube feeds. The dose of vancomycin was held in the evening due to high trough levels.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including propofol at 50 mcg/kg/min, fentanyl, midazolam (versed), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include lorazepam.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/71 to 90/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 360 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI who presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia. The patient was found to have multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient has been intubated for 13 days and has shown improvement in clinical status. 

The patient's respiratory distress and fevers are likely due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. Autoimmune workup and extensive infectious workup have been negative. The patient has received ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, and oseltamivir without improvement. The patient's antibiotics were changed due to concerns about drug reaction. The chest X-ray shows little interval change with persistence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. 

The patient is being weaned off the ventilator and is expected to attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) again this evening if the respiratory system bilinear index (RSBI) is less than 105. The patient will continue to receive weaning trials as tolerated. 

The patient's nausea and vomiting are likely due to medication side effects or prolonged intubation. The patient will be tapered off fentanyl and propofol as tolerated, and lorazepam will be given for anxiety.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of pneumonia, respiratory distress, and fever. The patient had been experiencing fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea before admission.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly since intubation on day 13. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 360 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 110. Her respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is deferred due to agitation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate (HR) of 69 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 115/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. Her central venous pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was admitted with symptoms of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient was intubated on day 12 due to respiratory distress and fevers. The cause of her respiratory distress and fevers is suspected to be multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, of unknown cause. She has been treated with various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and most recently meropenem. The antibiotics were changed due to concern about drug reaction. Her chest X-ray shows little interval change, persistence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. A spontaneous breathing trial failed due to diaphoresis and tachypnea, which is likely multifactorial. She is now on continuous mechanical ventilation, and the plan is to decrease PEEP to 8 as the patient is less sedated and wants the most comfortable vent setting while adequately ventilating and oxygenating.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was intubated on day 13 due to respiratory distress and fevers. Initial workup for autoimmune and infectious causes was negative. Antibiotics were changed due to concern about drug reaction. The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. She failed a spontaneous breathing test likely due to increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, and mild drug withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient is sedated and intubated, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and multi-focal pneumonia may lead to further deterioration of respiratory function.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is decreased, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
4. Headache: The patient complains of headaches, which could be related to increased intracranial pressure or other neurological issues.
5. Pneumonia, other: Despite treatment, the patient still has persistent pneumonia of unknown etiology.
6. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's gastrointestinal"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Also VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Oral swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component
   of anxiety and profound motor weakness.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP, followed
   by complication of VAP --> completed antimicrobials today. (Vanco,
   Meropenim, Doxicycline).
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema.  Resolved.  Steroids
   --> d/c.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related --> completed Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- Now on standing ativan doses and Propofol infusion.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   Overall Tmax on decline.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- critical care mypathy.  PT consult.

","The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is attributed to lower lobe pneumonia and possible ARDS, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has shown improvement, tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for more than 60 minutes but exhibits anxiety and profound motor weakness.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin. They have been on various antibiotics since May 27th, including vancomycin, doxycycline, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate between 66-83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/56 to 115/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg, and fluid balance is negative 563 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and lactate. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient has completed antimicrobials for pneumonia, including vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has been tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for more than 60 minutes but exhibits anxiety and profound motor weakness, limiting progress. There is a concern for tracheotomy tube placement. The patient has a history of pneumonia with unclear etiology, initially presenting as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and later complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). All antimicrobials have been completed. Oral mucosal swelling, possibly angioedema, has resolved. The patient had bacteremia due to GPC, suspected to be line-related, and the line has been changed. Fluid balance is desired to be net negative. Sedation is being weaned with the use of lorazepam and propofol infusion. Liver function tests (LFT) are slowly improving. The patient has had a fever, possibly drug-related, but overall temperature is on decline. Anemia is present and requires transfusion as needed. The patient has a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and will continue insulin therapy to maintain glucose levels below 150. Nutritional support through tube feeding (TF) at goal is ongoing. Generalized weakness, possibly critical care myopathy, is suspected, and a physical therapy consult has been made.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Also VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Oral swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component
   of anxiety and profound motor weakness limiting progress.  Will
   initiate evaluation for tracheotomy tube placement.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP, followed
   by complication of VAP --> completed antimicrobials today. (Vanco,
   Meropenim, Doxicycline).
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- concern for angioedema.  Resolved.  Steroids
   --> d/c.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related --> completed Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- Now on standing ativan doses and Propofol infusion.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 unclear [**Name2 (NI) **], but may be component of drug-related fever.
   Overall Tmax on decline.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- critical care mypathy.  PT consult.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to persistent respiratory failure attributed to lower left lobe pneumonia and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's oral mucosal swelling has resolved, and they have completed antimicrobials for suspected line-related bacteremia, unclear etiology of initial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and VAP.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's glucose levels need to be monitored while on steroids, and insulin should be continued to maintain glucose below 150. The patient's generalized weakness is critical care myopathy, and a physical therapy consult has been requested.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/56 mmHg to 115/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg, and their fluid balance is negative by 563 mL since 12 AM.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include worsening respiratory failure, further development of ARDS, VAP, line-related bacteremia, and complications associated with the generalized weakness and an"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was intubated on day 13 due to respiratory distress and fevers. The cause of her respiratory distress and fevers remains unknown. Extensive infectious workup and autoimmune workup have been negative. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, and oseltamivir.

The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. However, she failed a spontaneous breathing trial due to diaphoresis and tachypnea, likely multifactorial due to increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, and some mild drug withdrawal. The patient's allergies include atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin. She is currently on multiple medications, including propofol, lorazepam (Ativan), and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 108/"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She was admitted with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient had hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient was intubated on day 14 due to respiratory distress and fevers. Fevers resolved, and an autoimmune workup was negative. Extensive infectious workup was also negative, and the patient received antibiotics, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. The chest X-ray showed little interval change, with persistence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

Clinical status has improved significantly, and the patient is being weaned off the ventilator. However, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failed on 05/29 due to tachypnea, which is likely multifactorial.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient was intubated on day 14 due to respiratory distress and fevers. The cause of the respiratory distress and fevers remains unknown despite extensive workup, including autoimmune and infectious evaluations. She received ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. Antibiotic therapy was changed due to concern about drug reaction.

The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. She is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and is receiving nutrition via a multi-lumen central line.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and fever.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. tracheostomy infection
3. central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
4. catheter-related urinary tract"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Also VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Oral swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component
   of anxiety, abnormal lung parencyhyma and profound motor weakness
   limiting progress.  Will initiate evaluation for tracheotomy tube
   placement, but will continue to work towards extubation trial if
   possible.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP, followed
   by complication of VAP --> completed antimicrobials today. (Vanco,
   Meropenim, Doxicycline).
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- angioedema.  Resolved.  Steroids --> d/c.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related --> completed Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- Now on standing ativan doses and Propofol infusion.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 resolved.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- critical care mypathy.  PT consult.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, attributed to LLL pneumonia and possible ARDS. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's motor strength has improved today, with the ability to squeeze hands and move feet and legs. Oral mucosal swelling has resolved, and the patient has completed antimicrobials for pneumonia. There is a suspicion of line-related bacteremia, which has been treated with vancomycin. Fluid balance is desired to be net negative, and sedation has been tapered. LFT elevation is slowly improving, and the patient's fever has resolved. Anemia, NIDDM, and nutritional support are being monitored and managed accordingly. Generalized weakness is attributed to critical care myopathy, and a PT consult has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's persistent respiratory failure and improvement in daily basis indicate a possibility of VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and respiratory status is necessary.

2. Line-related bacteremia: The suspicion of line-related bacteremia requires assessment of the patient's lines, and appropriate measures such as resighting or discontinuation may be needed.

3. Fluid overload: The patient's current fluid balance indicates a desire for a net negative balance. Monitoring of I/O and aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters for the next 24 hours is essential to prevent fluid overload.

4. Critical care"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Also VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Oral swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component
   of anxiety, abnormal lung parencyhyma and profound motor weakness
   limiting progress.  Will initiate evaluation for tracheotomy tube
   placement, but will continue to work towards extubation trial if
   possible.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP, followed
   by complication of VAP --> completed antimicrobials today. (Vanco,
   Meropenim, Doxicycline).
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- angioedema.  Resolved.  Steroids --> d/c.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related --> completed Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- Now on standing ativan doses and Propofol infusion.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 resolved.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- critical care mypathy.  PT consult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, attributed to lower left lobe pneumonia and possible ARDS, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There has been daily improvement, but motor weakness and anxiety during spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) have limited progress. Evaluation for tracheotomy tube placement is being initiated. Oral mucosal swelling due to angioedema has resolved. Bacteremia caused by GPC is suspected to be line-related and has been treated with vancomycin. Fluid balance is desired to be negative, and lines may need to be resighted or discontinued. Sedation is being tapered, and nutritional support is ongoing. Generalized weakness, potentially due to critical care myopathy, is being evaluated by physical therapy (PT). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which is attributed to LLL pneumonia and possible ARDS, as well as VAP. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating that they are dependent on the ventilator to breathe.
2. Motor Weakness: The patient's profound motor weakness is limiting progress in weaning off the ventilator. This weakness may be due to critical care myopathy, and PT consultation has been made to evaluate and manage this issue.
3. Anxiety: The patient exhibits"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea/vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was intubated on day 14 due to respiratory distress and fevers. The cause of her respiratory distress/fevers was initially thought to be multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, but after extensive infectious workup, it remained of unknown cause. She received broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications without improvement. Her clinical status improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. However, she failed a spontaneous breathing trial due to tachypnea, which may be due to increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, and drug withdrawal. The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, oliguria/anuria, headache, pneumonia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and anemia."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient was intubated on day 14 due to respiratory distress and fevers. The cause of the respiratory distress and fevers is still unknown, and extensive infectious workup has been negative. She received various antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline.

The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. However, she failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) on 5/29 due to tachypnea, which is likely multifactorial. The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with multi-focal pneumonia, and there is still persistence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening respiratory symptoms or new infiltrates.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for two weeks, there is a risk of developing VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Also VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Oral swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component
   of anxiety, abnormal lung parencyhyma and profound motor weakness
   limiting progress.  Will initiate evaluation for tracheotomy tube
   placement, but will continue to work towards extubation trial if
   possible.  Anxiety and motor weakness remains major obstacles to
   adequate SBT.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP, followed
   by complication of VAP --> completed antimicrobials today. (Vanco,
   Meropenim, Doxicycline).
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- angioedema.  Resolved.  Steroids --> d/c.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related --> completed Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- Now on standing ativan doses and Propofol infusion.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 resolved.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- critical care mypathy.  PT consult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, attributed to LLL pneumonia and possible ARDS. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. They have shown daily improvement but still demonstrate persistent respiratory failure. The patient has undergone prolonged sedation, which has been tapered. Oral mucosal swelling has resolved, and the patient has completed antimicrobials for pneumonia. There is a suspicion of line-related bacteremia, which has been treated. Fluid balance is desired to be negative, and nutritional support is being provided through tube feeds. The patient also has generalized weakness, likely due to critical care myopathy, and is under the care of a physical therapist. The patient's condition is closely monitored, and various interventions are being implemented to manage their critical illness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia, possibly as a complication of mechanical ventilation. Monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment will be crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure could be due to ARDS, which is a severe lung condition. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
3. Bacteremia: Although the line-related bacteremia seems to have been treated, continuous monitoring for signs of infection and sepsis is important.
4. Critical care myopathy: The patient's generalized weakness could be attributed to critical care myopathy. Physical therapy and appropriate management are necessary to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Also VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Oral swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component
   of anxiety, abnormal lung parencyhyma and profound motor weakness
   limiting progress.    Anxiety and motor weakness remains major
   obstacles to adequate SBT.  Plan for tracheotomy tube placement.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP, followed
   by complication of VAP --> completed antimicrobials today. (Vanco,
   Meropenim, Doxicycline).
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- angioedema.  Resolved.  Steroids --> d/c.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related --> completed Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- Now on standing ativan doses and Propofol infusion.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 resolved.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- critical care mypathy.  PT consult.

- The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- The patient was intubated on day 14 due to respiratory distress and fevers. The fevers have resolved, and an autoimmune workup was negative.
- Extensive infectious workup was also negative, and she received various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline.
- The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. She will have a tracheostomy planned for the next day.
- The patient's fever of unknown origin has resolved, and there is no evidence of autoimmune disease or malignancy.
- There are some potential medical complications that can arise, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is suspected due to an increase in white blood cell count and the presence of oropharyngeal secretions. However, the patient is not more dyspneic and remains afebr"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a multi-lobular pneumonia patient who is currently intubated. The patient remains bradycardic but hemodynamically stable. They have been receiving 85 cc/hr D5NS for maintenance fluids and nutrition. An internal jugular (IJ) line was pulled, and a new rash appeared. The patient underwent tracheostomy today.

The patient has allergies to atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin, with reported side effects of nausea/vomiting and hives. The last dose of antibiotics administered was meropenem on 05/28/2170 at 07:47 AM.

The patient is currently receiving propofol at a dose of 40 mcg/kg/min for sedation, along with lansoprazole (Prevacid) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) as ICU medications. Other medications include unspecified changes to medical and family history.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new rash. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 85 bpm with a normal range of 71-101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/55 mmHg to 151/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a normal range of 13-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was admitted with symptoms of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory distress and fevers, which were initially suspected to be due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. However, extensive infectious workup was negative, and autoimmune workup was also negative. The patient received antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. The antibiotics were changed due to concerns about drug reaction.

The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. A tracheostomy is planned for tomorrow. The patient is also experiencing nausea and vomiting, which could be related to prolonged intubation, anxiety, or drug withdrawal. The patient's fever has resolved.

Other potential medical complications mentioned in the note include impaired balance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired transfers, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), oliguria"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia. The patient was found to have multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray and diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia of unknown cause. 

The patient's respiratory distress and fevers resolved after being intubated on day 15. An autoimmune workup was negative, and extensive infectious workup did not reveal any positive findings. She was treated with various antibiotics, antiviral medication, and doxycycline. The patient's clinical status improved significantly, and she is now going for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to failing spontaneous breathing tests (SBT).

The patient's tachypnea is likely multifactorial, including increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, and some mild drug withdrawal. Ventilator management will continue on volume assist until tracheostomy today. Propofol will be tapered as tolerated, and ativan will be given as needed for anxiety.

A new macular erythematous rash has appeared, which is concerning for heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. The distribution seems consistent with a heat rash, especially"

   - continue to taper propofol as tolerated, ativan prn axiety
   - f/u studies, reculture if spikes

   #Persistent Fever of Unknown Origin: Currently.  No evidence for
   autoimmune disease or malignancy at this point.  Multifocal PNA of
   unknown etiology treated with broad coverage abx, course completed.
   Possibility that drug side effect given the amount of abx pt is on.
   Rheumatic work up to date is negative (ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **]/RF/c3/c4).  No evidence

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She was intubated on day 15 due to respiratory distress and fevers. The cause of her symptoms was initially suspected to be multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, but it was of unknown origin. Extensive infectious workup and autoimmune workup were negative. She received multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. Her clinical status improved significantly, and she is now going for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She has shown improvement in her respiratory distress and fevers but still has tachypnea, which is likely multifactorial due to increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, and some mild drug withdrawal. She is being weaned off propofol and given ativan for anxiety. Her blood cultures are being monitored, and she is continuing to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also has persistent fever of unknown origin, with no evidence of autoimmune disease or malignancy. A rhe"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Also VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Oral swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component
   of anxiety, abnormal lung parencyhyma and profound motor weakness
   limiting progress.    Anxiety and motor weakness remains major
   obstacles to adequate SBT.  Plan for tracheotomy tube placement.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP, followed
   by complication of VAP --> completed antimicrobials today. (Vanco,
   Meropenim, Doxicycline).
   ORAL MUCOSAL SWELLING -- angioedema.  Resolved.  Steroids --> d/c.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related --> completed Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- Now on standing ativan doses and Propofol infusion.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 resolved.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to generalized motor weakness without significant change. A new rash (maculopapular) is observed over the left neck and upper back. The patient's allergies include atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (with a range of 71-101 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 151/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (with a range of 16-39 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has decreased from 98 kg at admission to 69.2 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 13.2-13.6 K/uL, hematocrit level of 29.9-30.0%, platelet count of 628-769 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.4-0.5 mg/dL, and glucose level of 89-105 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical history is significant for respiratory failure attributed to LLL pneumonia and possible ARDS, as well as VAP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which is attributed to left lower lobe pneumonia and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's generalized motor weakness persists without significant change. A new maculopapular rash has appeared over the left neck and upper back. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 151/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

The patient has a history of allergies to atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and levofloxacin. Infusions include propofol at 40 mcg/kg/min, and other medications include lansoprazole and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of a rash. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and tube feeds through a feeding tube.

Physical examination findings include a trace amount of edema in both lower extremities, warm skin with a maculopapular erythematous rash over the left neck and upper back,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia. The patient was intubated on day 15 due to respiratory distress and fevers. After extensive workup, the cause of her fevers and multi-focal pneumonia remained unknown. She was treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. The patient's clinical status improved significantly, and she underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's current medications include propofol, fentanyl, morphine sulfate, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, ASA, statin, sertraline, and ativan. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 125/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient remains sedated and unresponsive.

Physical examination findings include a supple neck, no jugular venous distention or liver enlargement, regular heart rhythm, and course breath sounds"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and hypoxia, and was found to have multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient underwent tracheostomy on [**2170-5-31**] and is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's respiratory distress and fevers resolved after the tracheostomy, but she still requires ventilatory support. The cause of her respiratory distress and fevers remains unknown despite extensive infectious workup and antibiotic treatment. The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, and she is scheduled for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) as she failed spontaneous breathing trials.

The patient also has a new rash, which is stable and not progressing. It is concerning for heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. The distribution seems consistent with a heat rash, especially in the context of diaphoresis and uncontrolled secretions. However, it cannot be ruled out as a drug reaction given the patient's history of drug reaction and recent antibiotic treatment. Dermatology consultation is being followed, and the patient is applying miconazole/hydrocortisone cream as needed.

The patient's persistent fever of unknown origin has resolved for three days. No evidence"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to pneumonia, ARDS.  Also VAP.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%. Oral
   swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP towards 5
   cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component of
   anxiety, abnormal lung parencyhyma and profound motor weakness limiting
   progress.    Anxiety and motor weakness remains major obstacles to
   adequate SBT.  Plan for tracheotomy tube placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 112/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including percutaneous tracheostomy, administration of antibiotics (Vanco, Meropenem, Doxycycline), and completion of antimicrobials. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, but there are some abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT/AST), kidney function (creatinine), and electrolytes (sodium, potassium).

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory failure is persistent but showing daily improvement. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation with the goal of maintaining a pH of 7.35-7.40 and oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) but is limited by anxiety, abnormal lung parenchyma, and profound motor weakness. Tracheostomy tube placement is planned.

The patient also has pneumonia, with an unclear etiology, which has progressed to V"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS.  Also VAP.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%.
   Oral swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Continue weaning PEEP
   towards 5 cmH2O.  Monitor VBG and SaO2.  Tolerating SBT, but component
   of anxiety, abnormal lung parencyhyma and profound motor weakness
   limiting progress.    Anxiety and motor weakness remains major
   obstacles to adequate SBT.  Plan for tracheotomy tube placement.
   PNEUMONIA -- unclear etiology of initial presentation of CAP, followed
   by complication of VAP --> completed antimicrobials today. (Vanco,
   Meropenim, Doxicycline).
   RASH
 concern for drug rash (although asymmetric) or contact
   dermatitis.  Consider Dermatology evaluation.  Monitor.  Local care.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC.  Suspect line-related --> completed Vanco.  Assess
   lines, may require resighting or discontinuation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.  Aim for net
   negative 1-2 litres for next 24 hrs.
   SEDATION -- Now on standing ativan doses and Propofol infusion.
   LFT ELEVATION
 slowly improving.  Monitor.
   FEVER
 resolved.
   ANEMIA -- repeat, transfuse as needed.
   NIDDM
 monitor glucose while on steroids, continue insulin.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF at goal.  On hold for trach.  Will
   need PEG (either percutaneous or surgical).
   GENERALIZED WEAKNESS -- critical care mypathy.  PT consult.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, possible ARDS, and VAP. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Oral swelling has resolved, and sedation has been tapered. The patient is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) but is limited by anxiety, abnormal lung parenchyma, and profound motor weakness. The patient has completed antimicrobials for pneumonia, and a rash is present, which may be a drug rash or contact dermatitis. There is concern for line-related bacteremia, which has been treated with vancomycin. The patient's fluid balance needs to be managed to achieve a net negative balance. Sedation has been reduced, and the patient is now standing with the help of Ativan and Propofol infusion. Liver function tests (LFTs) are slowly improving. Fever has resolved. The patient has anemia, NIDDM, and requires nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TF) and possibly percutaneous or surgical enteral nutrition (PEG). Generalized weakness may be due to critical care myopathy, and a physical therapy (PT) consult has been requested. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to LLL pneumonia, possible ARDS, and VAP. Continued mechanical ventilation is necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's initial etiology of respiratory distress/fevers was likely multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. Her fever resolved after receiving ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. The antibiotic regimen was changed due to concerns about drug reaction.

The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, but she repeatedly fails spontaneous breathing tests (SBT) likely due to increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, some mild drug withdrawal, and decreased lung compliance from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off sedation to attempt a pressure support of 10/5. She is also being weaned off propofol.

The patient developed a new rash, which is stable and not progressing. It is macular erythematous and could be a heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. The distribution seems consistent with a heat rash, especially in the context of diaphoresis and uncontrolled secretions. However, the appearance is less consistent with a fungal infection. The patient will be followed by a dermatology consult, and miconazole/hydrocortisone cream will be used as needed.

The patient's persistent fever of unknown origin has resolved for the past three days. No evidence of autoimmune disease or malignancy has been found. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the possibility of drug side effects is being considered. A rheumatic workup is negative, and there is no evidence of deep space infection based on CT scans of the sinuses and abdomen/pelvis. The patient had a previous positive culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a central line bottle, but no repeat positive culture has been detected.

There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but the patient does not exhibit dyspnea or fever, and the chest X-ray shows little interval change. Therefore, there is no indication for empiric antibiotics at this time. The patient's secretions are likely oropharyngeal but may indicate early VAP. Suctioning of secretions will be done as needed, and the use of scopolamine will be avoided due to CNS effects.

The patient previously had facial edema, which resolved after cessation of Linezolid. The etiology of the facial edema is unclear, and a completed steroid course was given. The patient's anemia has stabilized and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 118/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator.

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, blood glucose level ranging from 89-112 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and sodium level of 139 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general appearance, heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, or skin. Neurological examination shows normal strength, reflexes, and coordination. 

The patient's medical conditions include pain, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, diarrhea, fever, and possibly a stress ulcer. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, infection due to impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulcers, and potential antibiotic-associated allergies or side effects. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical condition is crucial"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She underwent tracheostomy and was placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress/fevers of unknown cause. 

The patient's condition improved significantly after receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications. However, she developed a new rash, which is macular erythematous and could be a heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. Dermatology consult was ordered, and she was treated with miconazole/hydrocortisone cream as needed.

The patient also had persistent fever of unknown origin, which resolved after completing the course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Rheumatic workup, including ANCA, RF, complement levels, was negative, and there were no signs of deep space infection on CT sinus or CT abdomen/pelvis.

She had secretions, likely oropharyngeal, but potential early indication of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, her CXR showed little interval change, and she remained afebrile, so no indication for empiric antibiotics was given.

The patient experienced facial edema, which resolved after cessation of Linezolid. It was unclear whether it"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), anxiety, diabetes mellitus type 2 (NIDDM), anemia, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 118/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 353 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), with normal platelet count and kidney function. The patient's recent events include nausea/vomiting with ibuprofen and heparin sodium, hives with levofloxacin, and a rash that received local care. The patient's current medications include propofol, heparin sodium, atorvastatin, insulin, and H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation to maintain pH between 7.35-7.40"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia, ARDS, and VAP. They are currently on mechanical ventilation to maintain a pH level of 7.35-7.40 and SaO2 >90%. Oral swelling has resolved, and sedation has been tapered. The plan is to continue weaning PEEP towards 5 cmH2O and monitor vital signs and SaO2. The patient is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) but is limited by anxiety, abnormal lung parenchyma, and profound motor weakness. A tracheotomy tube placement is planned to aid in the SBT process and convert to pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient initially presented with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) which later complicated into ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Antimicrobials have been completed for both infections.

The patient also had a rash that required local care, bacteremia caused by GPC suspected to be line-related, which was treated with Vancomycin. Lines may need resighting or discontinuation.

Other medical conditions include anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient will be monitored, and transfusions will be given as needed for anemia. Insulin will be continued to manage NIDDM, maintaining glucose levels below 150.

The patient is also being monitored for generalized weakness"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to pneumonia, ARDS, and VAP. He has been on mechanical ventilation and is showing daily improvement. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 118/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has decreased from 98 kg to 69.2 kg since admission. He has received various medications, including propofol, heparin sodium, and antibiotics. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. His electrolytes are within normal range, with a slight elevation in potassium and magnesium levels. His renal function tests indicate a decreased creatinine level. Other lab results, including liver enzymes, blood glucose, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

Plan:
The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia, ARDS, and VAP. He will continue to be mechanically ventilated with the aim of maintaining a pH of 7.35-7.40 and SaO2 >90%. PEEP will be weaned towards 5 cmH2O, and the patient will be monitored for VBG and SaO2. Tracheotomy tube placement is planned due to the patient's anxiety and profound motor weakness"

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, but now demonstrating daily
   improvement.  Attributed to pneumonia, ARDS.  Also VAP.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Aim for pH= 7.35-7.40, SaO2 >90%. Oral
   swelling resolved.  Sedation tapered.  Monitor VBG and SaO2. Rapid
   shallow breathing related to late stage ARDS and motor weakness
   limiting progress.  Anxiety and motor weakness remains major obstacles
   to adequate SBT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). They are on mechanical ventilation and showing daily improvement.
- The patient also has anxiety and motor weakness, which are major obstacles to successful spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).
- Other conditions include unclear etiology of initial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), followed by VAP, which has been treated with completed antimicrobials. The patient also has a rash, fever (resolved), coronary artery disease (CAD), anemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
- The patient is diagnosed with critical care myopathy and is expected to undergo physical therapy in the future.
- The patient's nutritional status is replete with fiber, and their glycemic control is being maintained below 150.
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed VAP as a complication of mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent further respiratory infections.
   - Barotrauma: The high pressures from mechanical ventilation can lead to barotrauma, which is damage to the lung tissue due to overdistension. Monitoring airway pressures"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. The patient underwent tracheostomy on day 2.

The patient's respiratory distress and fevers initially were thought to be due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. However, after extensive infectious workup and negative autoimmune workup, the fevers resolved. The patient received antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. The antibiotics were changed on day 18 due to concern about drug reaction. Despite the persistence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, the patient's clinical status has improved significantly.

The patient experienced new-onset rash, which is macular erythematous and not progressing. It is concerning for heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. However, the distribution seems consistent with a heat rash, especially considering the diaphoresis and uncontrolled secretions. The patient is being followed by a dermatology consult and is using miconazole/hydrocortisone cream as needed.

The patient also had persistent fever of unknown origin, which has now resolved for three days. There is no evidence of autoimmune disease or malignancy at this point. The possibility of a drug side effect is being considered given the amount of antibiotics the patient is on. The rheumatic workup is up to date and negative.

There were concerns about potential early ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increased white blood cell count and oropharyngeal secretions. However, the patient remains afebrile and not more dyspneic, with little interval change on chest X-ray. Therefore, empiric antibiotics for VAP are not indicated at this time.

The patient also had facial edema, which resolved after cessation of linezolid. The etiology of the edema remains unclear. The patient's anemia is stable and likely dilutional. Transaminitis continues to improve, and the patient is being monitored for any clinical indications. The patient's hypertension and history of NSTEMI are stable, and she will continue on home metoprolol and statin therapy.

The patient is being treated for depression/anxiety with sertraline and increased ativan dosage. A social work consult has been arranged for patient coping skills, and supportive psychotherapy will be continued via nursing and physician support.

The patient's diabetes mellitus is stable, and she will continue with HISS (insulin infusion system) and glarg"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented to the ICU with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient underwent tracheostomy on day 2 and initially had respiratory distress/fevers. The etiology of her respiratory distress/fevers was likely multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and doxycycline. The antibiotics were changed on day 13 due to concern about drug reaction. Her clinical status improved significantly, but she repeatedly failed spontaneous breathing tests (SBT), likely due to increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, some mild drug withdrawal, and decreased lung compliance from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

She is currently weaned off mechanical ventilation and propofol. Her vital signs are stable, and she has good air movement bilaterally. She has a macular erythematous rash on her chest that is stable and not progressing, concerning for heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. A dermatology consult is planned.

Her persistent fever of unknown origin has resolved for three days. She has been treated with broad coverage antibiotics for multifocal pneumonia of unknown etiology. The possibility that the fever is a drug side effect is considered given the amount of antibiotics she is on. A rheumatic workup is negative for autoimmune disease or malignancy.

She also has secretions likely oropharyngeal in nature, which could indicate early ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, her chest X-ray shows little interval change, and she remains afebrile, so there is no indication for empiric antibiotics at this time.

She has facial edema that resolved after cessation of linezolid and completed a steroid course. Her anemia is stabilized and likely dilutional. Her transaminitis continues to improve, and she has mild dilation of the common bile duct post cholecystectomy with fatty infiltrate of the liver.

She has stable hypertension and continues ASA and statin therapy for her NSTEMI. She also has depression/anxiety, for which she is on home-dose sertraline and increased ativan to 1 mg TID with PRN dose q 2hrs. A social work consult for patient coping skills and continued supportive psychotherapy via nursing and physician are planned.

Her diabetes mellitus type 2 is stable, and she continues with HISS and glargine 16 units qhs."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She presented with hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. The patient's respiratory distress and fevers initially improved after tracheostomy but then worsened due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. Extensive infectious workup was negative, and the patient received various antibiotics, antivirals, and anti-inflammatory medications. The patient's clinical status has improved significantly, but she continues to have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. She has been extubated and remains afebrile. 

The patient's recent events include being weaned off propofol and using ativan for anxiolytic, planned for extubation and transfer to a rehabilitation facility, emotionally labile, and receiving a social work consult for coping skills. She successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation, received a 500 cc bolus due to slightly low urine output, and had her NG tube and peripheral IV removed. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 126/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient underwent tracheostomy on day 3 and was weaned off mechanical ventilation today. She is maintaining saturations on 50% FiO2.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
2. Respiration/gas exchange, impaired
3. Impaired skin integrity
4. Pneumonia, other
5. Diarrhea
6. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/fevers: The patient had respiratory distress and fevers initially, which resolved after treatment for multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause.
2. Impaired gas exchange: The patient's ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation is still a concern, as she requires 50% FiO2 to maintain saturations.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a macular erythematous rash that is stable and not progressing, but further evaluation by a dermatology consult is needed to rule out drug reaction or fungal infection.
4. Pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but had it stopped yesterday. The patient's medical history includes anxiety, coronary artery disease (CAD), anemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and generalized weakness possibly due to critical care myopathy. The patient is currently receiving Ativan for anxiety, aspirin and statins for CAD, and insulin for NIDDM. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 144/77 to 115/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight has decreased from 98 kg at admission to 69.2 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 960 mL and total output of 1154 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 194 mL. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, normal potassium and sodium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 30.4 mmHg, PaO2 of 102 mmHg, and HCO3- of 19 mEq/L. The patient's plan includes monitoring and transfusion of anemia, maintaining glucose control, and eventual physical therapy in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially necessitating reintubation and continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of pneumonia and VAP increases the risk of infection spread and systemic complications such as sepsis.
3. Critical Care Myopathy: The patient's generalized weakness may progress to critical care myopathy, which can result in prolonged muscle weakness and dependency.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations may indicate a risk of hypotension, which could compromise organ perfusion and lead to organ damage.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The negative fluid balance suggests a risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, potentially affecting cardiac function and overall well-being.
7. Liver Dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests may indicate liver injury or dysfunction, which could be related to sepsis, medications, or underlying conditions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 98 kg, 59-inch male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 144/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of generalized weakness and anxiety. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels ranging from 94-112 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but there is evidence of renal impairment with a urine output of 1,154 mL in the past 24 hours. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia, ARDS, and VAP. The patient requires continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She required mechanical ventilation but has since been weaned off. Her fever resolved, but she developed a rash that is stable and not progressing. She also had facial edema, which resolved after stopping Linezolid. Her anemia is likely dilutional, her transaminitis is improving, and her hypertension is stable. She has a history of depression/anxiety and diabetes, both of which are being managed in the ICU. She is currently on a nectar thickened diet, receiving HSSI and glargine for glycemic control, and is on prophylactic heparin for DVT and famotidine for stress ulcer. Her disposition is stable, and she may be transferred to rehab today or tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/fevers: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and fevers, which improved but then recurred. She was diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. Despite treatment, her condition remained unstable, leading to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation. She developed a macular erythematous rash, which could be due to heat/moisture rash,"

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, as evidenced by the multiple dates mentioned.

The patient has several medical allergies, including Atorvastatin, Nausea/Vomiting, Ibuprofen, Nausea/Vomiting, and Levofloxacin with hives.

The patient is currently on various infusions and medications, including lorazepam, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F) at maximum and 36.8 C (98.2 F) currently, heart rate of 89 bpm with a range of 75-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/71 mmHg to 150/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute with a range of 17-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on tracheal mask.

The patient's weight is currently 69.2 kg, down from their admission weight of 98 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 725 mL, with 175 mL coming from total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and an output of 1086 mL, including 175 mL through the nasogastric (NG) tube.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheal mask and has an oxygen saturation of 94%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are mentioned but not provided here.

Physical examination reveals a pleasant and well-appearing patient with no abnormalities noted in the head, neck, cardiovascular, lungs, abdomen, extremities, or skin. Neurological examination shows the patient to be alert and oriented, with intact cranial nerves, preserved sensation, and normal strength and coordination.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab values, such as creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes, are within normal range or show minor fluctuations.

The assessment and plan section of the note includes pain control, respiration/gas exchange, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, diarrhea, and fever. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient appears to be stable with controlled vital signs and no major acute issues. However, the presence of pneumonia, diarrhea, and fever suggests ongoing infections or complications that need to be addressed. Further evaluation and management are required to address these concerns and optimize the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- The patient experienced respiratory distress and fevers, which resolved after treatment with antibiotics and other medications. The cause of the respiratory distress and fevers initially remained unknown.
- She underwent tracheostomy on day 4 and was successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation.
- Despite clinical improvement, the patient repeatedly failed spontaneous breathing trials due to tachypnea, likely caused by increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, some mild drug withdrawal, and decreased lung compliance from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient developed an erythematous rash, which is resolving and may be due to a heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. Dermatology consultation has been requested.
- Her nutrition has been advanced to pureed solids and nectar-thickened liquids. A video swallow study has been scheduled.
- The patient had facial edema, which resolved after cessation of Linezolid. The etiology is unclear, and a completed steroid course was administered.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. The initial assessment indicated respiratory distress/fevers, likely due to multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause. The patient's fevers resolved after receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but she repeatedly failed spontaneous breathing tests (SBT) due to tachypnea, increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, mild drug withdrawal, and decreased lung compliance from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As a result, a tracheostomy was performed.

The patient's subsequent course included a new rash, which is stable and not progressing. It is concerning for heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. Dermatology consult has been requested, and miconazole/hydrocortisone cream is to be applied as needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The initial assessment revealed hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema of unknown cause.

The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, cefepime, vancomycin, azithromycin) and antiviral therapy (oseltamivir). However, the patient failed spontaneous breathing trials due to tachypnea, which was likely multifactorial. She underwent tracheostomy placement and weaning off mechanical ventilation.

Despite clinical improvement, the patient developed a new rash that is stable and not progressing. It is concerning for heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. Dermatology consult has been requested, and the patient is being treated with miconazole/hydrocortisone cream as needed.

The patient's facial edema resolved after discontinuation of Linezolid, and her anemia is likely dilutional. Her liver function tests show mild fatty infiltrate of the liver post-cholecystectomy. Her hypertension and NSTEMI are being managed with appropriate medications.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a history of NSTEMI. She was admitted with symptoms of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The initial assessment revealed hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray, leading to a diagnosis of pneumonia and pulmonary edema. 

The patient underwent extensive infectious workup, including negative autoimmune and infectious tests, and was treated with various antibiotics. She also received oseltamivir for suspected influenza and doxycycline. However, her clinical status improved significantly, and she was weaned off mechanical ventilation.

The patient developed a macular erythematous rash, which could be attributed to a heat/moisture rash, drug reaction, or fungal infection. Dermatology consult was requested, and miconazole/hydrocortisone cream was applied as needed.

Tracheostomy was performed due to repeated failure of spontaneous breathing tests (SBT), primarily caused by increased work of breathing after prolonged intubation, anxiety, mild drug withdrawal, and decreased lung compliance from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's facial edema resolved after discontinuing Linezolid, and her anemia is believed to be dilutional. Her liver function tests showed improvement, but there is mild dilatation of the common bile duct following cholecystectomy. Her hypertension and diabetes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, and vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. It is important to monitor her respiratory status and ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which could be due to various reasons such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea or an underlying gastrointestinal infection. Monitoring her fluid and electrolyte balance is essential.

3. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has had fevers throughout her stay, initially thought to be caused by multi-focal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. However, extensive infectious workup and autoimmune workup were negative. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the persistent fevers.

4. Chest pain: The patient complained of chest pain, which was initially suspected to be cardiac ischemia. However, cardiac workup including EKG and cardiac enzymes was negative. The chest pain may be related to anxiety or other non-cardiac causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She presented with fever, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have hypoxia and multi-focal infiltrates on chest X-ray. She underwent tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation but was successfully weaned off it today. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, antivirals, and anti-inflammatory medications. Her respiratory distress and fevers initially resolved, but she developed erythematous rash, facial edema, and diarrhea. The rash resolved after discontinuing Linezolid, and facial edema improved with steroid treatment. The patient's anemia is likely dilutional, and she has mild transaminitis with fatty infiltrate of the liver. Her blood pressure is stable, and she continues with antiplatelet and statin therapy for her NSTEMI. She is also being treated for depression/anxiety and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with multi-focal pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics. However, persistence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggests ongoing respiratory infection or other complications such as pulmonary edema.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient is at risk due to her recent tracheostomy and increased work of breathing.
3. Drug reactions: The patient had an erythematous rash, which could be due to a drug reaction. It is important to monitor for any signs of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other drug-related complications.
4. Diarrhea: The patient developed diarrhea, which can be caused by various factors including antibiotic-associated colitis or other infections. Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance is necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely dilutional, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has mild transaminitis with fatty infiltrate of the liver. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended.
7. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, long-term management of hypertension is important to prevent future cardiovascular events.
8. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, and her glycemic control needs to be monitored closely during her ICU stay.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and testing may be required to determine the exact causes and appropriate management for each condition."
