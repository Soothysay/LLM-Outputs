","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer, who presented initially to an outside hospital with jaundice on 7/18. He underwent an ERCP on 7/22 and subsequently developed hematemesis. The patient was hemodynamically stable and transferred to this hospital unit for closer monitoring. His current condition includes mild hypoxia with a saturation of 94% on room air, bilateral pleural effusions, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent episode of hematemesis post-ERCP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient experienced hematemesis post ERCP, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. Further evaluation and management are required to control the bleeding and prevent rebleeding.
2. Gastric Cancer Recurrence: Given the patient's history of gastric cancer and recent biopsy during ERCP, there is a concern for recurrence of the disease. Follow-up biopsy results are pending to evaluate for recurrence.
3. Jaundice: The patient has persistent jaundice with elevated liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase levels. This suggests ongoing liver dysfunction, potentially due to biliary obstruction or metastatic disease. Further investigation, such as an imaging study (PTC and biliary drainage), is needed to identify the cause.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's mild hypoxia could be attributed to atelectasis, ascites,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer who presented initially with jaundice and was transferred for an ERCP procedure. Post-procedure, he developed hematemesis and is currently being monitored in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has mild hypoxia with a saturation level of 94% on room air. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent event of hematemesis. The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions and blunting of costodiaphagmatic angles. The patient's assessment and plan include potential redevelopment of gastric carcinoma, grade III esophagitis, and ongoing monitoring for gastrointestinal bleed. He is receiving IV proton pump inhibitor, zofran for nausea, and has been advised to continue taking Unasyn for the GI bleed. The patient's INR is slightly elevated, and his hemoglobin level is currently at 40.2, which is above the threshold for transfusion. The plan also includes obtaining large bore peripheral IVs, sending complete blood count and typing, and holding atenolol due to hypertension. The patient's code status is full, and he is pending clinical improvement before disposition."

- Post-ERCP, the patient developed hematemesis and was hemodynamically stable. He was then transferred to the current hospital unit for closer monitoring.
- The patient experienced hematemesis post ERCP, and biopsies were taken during the procedure. There is a suspicion of redevelopment of gastric carcinoma. Contact bleeding was also noted in the area of his friable gastric mucosa, along with grade III esophagitis, which could be another possible source of bleeding.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/91 mmHg to 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94%.
- The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, as seen on chest X-ray, and blunting of costodiaphagmatic angles bilaterally.
- Lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and AP), increased total bilirubin (Tbili), decreased phosphorus,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with gastric cancer who presented with obstructive jaundice. He was transferred from another hospital for an ERCP procedure and subsequently developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's vital signs are stable, and there have been no further episodes of hematemesis. His Hct level is 40.6%, indicating stable blood volume.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient has already experienced UGIB, which can lead to significant blood loss and require urgent intervention to control the bleeding.
2. Biliary obstruction: The patient's jaundice is due to a biliary obstruction caused by a CBD stricture. This may require a biliary drain placement by interventional radiology (IR) to relieve the obstruction.
3. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions seen on imaging since his transfer from the outside hospital. These effusions need to be evaluated, and if they persist or worsen, they may require drainage and further investigation.
4. Gastric cancer: The patient has known gastric cancer with abnormalities at the anastomosis site. Biopsy results from previous procedures are pending, and follow-up imaging from the outside hospital is needed to assess the extent of the disease.
5. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing mild hypoxia, which is likely related to known effusions and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Oxygen requirements"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer who presented with obstructive jaundice and underwent ERCP. He was found to have grade 3 esophagitis in the distal esophagus, friable gastric mucosa, and edematous tissue at the anastomosis site with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has since been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. UGIB: The patient's history of gastric cancer and the presence of friable mucosa at the anastomosis site indicate a risk for recurrent bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment of hemodynamic stability are necessary.

2. Biliary obstruction: The patient's obstructive jaundice suggests an obstruction in the biliary system. The inability to reach the ampulla during ERCP and subsequent placement of an internal biliary drain indicate a potential complication related to biliary drainage.

3. Gastric cancer recurrence: The abnormalities at the anastomosis site raise concerns for recurrent gastric cancer. Further evaluation with biopsy results is required to confirm this possibility.

4. Bilateral pleural effusions: The presence of pleural effusions on imaging may indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs. It is important to assess the patient's respiratory status and consider potential causes such as malignancy or infection.

5. Hypoxia: The patient's requirement for supplemental"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer, who presented to the hospital with obstructive jaundice. He underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed grade 3 esophagitis in the distal esophagus, friable gastric mucosa, and edematous areas at the anastomosis site. The patient also had contact bleeding from the stomach, but no further episodes of hematemesis occurred. A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) and biliary drainage were performed due to an inability to reach the ampulla.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/86 to 130/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with clear breath sounds and no evidence of cyanosis or clubbing. The abdomen is soft and tender in the right lower quadrant, with distension noted. The neurologic examination is not assessed.

Lab results show a hemoglobin level of 40.6%, and fluid analysis and other lab results are pending. Imaging reveals small lung volumes and bilateral effusions. Microbiology results are also pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), biliary obstruction, gastric cancer, pleural effusions,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer, who presented initially to an outpatient setting with jaundice on 7/18. He was transferred to Hospital1 for ERCP on 7/22 and post-procedure developed hematemesis twice. The patient was hemodynamically stable and transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation via an arterial line. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. Blood cultures have been obtained, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection, as indicated by fever, elevated white blood cell count, and the presence of bacteria in blood cultures. Immediate management includes administering appropriate antibiotics, monitoring vital signs, and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation.
2. GI Bleed: The patient experienced hematemesis post ERCP, which may be due to contact bleeding or redeveloped gastric carcinoma. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and coagulation profile is necessary. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors and transfusion for hematocrit levels below 30 should be considered.
3. Jaundice: The patient"

   [**7-18**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for ERCP on [**7-22**], post procedure
   developed hematemesis x 2, was hemodynamically stable, transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for closer monitoring.
   .
   # GI Bleed: the patient experienced hematemesis post ERCP.  He had
   biopsies taken during his ERCP, consider redevelopment of gastric
   carcinoma.  Also had contact bleeding noted in the area of his friable
   gastric mucosa.  He also has grade III esophagitis noted, another
   possible source.
   -obtain 2 large bore PIVs
   -send hct and type and screen

   # Jaundice:
   -resend LFTs
   -at OSH mainly direct hyperbilirubinemia, AST and ALT in 200-400 range
   and alk phos to 500s.  T bili had been 11.4 at the highest on [**2193-7-21**].
   Liver enzymes still elevated, AP and T bili are trending upwards.
   -will need IR for PTC and biliary drainage

   # Hypoxia: mild hypoxia to sat of 94%.  He has atelectasis, ascites,
   pleural effusions and these are likely contributing factors.  Only ?
   atelectasis on OSH CXR on [**7-18**].  No fevers, cough, lungs are clear, no
   h/o CHF and JVP is not elevated.  Likely related to ascites and pleural

 HEMATEMESIS (UPPER GI BLEED, UGIB)
   Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 80 yoM w/ a h/o gastric cancer
   s/p billroth II in '[**91**] presented initially to an OSH w/ jaundice on
   [**7-18**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for ERCP on [**7-22**], post procedure
   developed hematemesis x 2, was hemodynamically stable, transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for closer monitoring.
   .
   # GI Bleed: the patient experienced hematemesis post ERCP.  He had
   biopsies taken during his ERCP, consider redevelopment of gastric
   carcinoma.  Also had contact bleeding noted in the area of his friable
   gastric mucosa.  He also has grade III esophagitis noted, another
   possible source.
   -obtain 2 large bore PIVs
   -send hct and type and screen
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -zofran prn
   -INR at OSH slightly elevated at 1.3, PTT was 30.  Repeat Coags show
   INR 1.2.
   -transfuse for hct < 30 for now given that his hct is currently 40.2.
   -hold atenolol
   -tele
   -continue unasyn for GI bleed
   -f/u ERCP recs, ERCP is aware of hematemesis
   .
   # Gastric cancer: s/p resection, chemo / radiation.
   -f/u biopsy results to evaluate for recurrance
   .
   # Jaundice:
   -resend LFTs
   -at OSH mainly direct hyperbilirubinemia, AST and ALT in 200-400 range
   and alk phos to 500s.  T bili had been 11.4 at the highest on [**2193-7-21**].
   Liver enzymes still elevated, AP and T bili are trending upwards.
   -will need IR for PTC and biliary drainage
   .
   # Hypoxia: mild hypoxia to sat of 94%.  He has atelectasis, ascites,
   pleural effusions and these are likely contributing factors.  Only ?
   atelectasis on OSH CXR on [**7-18**].  No fevers, cough, lungs are clear, no
   h/o CHF and JVP is not elevated.  Likely related to ascites and pleural
   effusions causing atelecatsis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer who presented with obstructive jaundice. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure in the ICU for management of post-procedure upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient experienced hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia after the procedure, which were likely related to sepsis secondary to biliary obstruction. The patient's condition improved with fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's current issues include sepsis post PTC placement, biliary obstruction, pleural effusions, hypoxia, UGIB, and gastric cancer. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Due to the presence of biliary obstruction and recent PTC placement, there is a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.

2. Biliary obstruction: The patient has obstructive jaundice, and further intervention may be required to relieve the obstruction. This could involve repeat ERCP with stent placement or other surgical interventions.

3. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which can compromise respiratory function. Monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is important. Drainage of the effusions may be necessary.

4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the recent ERCP procedure and the presence of an arterial line. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have already been started, which is appropriate.

2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient presented to the hospital with UGIB and underwent an ERCP procedure. There is a concern for ongoing bleeding or re-bleeding, especially considering the friable mucosa seen during the procedure.

3. Biliary obstruction: The patient has a history of gastric cancer and presented with obstructive jaundice. The inability to reach the ampulla of Vater during the ERCP raises concern for a malignant biliary obstruction.

4. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral effusions, which were seen on OSH imaging. These effusions may be due to the patient's underlying malignancy or as a complication of the ERCP procedure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

5. Hypoxia: The patient experienced increased oxygen requirements post-procedure and has a history of known effusions, which could contribute to hypoxia. Additionally, there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia given the patient's recent intubation.

6. Recurrent gastric cancer: The abnormalities at the anastomosis site are highly concerning for recurrent gastric cancer. Further evaluation, such as biopsy results, is"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer, who presented initially with jaundice and was later admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, following which he experienced hematemesis (vomiting of blood). Biopsies were taken during the ERCP to evaluate for the possible redevelopment of gastric carcinoma.

The patient's current condition includes moderate ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen), with largest pockets identified in the left lower quadrant. There is also evidence of fluid in the biliary drain, but no polymorphonuclear leukocytes or microorganisms were seen. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support through a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results indicate mild hyponatremia (low sodium level) at 131 mEq/L, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and direct hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's white blood cell count is low, and there is an increased percentage of band cells. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical history includes"

   Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 80 yoM w/ a h/o gastric cancer
   s/p billroth II in '[**91**] presented initially to an OSH w/ jaundice on
   [**7-18**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for ERCP on [**7-22**], post procedure
   developed hematemesis x 2, was hemodynamically stable, transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for closer monitoring.
   # Sepsis: Bld, urine, MRSA Cx are pending.  Fluid Cx showed no PMNs/
   microorganisms.  Remains afebrile.
   - recheck WBC with diff
   - continue with vanc and zosyn until cx results.
   - consider dx tap of ascites fluid
   # GI Bleed: the patient experienced hematemesis post ERCP.  He had
   biopsies taken during his ERCP, consider redevelopment of gastric
   carcinoma.  Also had contact bleeding noted in the area of his friable
   gastric mucosa.  He also has grade III esophagitis noted, another
   possible source.
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -zofran prn
   -INR at OSH slightly elevated at 1.3, PTT was 30.  Repeat Coags show
   INR 1.2.
   -transfuse for hct < 30 for now given that his hct is currently 36.
   -hold atenolol
   -tele
   -continue unasyn for GI bleed
   -f/u ERCP recs, ERCP is aware of hematemesis
   .
   # Gastric cancer: s/p resection, chemo / radiation.
   -f/u biopsy results to evaluate for recurrence
   .
   # Jaundice: LFTs are improving s/p PCT.
   -resend LFTs
   -at OSH mainly direct hyperbilirubinemia, AST and ALT in 200-400 range
   and alk phos to 500s.  T bili had been 11.4 at the highest on [**2193-7-21**].
   Liver enzymes still elevated, AP and T bili are trending upwards.
   .
   # Hypoxia: mild hypoxia to sat of 94%.  He has atelectasis, ascites,
   pleural effusions and these are likely contributing factors.  Likely
   related to ascites and pleural effusions causing atelecatsis. No
   fevers, no h/o CHF and JVP is not elevated.  This morning, stated cough
   with green sputum.
   - send for sputum culture
   - PA / Lat CXR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer who presented to the hospital with jaundice and was found to have a moderately large amount of fluid throughout the abdomen, with largest pockets identified in the left lower quadrant. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, after which he developed hematemesis. He was then transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: Blood, urine, and MRSA cultures are pending, and the patient remains afebrile. The physician is rechecking the WBC with diff, continuing with vancomycin and Zosyn until culture results, and considering a diagnostic tap of ascites fluid.

2. GI Bleed: The patient experienced hematemesis post ERCP, and biopsies were taken during the procedure. Contact bleeding was also noted in the area of his friable gastric mucosa. The physician is prescribing IV PPI, Zofran prn, and continuing with Unasyn for the GI bleed. They are also following up on ERCP recommendations and informing the ERCP team about the hematemesis.

3. Gastric Cancer: The patient had previous surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation for gastric cancer. The physician is waiting for biopsy results to evaluate for recurrence.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer, who presented to the hospital with obstructive jaundice. He underwent an ERCP procedure in the ICU for the management of post-procedure upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient experienced hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia following the placement of a percutaneous transhepatic biliary (PTC) drain. The patient's current condition is stable, with improved hemodynamics and respiratory status. However, he has several ongoing issues including cholangitis/biliary sepsis with CBD stricture, pleural effusions, hypoxia, UGIB, gastric cancer, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and deconditioning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis/biliary sepsis with CBD stricture: The patient has an ongoing infection in the biliary system, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis or abscess formation if not properly managed.
2. Pleural effusions: The presence of fluid in the pleural space can potentially compromise lung function and lead to respiratory distress if not addressed.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels can be attributed to the known effusions, basilar atelectasis, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Close monitoring and implementation of appropriate interventions, such as incentive spirometry, are necessary to maintain adequate"

   for management of post procedure UGIB (hematemesis) course c/b
   hypotension, tachycarida and hypoxia post PTC placement, now doing well
   with stable hemodynamics and resp status
     Issues include:
              Sepsis post ptc placement with hypotension, tachycardia,
   increased hypoxia now improved
          Biliary obstruction
              Pleural effusions
          Hypoxia
              UGIB
          Gastric CA
              hyponatremia
              thromboyctopenia
   #  Sepsis-hypotension post procedure, now resolved after IVFs. Highest
   concern for biliary source with transient bacteremia in setting of PTC
   placement, though also possibly [**12-24**] asp event in setting of
   intubation/extubation.  Bl cx ngtd.  GNR is ptc drain.  Will d/c vanco
   and continue zosyn epnding cx data.
   # Hypoxia
weaned back to 2 L NC. Likely related to known effusions,
   basilar atelectasis, component of OSA.  Incentive spirometer.
   # hyponatremia-recheck labs to confirm. If acuarrate, difficult volume
   status as total body volume up but intrasvascularrly dry. Taking poor
   POs. Will limit free h2o and give fluid challenge.
   # New onset jaundice: in setting of CBD stricture, very concerning for
   malignancy, unable to reach ampulla by ercp, now s/p PTC.  ERCP team
   plans for repeat attempt at stent placement with brushings. Clarify
   time course, likely end of week. Continue to follow LFTs which are now
   trending down.
   # Gastric Ca- abnormalities at anastamosis are highly concerning for
   recurrence. F/u BX results. Rads to review OSH imaging
   # Bilat effusions
Seen on osh imaging since [**Month (only) **] (per report).
   Increased in setting of fluid resus. Check albumin as nutirional status
   poor X months and third spacing.  Clarify if ever, sampled as concern
   for possible malignancy. Check abd us to eval for ascities tracking,
   and consider dx para.
   # UGIB: in setting of procedure (ercp).   With friable mucosa seen and
   bx at prior suture site.  Suspect post procedural bleeding, versus
   esophagitis/gastritis. H/h have remained stable and no further bleeding
   seen.  Continue PPI
   # Thrombocytopenia--montior, on boots

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer who presented to the hospital with obstructive jaundice. He underwent an ERCP procedure in the ICU for management of post-procedure upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was found to have sepsis post PTC placement. The patient's vital signs have stabilized, but he still has issues including biliary obstruction, pleural effusions, hypoxia, UGIB, gastric cancer, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis - The patient had sepsis post PTC placement, which has now improved with IV fluids. However, there is a concern for a biliary source of infection with transient bacteremia.
2. Biliary obstruction - The patient has obstructive jaundice, and there is concern for a CBD stricture, possibly due to malignancy. The ERCP team plans to attempt stent placement with brushings.
3. Pleural effusions - The patient has bilateral effusions, which were seen on OSH imaging. These may be due to fluid resuscitation, third spacing, or possibly malignancy.
4. Hypoxia - The patient experienced hypoxia post PTC placement, which is likely related to known effusions and basilar atelectasis. Incentive spirometry has been initiated.
5. UGIB - The patient had upper"
