","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac arrhythmia and experienced a cardiac event, leading to the placement of a pacemaker. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, urinary tract infection, coronary artery disease, and cough. She is currently being treated for these conditions and is also receiving prophylactic heparin due to her risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of complete heart block and the placement of a pacemaker indicate a potential risk for cardiac arrhythmias. It is crucial to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and adjust the pacemaker settings as necessary.
2. Seizure recurrence: Although the patient did not have any further seizure episodes during her stay, her history of seizures and the recent seizure triggered by captopril should be considered. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management of seizures are essential.
3. UTI recurrence: The patient's dirty urinary analysis in the emergency department suggests a urinary tract infection. Monitoring for any signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment are important to prevent UTI recurrence.
4. CAD progression: The patient's decreased ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormality on TTE indicate underlying coronary artery disease. Risk stratification with persantine mibi prior to discharge and consideration of statin treatment will help manage this condition.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, who presented with complete heart block (CHB) and a seizure. She underwent pacemaker insertion and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's 24-hour events include the placement of a pacemaker, an EEG pending, decreased urine output at 2300 with dry mucous membranes, administration of a 500cc bolus, increased captopril to 25tid, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with global hypokinesis and probable basal inferior hypokinesis.

The patient has allergies to antibiotics, is on infusions of heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other medications such as changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flowsheet data.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 70-72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/64 to 121/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an overall fluid balance of -1003mL.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented, with no chest wall deformities or scoliosis, soft abdomen without tenderness, and no pitting edema but swollen legs. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, complete heart block, hypertension, urinary tract infection, and likely ischemic cardiomyopathy. 

The patient underwent a pacemaker placement (PPM) due to complete heart block. She also received a 500cc bolus due to decreased oral intake and dry mucous membranes. Her blood pressure is elevated, so captopril was increased to 25mg twice a day. 

The patient's echocardiogram (TTE) showed a normal-sized left atrium, estimated right atrial pressure of 0-5 mmHg, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF=45%) with mild global hypokinesis and probable basal inferior hypokinesis. There was mild thickening of the aortic valve leaflets with no aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation, and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient's recent labs showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate. The rest of the lab values were within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination revealed jugular venous distention at the"

24-hour events:
- The patient had a pacemaker inserted.
- EEG results pending.
- Decreased urine output at 11 PM, dry on examination, received a 500cc bolus.
- Blood pressure in the 150s, increased captopril to 25 tid.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed normal left atrium size, estimated right atrial pressure of 0-5 mmHg, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 45%, mild global hypokinesis, probable basal inferior hypokinesis, mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets without aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets, mild mitral regurgitation, and trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
