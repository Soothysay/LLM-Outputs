","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), post cyberknife treatment, underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and emphysema. The patient presents with worsening hypoxia, but without respiratory distress. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/71 to 146/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a history of sneezing, suggesting a possible viral upper respiratory infection (URI). There are no signs of pneumonia or fluid overload, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) is negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's acute flare-up of IPF is suspected, and he has been started on immunosuppressive therapy with Imuran, which has been discontinued. The patient is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage for empirical pneumonia, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. Nebulizers will be used, avoiding albuterol due to tachycardia. Follow-up blood cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis have been ordered. The patient is on Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease (ILD), lung hemorrhage possibly due to immune-mediated vasculitis, and acute alveolar hemorrhage complicating radiation pneumonitis. The patient is also experiencing hypoxemia attributed to ILD and alveolar hemorrhage. Additionally, the patient has chronic corticosteroid use, asbestos exposure with evident plaques on CXR, renal failure (acute on chronic), and a history of lung cancer treated with cyberknife RUL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Progressive respiratory failure due to worsening ILD and alveolar hemorrhage.
2. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation.
3. Further deterioration of renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease.
4. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and underlying hypercoagulable state.
5. Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to chronic corticosteroid use and potential stress ulceration.
6. Complications related to long-term aspiration pneumonia due to impaired swallowing and cough reflexes.

   Assessment and Plan
   Interstial lung disease, lung hemorrhage (?immune mediated).
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute alveolar hemorrhage
   complicating radiation pneumonitis, underlying ILD.  Doubt acute
   infection.  No evidence for pulmonary embolism.  Plan supplimental O2,
   maintain SaO2 >88%.  Empirical antimicrobials, but may be able to d/c
   soon.
   ILD -- attributed to radiation-induced pneumonitis, ?vasculitis -->
   continue steroids, plan pulse-dose (1 gm/day) x 3-5 days.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to ILD, alveolar hemmorhage.
   CHRONIC CORTICOSTEROIDS --  desire steroid sparing regimen.  Continue
   PcP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**].
   LUNG CA -- not surgical candidate --> s/p cyberknife RUL.  No further
   intervention planned.
   ASBESTOS EXPOSURE -- plaques evident by CXR & CT.  No further
   intervention.
   FLUIDS -- desire net balance.  Follow I/O.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic.  Recent insult may be related to iv
   contrast dye (CT angio on [**2147-10-8**]) --> ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine,
   UO.  Check UA.  Consider Pulmonary Renal syndrome.  Low threshold for
   Renal Consult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxemia due to acute alveolar hemorrhage complicating radiation pneumonitis, underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 124/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a venti mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, indicating possible pulmonary edema or fluid accumulation. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There is no evidence of cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, suggesting cardiac stress or dysfunction.

The patient's current assessment includes interstitial lung disease, lung hemorrhage (possibly immune-mediated), respiratory distress attributed to acute alveolar hemorrhage complicating radiation pneumonitis and underlying ILD, hypoxemia due to ILD and alveolar hemorrhage, chronic corticosteroid use for lung cancer treatment, and renal failure, which may be acute on chronic and potentially related to intravenous contrast dye exposure.

The plan for the patient's care involves"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone cyberknife treatment and UIP (likely referring to interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis). The patient presents with worsening hypoxia and acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure. The etiology of the respiratory failure may include intra-alveolar hemorrhage, UIP flare, or pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been responsive to dose steroids in the past. 

The patient's current medications include Solumiderol (steroid), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vancomycin, and cefepime for empiric PNA. Other medications such as levaquin, Bactrim prophylaxis, and beta-agonists are discontinued. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 119 bpm and an oxygen saturation of 93% on a venti mask. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there are no readings for peripheral pulses. 

The patient's respiratory status is concerning with crackles on auscultation and bilateral intra-alveolar disease seen on CT scan. The patient's neurological status appears to be intact based on the provided information. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), and increased creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values including glucose, electroly"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) status post cyberknife treatment and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The patient presents with worsening hypoxia, and the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute on Chronic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's breathing has slightly improved, but the etiology of the respiratory failure still includes intra-alveolar hemorrhage, UIP flare, and possible pneumonia. The patient is currently receiving Solumedrol, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vancomycin, cefepime, and Bactrim as part of their treatment plan.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated from 1.8 to 2.0 today. The differential diagnosis for ARF includes pre-renal azotemia, contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), and pulmonary-renal syndrome. The urine sediment is within normal limits. The patient's I/O goal is to maintain even balance, and a low threshold for renal consultation is recommended.

3. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has continued hemoglobin drop, with a platelet count less than 100 for the second consecutive day. Normal erythropoietin (EPO) levels were previously noted. The patient's anemia and thromboc"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory distress. They have a history of radiation-associated capillaritis, which is causing an exacerbation of respiratory symptoms. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen and steroids for this condition. There are also findings of radiation pneumonitis on radiographs. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, possibly related to adverse drug reactions. Fluid balance is being carefully managed, and the patient is on systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Good rate control is being maintained for atrial fibrillation. The patient's nutritional and glycemic control needs are also being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Radiation-associated capillaritis: This condition can worsen respiratory symptoms and lead to further respiratory distress.
2. Radiation pneumonitis: The diffuse lung disease may progress and impact oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Anemia: If severe, it could lead to decreased tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Fluid imbalance: Negative fluid balance should be carefully monitored to prevent dehydration or fluid overload.
6. Atrial fibrillation: Poor rate control may lead to hemodynamic instability and potential complications like stroke.
7. Adverse drug reactions: Some medications may cause additional side effects or interactions that need to be closely monitored.
8. Infection: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of NSCLC, who underwent cyberknife treatment and is presenting with worsening hypoxia. The patient has acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, with potential etiologies including intra-alveolar hemorrhage, UIP flare, and pneumonia. The patient is currently on a ventilator, receiving solomon (beta-agonist), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vancomycin, cefepime, and bactrim prophylaxis. The patient's renal function is worsening, with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 and 2.0 today. The differential diagnosis for acute renal failure includes pre-renal azotemia, contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), and pulmonary-renal syndrome. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are also present, with a drop in hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient has been diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease (AICD), but further evaluation for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is being considered. Tachycardia is likely due to myocardial ischemia versus nonspecific tachycardia with premature atrial contractions (PACs). The patient's anemia is near baseline, and hypertension is controlled. Fluid management, including KVO (kidney vein oxygenation) and regular renal diet, is being implemented. Prophylactic measures include pneumoc"

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone Cyberknife treatment and radiation. The patient presents with worsening hypoxia and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a Venti mask at 12L at 50% FiO2. The etiology of acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure includes intra-alveolar hemorrhage or vasculitis, radiation pneumonitis flare, and possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient is on day 3 of Solvado (methylprednisolone) 1 gm daily for 3-5 days, then tapering off. Other medications include N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and pentamidine.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia with low hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 2.3. Other lab values include elevated fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes. The coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but normal INR. The electrolyte levels are within normal range.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, renal failure, anemia, ILD/IPF (interstitial lung disease/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and diabetes mellitus.

Respiratory failure is attributed to vasculitis or a flair of radiation pneumonitis. The possibility of infection is doubtful, and it is suggested to discontinue antimicrobials.

Renal failure has improved and returned to baseline. Anemia is progressive but without obvious blood loss. ILD/IPF is chronic and stable. Thrombocytopenia should be monitored, with platelet transfusion if the count is less than 20 or there is an active bleed. Leukopenia is evolving and could be related to infection, an immune-mediated process, or medication effect.

Diabetes mellitus has worsened due to high-dose steroids, and glucose levels should be monitored to maintain them below 150 mg/dL.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of these various complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of NSCLC who underwent Cyberknife treatment and radiation therapy. He presents with worsening hypoxia and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a Venti mask at 12L and 50% FiO2. The patient's condition is complicated by acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, pancytopenia, acute kidney injury, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure: This condition can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count increase the risk of infections, bleeding, and other complications related to decreased cell counts.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. If not addressed promptly, ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease, necessitating renal replacement therapy.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's rapid heart rate may be due to various causes such as infection, fever, or stress. If left untreated, it can lead to complications like myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.

5. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular events"

- Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a net loss of 820 mL since 12 AM.
- The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Bactrim, Vancomycin, and Cefipime) and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.
- Labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, along with decreased platelet count.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to the presence of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels may indicate anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding or bruising, as platelets are essential for blood clotting.

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent Cyberknife treatment and radiation. He presents with worsening hypoxia, and his respiratory support has been increased to a venti mask at 12L with 50% FiO2. The etiology of acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure includes intra-alveolar hemorrhage (or vasculitis), radiation pneumonitis flare, and possible pneumonia (PNA). He is currently on day 3 of solumederol 1gm daily, and it will be continued for 3-5 days before tapering.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with worsening hypoxia. He has undergone cyberknife treatment and radiation therapy. The patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, and his condition is complicated by underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary hemorrhage, and radiation pneumonitis flare.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, stable blood pressure, and respiratory rate within normal range. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% on 50% FiO2 with the use of a venti mask. Laboratory results indicate pancytopenia with white blood cell count of 6K, hematocrit of 23, and platelet count of 57. Renal function is stable with creatinine levels at 1.8.

The patient is currently on a weaning schedule for oxygen, with plans to taper prednisone to 1mg/kg (60-70mgs) and continue N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The use of beta-agonists is avoided, and follow-up viral swab is pending. Once pancytopenia begins to resolve, the consideration of starting Cellcept will be made based on rheumatology recommendations.

The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is stable with baseline creatinine levels of 1.8. The goal is to maintain even fluid balance"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU. They have a history of chronic anemia, acute thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient received prednisone 1mg/kg, started on cellcept, and had cultures taken. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but they require respiratory support with a venti mask. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments are not documented. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels below normal, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and high glucose levels. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 990 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and recent administration of antibiotics suggest a potential infection. If not properly managed, this could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels indicate possible kidney dysfunction. This could be due to various factors such as dehydration or underlying kidney disease.
3. Hyperglycemia: The consistently high glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can lead to complications like diabetic ketoacidosis or increased risk of infection.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Although the platelet count has improved, the patient initially presented with acute thrombocytopenia. Monitoring for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of NSCLC who presented with worsening hypoxia. The patient has undergone cyberknife treatment and radiation therapy for his cancer. The patient's respiratory status has improved since yesterday, but the etiology of acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is still uncertain, with intra-alveolar hemorrhage or vasculitis, UIP/radiation pneumonitis flare, and pneumonia less likely given the negative BAL NGTD.

The patient completed 3 days of IV Solu-Medrol 1gm daily and was switched to oral prednisone. Antibiotics were discontinued without worsening of respiratory status. The patient is currently on 4L NC and will continue to be weaned off oxygen as tolerated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is being continued for interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, pancytopenia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a known history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AOCD). The possible causes of anemia include chronic disease plus low-level hemolysis given low haptoglobin as well as chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's tachycardia is likely due to pulmonary fibrosis, and hypertension is well-controlled.

Plan:
- Continue prednisone 1mg/kg daily with slow taper.
- Wean down oxygen as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with NSCLC who has undergone cyberknife treatment and radiation therapy. He presents with worsening hypoxia and is diagnosed with acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure. The etiology includes intra-alveolar hemorrhage or vasculitis, radiation pneumonitis flare, and pneumonia. The patient is currently on solomon 1gm daily for 3-5 days and will be weaned off oxygen as tolerated. He will continue NAC and Cellcept once pancytopenia begins resolving. Other medical conditions include acute renal failure with baseline Cr 1.8 and pancytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia indicates a potential complication of respiratory failure. It is important to closely monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels and adjust ventilatory support as needed.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia as a contributing factor to the patient's hypoxia suggests a potential infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary.

3. Radiation pneumonitis flare: The patient's history of radiation therapy and the diagnosis of radiation pneumonitis indicate a potential complication related to the previous treatment. Monitoring for worsening symptoms and providing supportive care will be important.

4. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage or vasculitis: The possibility of intra-alveolar hemorrhage or vasculitis contributing"
