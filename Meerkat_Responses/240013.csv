","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/65 to 166/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

24-hour events:
- The patient had rising blood pressures and heart rates last night, which were initially thought to be due to early alcohol withdrawal. Valium was administered at a dose of 15mg for CIWA >10, resulting in good effect.
- The patient also experienced increased shortness of breath and work of breathing, along with crackles in the lungs. After receiving 10mg of Lasix, the patient was able to advance from 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen to room air.

Allergies:
The patient is allergic to sulfa (sulfonamides).

Medications:
- Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) was administered at [**2178-8-21**] 02:00 AM.
- Ciprofloxacin was given at [**2178-8-21**] 05:00 AM.

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient was afebrile overnight but he did have some rising SBPs to 160s
   and HR in 100s last night which was thought to have been possible early
   ETOH withdrawal so pt. was given 15mg valium administered for CIWA >10
   w/ good effect. He also
   got 10mg Lasix after  increased SOB and  WOB, crackles in lungs, he put
   1 liter out and dyspnea improved and he advanced from 5 L NC to RA

   > 30cc/hr
   - ciprofloxacin and Pip-tazo for double gram negative coverage.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   .
   # Anemia - Possibly hemolysis given elevated LDH, T. Bili, and
   thrombocytopenia (platelets fell from 208 on [**8-18**] to 134 at present)
   - Send Haptoglobin, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count
   - Transfuse for Hct < 27 or hemodynamic instability
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia, unclear etiology - Continue to monitor.  D/C
   heparin SC and monitor.  Can consider HIT testing if continuing to
   fall.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with hypotension, leukopenia, and tachypnea. The likely source is urinary versus gastrointestinal given the positive urinalysis and recent instrumentation.

He presents with gram-negative sepsis from a presumed urinary source. The patient meets SIRS criteria with hypotension, leukopenia, and tachypnea. 

The plan includes obtaining abdominal CT reports to assess for intra-abdominal source, central venous line placement, IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12, transfusion for Hct > 30, IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, ciprofloxacin and Pip-tazo for double gram-negative coverage, follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures, and trend WBC count fever curve.

Additionally, the patient has anemia, possibly due to hemolysis given elevated LDH, T. Bili, and thrombocytopenia (platelets fell from 208 on [8-18] to 134 at present). Haptoglobin, peripheral smear, and reticulocyte count should be sent, and transfusion for Hct < 27 or hemodynamic instability should be considered.

Thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology should be monitored, and HIT testing may be considered if the platelet count continues to fall. Transaminitis is likely secondary to sepsis and should"

   Assesment: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
   hypertension, BPH who presents with E.Coli gram negative sepsis from a
   presumed urinary source.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient  initially met SIRS criteria with hypotension,
   leukopenia, tachypnea.  Now ruled as sepsis with likely source being
   urinary vs. GI given positive urinalysis and recent instrumentation.
   E.coli identified.
   - Will continue  IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - If hypotension recurs IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Discontinued ciprofloxacin and Pip-tazo  and now on Aztreonam for
   gram negative coverage.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and  final sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count  and monitor for fevers
   .
   # Anemia
Low reticulocyte count makes hemolysis less likely.  Elevated
   LDH, T. Bili, and thrombocytopenia may be secondary to sepsis.  MCV
   WNL.  Likely chronic picture given alcohol history and poor diet.
   -Will  transfuse for Hct < 27 or hemodynamic instability
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia, unclear etiology - Continue to monitor.  D/C
   heparin SC for now.
   -f/up final HIT PF4 Ab test  results
   .
   # Transaminitis - Likely secondary to sepsis, began evolving on [**8-20**]
   prior to transfer to MICU at OSH.
   - ALT>AST, but both trending downward now, will monitor. Total
   bilirubin remains elevated, will follow resolution.
   .
   # Acute renal failure, Cr today improved from
   - 2.0 at outside hospital to 1.4 and now 1.0 Cr
   - Continue bolus IV fluids PRN
   - Renally dose meds
   .# Shortness of  breath
 multifactorial, crackles on lung exam and CXR
   showing some fluid overload and history of severe AS and has probable
   etoh withdrawal also going on as well.
   -diurese gently today with CVP 14 range and MAP 60 + so as not to
   decrease pre-load too much given severe AS shown on TTE.  Will control
   RR with Valium PRN and CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal monitoring  as
   well .
   # Aortic stenosis - Cautious with IV fluids, also caution with
   over-diuresis via Lasix
   .
   # DM-2
   - FS QID, RISS for now, holding Metformin in face of acute illness

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who presented with E. coli gram-negative sepsis from a presumed urinary source. The patient initially met the SIRS criteria with hypotension, leukopenia, and tachypnea. The source of sepsis is believed to be urinary due to positive urinalysis and recent instrumentation. The patient has been receiving IV fluids, transfusions, and antibiotics for the sepsis. Other medical conditions present include anemia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, acute renal failure, shortness of breath, aortic stenosis, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for sepsis, but ongoing monitoring and management are essential to prevent complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored to prevent further deterioration and potential need for dialysis.
3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has moderate to severe aortic stenosis. Fluid management should be cautious to avoid exacerbating this condition, and careful monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics is necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count should be monitored, and any signs of bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
   hypertension, AS who presents with E.Coli gram negative sepsis from a
   presumed urinary source.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient  initially met SIRS criteria with hypotension,
   leukopenia, tachypnea.  Now ruled as sepsis with likely source being
   urinary vs. GI given positive urinalysis and recent instrumentation.
   E.coli resistant only to quinolones identified in [**4-17**] bottles at OSH.
   - Pt appears to be volume overloaded despite the low-normal CVP. Plan
   to diurese gently using SBP as guide (keep >110), goal for today = neg
   2 L over 24 hours.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - If hypotension recurs IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Discontinued ciprofloxacin and Pip-tazo  and now on Aztreonam (Day
   1=[**2178-8-21**]) for  gram negative coverage.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and  final sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count  and monitor for fevers
   .
   # Anemia
Low reticulocyte count makes hemolysis less likely.  Elevated
   LDH, T. Bili, and thrombocytopenia may be secondary to sepsis.  MCV
   WNL.  Likely chronic picture given alcohol history and poor diet.
   -Will  transfuse for Hct < 27 or hemodynamic instability
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia, unclear etiology - Continue to monitor.  D/C
   heparin SC for now.
   -f/up final HIT PF4 Ab test  results
   .
   # Transaminitis - Likely secondary to sepsis/hypotension, began
   evolving on [**8-20**] prior to transfer to MICU at OSH.
   - ALT>AST, but both trending downward now, will monitor. Total
   bilirubin remains elevated, will follow resolution.
   .
   # Acute renal failure, Cr today improved from 2.0 at outside hospital
   to now 0.8
   -monitor Cr
   .# Shortness of  breath
 multifactorial, crackles on lung exam and CXR
   showing some fluid overload and history of severe AS and has probable
   etoh withdrawal also going on as well.
   -diurese gently today with SBP>110 so as not to decrease pre-load too
   much given severe AS shown on TTE.  Will control RR with Valium PRN and
   CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal monitoring  as well .
   # Aortic stenosis - Cautious with IV fluids, also caution with
   over-diuresis via Lasix
   .
   # DM-2
   - FS QID, RISS for now, holding Metformin in face of acute illness
   .
   # FEN:  on Diabetic diet.  Replete electrolytes PRN, hypokalemia
   corrected today, -check PM lytes

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and aortic stenosis (AS). He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock following a trans-rectal prostate biopsy. The blood and urine cultures showed E. coli resistant to quinolones, and the patient is currently on Aztreonam. He is afebrile, with a normal white blood cell count (WBC) and off all pressors. His central venous pressure (CVP) is at 7, and Lasix was continued overnight until this morning. The patient complains of right-sided chest pain that woke him up from sleep, which resolved spontaneously after 5 minutes. No other symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting were reported. An EKG was done, and cardiac enzymes were sent, showing a troponin leak of 0.15, but no elevation in CK or CK-MB.

The arterial line was pulled yesterday. The patient has allergies to sulfa and unknown allergens. He received antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin, and Aztreonam. He is currently on Famotidine and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the right-sided chest pain.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37째C (98.6째F), heart rate of 89 bpm (normal range:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of aortic stenosis (AS) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock following a trans-rectal prostate biopsy. Blood and urine cultures revealed E. coli infection resistant to quinolones, and the patient was treated with aztreonam. Currently, the patient is hemodynamically stable.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced hypertension with blood pressure reaching 160s, and borderline tachycardia with agitation. There is concern for alcohol withdrawal as the patient's wife reported that he consumes 3-4 strong vodka drinks per day. The patient was treated with valium and received a dose of 5mg PO at bedtime, which had a good effect.
- The patient's temperature was 96.9째F, heart rate was in the 80s, and blood pressure was within normal limits. He was intermittently tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 20-50 breaths per minute. The patient denied shortness of breath. He was taken off all pressors and received Lasix gtt at 0.5mg for bibasilar crackles. Crackles are still present in the lower lobes, but the patient is afebrile, tachycardia-free, and has normal blood pressure. He continues to experience tachypnea.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
   hypertension, BPH who presents with E.Coli gram negative sepsis from a
   presumed urinary source.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient  initially met SIRS criteria with hypotension,
   leukopenia, tachypnea.  Now ruled as sepsis with likely source being
   urinary vs. GI given positive urinalysis and recent instrumentation.
   E.coli identified.
   - Will continue  IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - If hypotension recurs IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Discontinued ciprofloxacin and Pip-tazo  and now on Aztreonam for
   gram negative coverage.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and  final sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count  and monitor for fevers
   .
   # Anemia
Low reticulocyte count makes hemolysis less likely.  Elevated
   LDH, T. Bili, and thrombocytopenia may be secondary to sepsis.  MCV
   WNL.  Likely chronic picture given alcohol history and poor diet.
   -Will  transfuse for Hct < 27 or hemodynamic instability
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia, unclear etiology - Continue to monitor.  D/C
   heparin SC for now.
   -f/up final HIT PF4 Ab test  results
   .
   # Transaminitis - Likely secondary to sepsis, began evolving on [**8-20**]
   prior to transfer to MICU at OSH.
   - ALT>AST, but both trending downward now, will monitor. Total
   bilirubin remains elevated, will follow resolution.
   .
   # Acute renal failure, Cr today improved from
   - 2.0 at outside hospital to 1.4 and now 1.0 Cr
   - Continue bolus IV fluids PRN
   - Renally dose meds
   .# Shortness of  breath
 multifactorial, crackles on lung exam and CXR
   showing some fluid overload and history of severe AS and has probable
   etoh withdrawal also going on as well.
   -diurese gently today with CVP 14 range and MAP 60 + so as not to
   decrease pre-load too much given severe AS shown on TTE.  Will control
   RR with Valium PRN and CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal monitoring  as
   well .
   # Aortic stenosis - Cautious with IV fluids, also caution with
   over-diuresis via Lasix
   .
   # DM-2
   - FS QID, RISS for now, holding Metformin in face of acute illness
   .
   # FEN:  Switch to regular PO diet for now.  Replete electrolytes PRN,
   hypokalemia corrected today, -check PM lytes
   .
   # Access: R subclavian, pivs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock following a trans-rectal prostate biopsy. The blood and urine cultures revealed E. coli resistant to quinolones, and he is currently being treated with Aztreonam.

The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a heart rate ranging from 79-99 bpm, blood pressure between 87-137 mmHg, respiratory rate between 24-49 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. His central venous pressure (CVP) has fluctuated between 0-13 mmHg.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's creatinine level has improved from 2.0 to 1.0 during his stay in the ICU.

Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient will continue to receive IV fluids to maintain a CVP of 8-12, and if hypotension recurs, IV fluid boluses and Levophed may be administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and urine output above 30cc/hr. The patient will be on Aztreonam for gram-negative coverage, and follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be obtained. Trends in"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
   hypertension, AS who presents with E.Coli gram negative sepsis from a
   presumed urinary source.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient  initially met SIRS criteria with hypotension,
   leukopenia, tachypnea.  Now ruled as sepsis with likely source being
   urinary vs. GI given positive urinalysis and recent instrumentation.
   E.coli resistant only to quinolones identified in [**4-17**] bottles at OSH.
   - Pt appears to be volume overloaded despite the low-normal CVP. Plan
   to diurese gently using SBP as guide (keep >110), goal for today = neg
   2 L over 24 hours.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - If hypotension recurs IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Discontinued ciprofloxacin and Pip-tazo  and now on Aztreonam for
   gram negative coverage.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and  final sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count  and monitor for fevers
   .
   # Anemia
Low reticulocyte count makes hemolysis less likely.  Elevated
   LDH, T. Bili, and thrombocytopenia may be secondary to sepsis.  MCV
   WNL.  Likely chronic picture given alcohol history and poor diet.
   -Will  transfuse for Hct < 27 or hemodynamic instability
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia, unclear etiology - Continue to monitor.  D/C
   heparin SC for now.
   -f/up final HIT PF4 Ab test  results
   .
   # Transaminitis - Likely secondary to sepsis, began evolving on [**8-20**]
   prior to transfer to MICU at OSH.
   - ALT>AST, but both trending downward now, will monitor. Total
   bilirubin remains elevated, will follow resolution.
   .
   # Acute renal failure, Cr today improved from
   - 2.0 at outside hospital to 1.4 and now 1.0 Cr
   - Continue bolus IV fluids PRN
   - Renally dose meds
   .# Shortness of  breath
 multifactorial, crackles on lung exam and CXR
   showing some fluid overload and history of severe AS and has probable
   etoh withdrawal also going on as well.
   -diurese gently today with CVP 14 range and MAP 60 + so as not to
   decrease pre-load too much given severe AS shown on TTE.  Will control
   RR with Valium PRN and CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal monitoring  as
   well .
   # Aortic stenosis - Cautious with IV fluids, also caution with
   over-diuresis via Lasix
   .
   # DM-2
   - FS QID, RISS for now, holding Metformin in face of acute illness
   .
   # FEN:  Switch to regular PO diet for now.  Replete electrolytes PRN,
   hypokalemia corrected today, -check PM lytes
   .
   # Access: R subclavian, pivs

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and aortic stenosis (AS). He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock following a trans-rectal prostate biopsy. The blood and urine cultures revealed E. coli resistant to quinolones, for which he is currently being treated with Aztreonam. The patient is now afebrile, off all pressors, and his CVP is within normal range. However, he experienced right-sided chest pain that resolved spontaneously after a few minutes. His cardiac enzymes show a Trop leak at 0.15, but no elevation in CK or CK-MB. An arterial line was pulled yesterday.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis - The patient initially met SIRS criteria with hypotension, leukopenia, and tachypnea. Now ruled as sepsis with a likely urinary source. The plan includes gentle diuresis using SBP as a guide, transfusion for Hct > 30, IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, and discontinuation of ciprofloxacin and Pip-tazo, now on Aztreonam for gram-negative coverage.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS), diabetes mellitus (DM), and heavy alcohol use. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock caused by E. coli after undergoing a trans-rectal prostate biopsy. The patient's sepsis has now resolved, but he is mildly volume overloaded and requires diuresis. He also experienced mild alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7째C (98.1째F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/69 mmHg to 137/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination revealed bibasilar crackles in the chest, soft non-tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses. The neurologic examination was not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 134 K/uL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 117 mg/dL to 165 mg/dL, and troponin T level of 0.15. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrolyte levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and diabetes mellitus (DM), who was admitted with septic shock caused by E. coli following a trans-rectal prostate biopsy. The patient's sepsis has now resolved, but he is mildly volume overloaded, requiring diuresis. Additionally, he experienced mild alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's current complaints include right-sided chest pain, tachypnea, and mild hypoxemia. His arterial line was stopped on 08/22/2178 at 05:36 PM, and an EKG was performed on 08/23/2178 at 04:15 AM. Troponin levels are within normal range, and CK is negative.

The patient has been receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, aztreonam, famotidine (Pepcid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), RISS, folate, and thiamine.

His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cardiovascular symptoms such as chest pain and tachycardia, and respiratory symptoms like tachypnea.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37째C (98.6째F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/69 mmHg to 137/79 mmHg, respiratory"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of congestive heart failure and sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU and has shown improvement in their condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory distress is primarily due to pulmonary edema, which may be caused by underlying valvular heart disease. This condition can worsen if not properly managed.

2. E. coli bacteremia: The patient had E. coli bacteremia, which has since resolved. However, there is a consideration of switching antibiotic agents to complete the course of treatment. Failure to do so could lead to a relapse of bacteremia.

3. Aortic stenosis: The patient likely has aortic stenosis, which contributed to the pulmonary edema. If not managed appropriately, this condition may lead to further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is being monitored, with a desire for a net negative balance. Inappropriate fluid management could result in fluid overload or dehydration, leading to various complications.

5. EtOH withdrawal: Although the patient does not currently have acute symptoms of EtOH withdrawal, it is still being monitored. Failure to recognize and treat withdrawal symptoms can lead to serious complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.

Overall, the patient's progress suggests improvement in their congestive"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
   hypertension, AS who presents with E.Coli gram negative sepsis from a
   presumed urinary source which is now resolving.  He also has hypoxia
   likely secondary to volume overload.
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient  initially met SIRS criteria with hypotension,
   leukopenia, tachypnea.  Now ruled as sepsis with likely source being
   urinary vs. GI given positive urinalysis and recent instrumentation.
   E.coli resistant only to quinolones identified in [**4-17**] bottles at OSH.
   Now patient afebrile, no leukocytosis, no hypotension.
   - Discontinued ciprofloxacin and Pip-tazo  and now on Aztreonam (Day
   1=[**2178-8-21**], total course 14 days) for  gram negative coverage.
   - If hypotension recurs IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and  final sputum cultures
   - Follow up cath-tip culture
   - Trend WBC count  and monitor for fevers
   # Shortness of  breath
 multifactorial, crackles on lung exam and CXR
   showing fluid overload and history of severe AS.  It is also possible
   that the patient was withdrawing from EtoH.  Tachypnea has now resolved
   and the patient is stable on 2L NC
   - Although patient is -5.7L in his stay here, he was likely given fluid
   resuscitation at OSH and so his true fluid status is unknown.  On exam
   and on CXR he appears volume overloaded.  Had good diuresis last
   night.  Plan to diurese with IV lasix, but gently due to his AS (don't
   want to decrease pre-load too much). Using SBP as guide (keep >110),
   goal for today = neg 1 L over next 24 hours.
   - Will control RR with Valium PRN and CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal
   monitoring  as well, though the patient has not been requiring this.
   # Anemia
 Now resolving.  Unlikely hemolytic given retic count
   (elevated LDH, T. Bili, and thrombocytopenia was most likely secondary
   to sepsis).  Anemia is likely chronic given alcohol history and poor
   diet.
   -Will  transfuse for Hct < 27 or hemodynamic instability
   # Thrombocytopenia, unclear etiology,probably sepsis, now resolving.
   There was concern for HIT so we D/C'd heparin SC for now.
   -f/up final HIT PF4 Ab test  results
   # Transaminitis - Likely secondary to sepsis/hypotension, began
   evolving on [**8-20**] prior to transfer to MICU at OSH.
   - ALT>AST, but both trending downward now, will monitor. Total
   bilirubin remains elevated, will follow resolution.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and aortic stenosis (AS). He was admitted with septic shock caused by E.Coli infection from a presumed urinary source, which is now resolving. The patient also has hypoxia likely secondary to volume overload. His condition has improved since admission, with resolution of fever, leukopenia, and hypotension. He is currently on Aztreonam for gram-negative coverage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. The patient's symptoms included hypotension, leukopenia, and tachypnea. Although the sepsis is now resolving, the patient needs to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and close monitoring.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, which is low oxygen levels in the blood. This can be attributed to fluid overload and possibly severe AS. The patient is stable on 2L NC (nasal cannula) for oxygen delivery, and the plan is to continue monitoring his oxygen saturation levels.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely chronic due to alcohol history and poor diet. It is now resolving, but the patient will be monitored for hemodynamic instability and transfused for Hct < 27 if necessary.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with an unclear etiology. It is likely secondary to sepsis, but there was concern for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), so heparin SC was discontinued. The final HIT PF4 Ab test results will be followed up.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is likely secondary to sepsis/hypotension. Both ALT and AST are trending downward, but total bilirubin remains elevated. Monitoring is ongoing.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels have improved from 2.0 at the outside hospital to 0.9 now, with good urine output. Monitoring of creatinine and strict I/O will continue.

7. Aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of severe AS, and caution is needed with IV fluids and over-diuresis via Lasix due to the risk of decreased preload.

8. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes, and his glycemic control should be monitored closely. Metformin is being held due to acute illness.

9. Access: The patient has had an R subclavian line pulled, and two peripheral IV lines remain in place.

10. Code status: The patient's code status is full code.

The patient's condition is stable, and he can be considered for transfer to the"
