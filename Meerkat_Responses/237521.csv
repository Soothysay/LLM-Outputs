   start taper soon
   #. Lactic Acidosis: Returned to [**Location 810**] overnight, after sharp increase
   in lactate to 7.2 immediately post-code. Likely [**12-29**] hypoperfusion in
   the setting of bradycardia and respiratory arrest. Now without anion
   gap. Low suspicion for sepsis, given negative/pending cultures,
   downtrending WBC, and afebrile state.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male admitted for recurrent syncope with hypoxic concern for pulmonary fibrosis from amiodarone in the setting of multifocal pneumonia. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to acutely worse respiratory distress requiring intubation.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including hypoxia/tachypnea, lactic acidosis, elevated CK levels, anxiety, atrial fibrillation, PSVT, anemia, orthostatic hypotension, and potential need for enteral nutrition.

From the lab results, the patient's white blood cell count is elevated but trending down, blood cultures are negative or pending, and imaging shows no pneumonia or pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 119/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and nosocomial infections. Monitoring and interventions such as continued nebs, abx, methylprednisolone for suspected amiodarone toxicity, and frequent turning and repositioning should be implemented to prevent these complications.

It is important to continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, blood glucose levels, and fluid balance. Regular assessments of sedation"

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 89F dementia, a-fib on amio, progressive lung
   ds, orthostatic hypotension/syncope admitted w/ syncope and hypoxia,
   followed by pulm and cards, likey amio lung ds had been improving with
   antibx/steroids transferred to ICU yesterday after respiratory

- The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, PSVT, orthostatic hypotension, admitted for recurrent syncope, and hypoxic concerning for pulmonary fibrosis from amiodarone in the setting of multifocal pneumonia.
- She was transferred to the MICU due to acute worsening respiratory distress requiring intubation.
- The patient's current condition is as follows:
  - Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Likely multifactorial, including suspected amiodarone toxicity, mucous plugging, and multifocal healthcare-associated pneumonia.
  - Lactic Acidosis: Returned to normal levels overnight after a sharp increase to 7.2 immediately post-code.
  - Elevated CK: CK elevated but down trending. No ischemic ECG changes. Troponin peaked at 0.04.
  - Anxiety: The patient has extreme anxiety.
  - AFIB, PSVT: Bradycardic during arrest yesterday, but in normal sinus rhythm now, on telemetry.
  - Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable at HCT of 30. The patient did have guaiac positive stool on admission.
  - Orthostatic hypotension: The patient is currently intubated and not ambulatory.
  - FEN: NPO for now, if remains intubated will start tube feeds, consider swallow study once extubated.

   Assessment and Plan
   89yof with h/o afib, PSVT, orthostatic hypotension admitted for
   recurrent syncope, with hypoxic concerning for pulm fibrosis from amio
   in setting of multifocal PNA, now transfered to MICU in setting of
   acutely worse resp distress requiring intubation.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Newly dx underlying pulmonary fibrosis changes
   thought to be secondary to amio use, and also being tx for a multifocal
   HAP PNA. Now pt has acutely worsened tachypnea that required
   intubation. It is unclear what caused this event, however, CXR is
   suggestive of aspiration event with increased opacities in the rifht
   lung. Now since intubation the pt has improved. It is unclear if the
   tachypneic episode started before or after the bradycardia started and
   if there was a cardiac component to the acute changes.
   - continue intubation overnight, wean in AM for possible extubation
   - continue nebs
   - continue abx for now- on cefepime, cipro, and vanco
   - sputum and blood cx
   - continue methylprednisolone, will need to start taper soon
   #. Leukocytosis/Lactic Acidosis: WBC of 21 from 12, and lactate that
   trended from 7.2 to 3 after the code. This is concerning for an
   infection. However, the WBC may be [**12-29**] to his large steriod dose or the
   stress of the code. Pt is afebrile, but with steriods on board pt may
   not spike a fever. Pt is being tx for HAP. Cx are so far negative.
   - trend lactate
   - trend WBC
   - continue cefepime, cipro, and vanco
   - pan culture
   - check for c. diff
   # Elevated CK: CK mildly elevated, but has been earlier in the
   admission to 400s, now in 200s. EKG with TWI in V2-V3 compared to
   prior, but otherwise no ischemic changes
   - will trend CE to r/o
   - will check EKG in AM
   - continue ASA
   - will monitor BP
   - will hold phenlyephrine
   # Bradycardia/Hypotension: Occurred in setting of resp distress and
   code. Unclear cause. Per notes, pt has hx of orthostatic hypotension
   but no report of other BP issues. Also pt has hx of bradycardia on
   holter to 50s, but this was to 30s. This was concerning for possible
   septic picture or vagel episode.
   - will monitor on tele
   - see above for tx of possible infection
   #. Anxiety: per son, this is relatively new. Pt had extreme anxiety on
   the floor.
   - Continue Prozac
   - will use midazolam/fentanyl for sedation which may calm pt since pt
   was not sedated with propofol
   #. AFIB, PSVT: No arrhythmic events on telemetry since stopping
   amiodarone. Pt is in SR.
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable at hct of 30. Pt did have guaiac
   positive stool on admission
   - will monitor
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI
   #. Orthostatic hypotension: pt currently intubated and not ambulatoruy
   - hold Florinef and phenylephrine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, PSVT, orthostatic hypotension, and anxiety. The patient was admitted for recurrent syncope and hypoxia concerning for pulmonary fibrosis from amiodarone use, as well as being treated for multifocal hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient's recent events include being transferred to the MICU due to acutely worse respiratory distress requiring intubation. The cause of this event is unclear, but a chest X-ray suggests an aspiration event with increased opacities in the right lung. Since intubation, the patient has improved. It is also unclear if the tachypneic episode started before or after the bradycardia started, and if there was a cardiac component to the acute changes.

The patient's current assessment includes several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient has acute worsening tachypnea requiring intubation. It is unclear what caused this event, but a chest X-ray suggests possible aspiration. The patient's underlying pulmonary fibrosis changes thought to be secondary to amiodarone use, as well as treatment for multifocal HAP, may contribute to the respiratory distress.

2. Leukocytosis/Lactic Acidosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated from 12 to 21, and lactate levels initially"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, PSVT, orthostatic hypotension, and recurrent syncope. She was admitted for suspected pulmonary fibrosis from amiodarone toxicity and multifocal pneumonia. She is currently in the MICU due to acute respiratory distress requiring intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of suspected amiodarone toxicity, mucous plugging, and multifocal HAP. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient is not oxygenating well on minimal vent settings, and her RSBI is good but not sufficient. Bronchoscopy may be required for airway inspection, cleanout, and additional cultures. Sputum gram stain shows >25 PMNs, culture pending.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient had an increase in lactate to 7.2 immediately post-code, likely due to [**12-29**] hypoperfusion. However, it has now resolved without anion gap. Monitoring of blood cultures and lactate levels is recommended.
4. Elevated CK: The patient's CK level is elevated but trending down. There are no ischemic ECG changes, and troponin peaked at 0.04. Further monitoring of cardiac enzymes is not necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, dementia, and chronic anemia, who presented with hypoxia and respiratory distress. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with suspected amiodarone toxicity, mucous plugging, and multifocal healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Her lactic acidosis has resolved, but she remains critically ill with an elevated white blood cell count and signs of infection. She requires mechanical ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's current treatment includes bronchoscopy for airway inspection, cleaning, and additional cultures, as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. The patient is receiving prophylactic measures, including pneumatic boots and subcutaneous heparin.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at increased risk for stress ulcers. The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis.

4. Nosocomial infections: Given the prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-related urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place.

5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

6. Hypotension: The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, which needs to be addressed while considering her current critical condition.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   89F intubated for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia. H/o AFib, on
   Amio for 6 years, orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralcorticoid
   treatments.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Her pulmonary hypertension (by Echo) and elevated
   BNP in absence of CHF c/w chronic fibrotic lung changes, which in turn
   c/w Amiodarone fibrosis
   - continue intubation overnight, SBT +/- extubation today
   - continue nebs

   - f/u sputum culture data
   - continue methylprednisolone for suspected amio toxicity, will need to
   start taper soon
   #. Lactic Acidosis: Returned to [**Location 810**] overnight, after sharp increase
   in lactate to 7.2 immediately post-code. Likely [**12-29**] hypoperfusion in
   the setting of bradycardia and respiratory arrest. Now without anion
   gap. Low suspicion for sepsis, given negative/pending cultures,
   downtrending WBC, and afebrile state.
   - do not need to trend lactate any further
   - f/u BCx
   - continue cefepime, cipro, and vanco
   - pan culture
   - check for c. diff if WBC remains elevated and pt has significant
   stool output
   # Elevated CK: CK elevated but down trending. No ischemic ECG changes.
   Troponin peaked at 0.04.
   - do not need to trend CE further
   - continue ASA
   - will monitor BP
   - will hold phenlyephrine
   #. Anxiety: per son, this is relatively new. Pt had extreme anxiety on
   the floor.
   - Continue Prozac
   - will use midazolam/fentanyl for sedation which may calm pt since pt
   was not sedated with propofol
   #. AFIB, PSVT: Bradycardic during arrest yesterday, but in normal sinus
   rhythm now, on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable at hct of 30. Pt did have guaiac
   positive stool on admission
   - will monitor
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 89F dementia, a-fib on amio, progressive lung
   ds, orthostatic hypotension/syncope admitted w/ syncope and hypoxia,
   followed by pulm and cards, likey amio lung ds had been improving with
   antibx/steroids transferred to ICU yesterday after respiratory
   near-arrest, (profound hypoxia, brady, hypotensive, never pulseless)
   now intubated.  Lactate normalized overnight.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 89-year-old female with a chief complaint of worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic anemia. The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a respiratory arrest, likely due to aspiration or mucus plug, although the exact precipitant is unclear. 

Since admission, the patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her condition remains stable with good oxygenation, but she still requires significant FiO2 and PEEP to maintain SpO2 levels. The patient's lactate levels normalized overnight, and she has shown improvement in her respiratory status. 

Further diagnostic tests and treatments are planned, including bronchoscopy for airway inspection and cleaning, additional cultures, and continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Steroids will continue for suspected amiodarone lung toxicity. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, ASA, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, methylprednisolone, and Prozac.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and catheter-related bloodstream infection. The patient's recent history of syncope and hypoxia raises concerns for potential cardiac issues such as arrhythmias or ischemic heart disease. Additionally, her chronic anemia and positive guaiac stool on admission indicate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic lung changes, currently intubated for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. She has been on amiodarone for 6 years and shows signs of possible amiodarone toxicity or pneumonia superimposed on fibrotic lung changes. The patient has leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and an elevated LDH level. She is being treated with triple antibiotics and will undergo further tests for amiodarone toxicity and possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient's anemia, orthostatic hypotension, and atrial fibrillation are also being managed accordingly. She is on tube feeds and various medications. Code status is full code. Disposition is ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, and chest X-ray showing multifocal fluffy opacities, there is a possibility of pneumonia. The presence of leukocytosis and low-grade fever supports this concern. The patient is already receiving triple antibiotics for pneumonia coverage.
2. Amiodarone toxicity: The patient's chronic lung changes and elevated BNP suggest potential amiodarone toxicity. BAL results showed no bacterial growth, and the patient's LDH level is elevated, raising suspicion for amiodarone toxicity or PCP. Further tests will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   89F intubated for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia. H/o AFib, on
   Amio for 6 years, orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralcorticoid
   treatments.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Her pulmonary hypertension and RV hypertrophy (by
   Echo) and elevated BNP in absence of CHF c/w chronic lung changes,
   which in turn c/w Amiodarone fibrosis or some other fibrotic process.
   But her chest xray opacities seem to be acutely worse as well. This
   could be an acute-on-chronic presentation, of either fluid overload or
   pneumonia superimposed on Amiodarone or other fibrotic lung changes.
   She has had mild leukocytosis and low-grade temps, and is on triple
   antibiotics for pneumonia coverage. Her BAL showed no bacteria growth.
   Her LDH is 450.
   - continue intubation overnight, SBT +/- extubation today
   - continue nebs
   - continue abx for now- on cefepime, cipro, and vanco
   - f/u sputum culture data
   - continue methylprednisolone for suspected amio toxicity, will need to
   start taper soon
   #. Lactic Acidosis: Returned to [**Location 810**] overnight, after sharp increase
   in lactate to 7.2 immediately post-code. Likely [**12-29**] hypoperfusion in
   the setting of bradycardia and respiratory arrest. Now without anion
   gap. Low suspicion for sepsis, given negative/pending cultures,
   downtrending WBC, and afebrile state.
   - do not need to trend lactate any further
   - f/u BCx
   - continue cefepime, cipro, and vanco
   - pan culture
   - check for c. diff if WBC remains elevated and pt has significant
   stool output
   # Elevated CK: CK elevated but down trending. No ischemic ECG changes.
   Troponin peaked at 0.04.
   - do not need to trend CE further
   - continue ASA
   - will monitor BP
   - will hold phenlyephrine
   #. Anxiety: per son, this is relatively new. Pt had extreme anxiety on
   the floor.
   - Continue Prozac
   - will use midazolam/fentanyl for sedation which may calm pt since pt
   was not sedated with propofol
   #. AFIB, PSVT: Bradycardic during arrest yesterday, but in normal sinus
   rhythm now, on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable at hct of 30. Pt did have guaiac
   positive stool on admission
   - will monitor
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI
   #. Orthostatic hypotension: pt currently intubated and not ambulatoruy

   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 89F dementia, a-fib on amio, progressive lung
   ds, orthostatic hypotension/syncope admitted w/ syncope and hypoxia,
   followed by pulm and cards, likey amio lung ds had been improving with
   antibx/steroids transferred to ICU yesterday after respiratory
   near-arrest, (profound hypoxia, brady, hypotensive, never pulseless)

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic lung changes who was admitted for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. She underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and was found to have no bacteria growth. Her chest X-ray showed multifocal fluffy opacities, which have worsened since admission. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. She is also on triple antibiotics, methylprednisolone for suspected amiodarone toxicity, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's chronic lung changes, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular hypertrophy, along with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), suggest chronic lung disease. The worsening chest X-ray opacities could indicate an acute-on-chronic presentation of pneumonia superimposed on amiodarone or other fibrotic lung changes. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management are required.
2. Lactic Acidosis: The patient had an increase in lactate to 7.2 immediately post-code, likely due to hypoperfusion during bradycardia and respiratory arrest. The cause of lactic acidosis is still unclear, and further investigation is needed.
3. Elevated CK: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated but trending"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralcorticoid treatments, and chronic anemia. She was admitted with worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, and a previous episode of syncope. The patient has been intubated and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient has likely multifactorial hypoxia, including suspected amiodarone toxicity, mucous plugging, and multifocal hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Her respiratory system is stable, and she has a good respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) this morning but is not oxygenating well on minimal vent settings. Her chest X-ray (CXR) is stable and possibly improved from yesterday.

2. Lactic Acidosis: The patient had a sharp increase in lactate levels immediately post-code, indicating possible hypoperfusion in the setting of bradycardia and respiratory arrest. However, her lactic acid levels have now returned to normal without anion gap, suggesting low suspicion for sepsis.

3. Elevated CK: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated but down-trending, with no evidence of ischemic ECG changes or myocardial infarction.

4. Anxiety: The patient has developed anxiety, which may be related to her recent events"

   There are lower lung volumes. Diffuse extensive bilateral opacities,
   right greater than left, centrally located are more dense than in prior
   study. These could be due to the lower lung volumes, but worsening of
   the lung abnormality can also be present. As mentioned before, these
   parenchymal opacities could be due to a combination of pulmonary edema,
   multifocal pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   89F intubated for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia. H/o AFib, on
   Amio for 6 years, orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralcorticoid
   treatments.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Not able to wean off ventilator, as PEEP/FiO2
   requirements are stable. PO2 decreasing with lower FiO2
   BUN/creatinine rising, and patient not fluid overloaded, so further
   diuresis is unlikely to beneficial. [**Month (only) 51**] have Amiodarone
   toxicity/fibrosis, as previously discussed, although steroids have not
   proven beneficial yet. Also treating for PNA, given low grade temps and
   leukocytosis.
   - continue steroids, if ultimate dx is amio toxicity she will be on
   steroids 2-6 months
   - will touch base with primary pulmonologist re: treatment for ?IPF
   - continue intubation, nebs
   - continue cefepime, cipro, and vanco
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - Vanco trough of 15-20
   - PM ABG, lytes
   #. AFIB: Continues to be in sinus rhythm off amio
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   - If develops AF, rate control with beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be partially [**12-29**] steroid effect, but need to
   consider infection, given low grade temperatures.
   - will monitor
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable at hct of 30. Pt did have guaiac
   positive stool on admission
   - will monitor
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female who is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been on amiodarone for the past 6 years. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress and hypoxia. She was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress. The patient also has a history of orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralocorticoid treatments.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 130/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 60% FiO2. The patient is sedated and unable to provide any history.

The patient has several allergies including morphine, Bactrim (oral), sulfa, and an unknown allergy to sulfa. She has received vancomycin, cefepime, and fentanyl infusions. Other medications include midazolam, lansoprazole, and furosemide.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1913 mL with 490 mL of IV fluids, 1303 mL of oral intake, and 310 mL of tube feeding. The total output includes 2294 mL of urine, 283 mL of blood products, 50 mL of NG drainage, and 207 mL of drain output. The patient's weight is currently 65."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is on amiodarone for the past 6 years. The patient also has orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralcorticoid treatments. 

On arrival, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 130/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic anemia, AFib, orthostatic hypotension, and possibly pulmonary fibrosis due to amiodarone toxicity. The patient is being treated for possible pneumonia, but the results of the BAL Gram stain show no microorganisms seen. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactic acid levels. The imaging shows diffuse extensive bilateral opacities, right greater than left, centrally located, which could be due to pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia, or worsening lung abnormality.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is on amiodarone for treatment. He also has orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralcorticoid treatments. The patient's main issue is worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia, for which he was intubated. He has not been able to wean off the ventilator due to stable PEEP/FiO2 requirements and decreasing PO2 with lower FiO2. The patient's BUN/creatinine levels are rising, and he is not fluid overloaded, so further diuresis is unlikely to be beneficial. There is a concern for amiodarone toxicity/fibrosis, as previously discussed. The patient is also being treated for pneumonia, given low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis. Other conditions include chronic anemia, leukocytosis, and orthostatic hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Amiodarone toxicity/fibrosis: The patient's lung imaging shows diffuse extensive bilateral opacities, right greater than left, centrally located, which could be due to worsening of lung abnormality or amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. Steroids have been started for this possibility.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for pneumonia, given low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis. This indicates an infection in the"

   is coiled in the stomach. Right PICC remains in place. There is no
   pneumothorax. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
   There are lower lung volumes. Diffuse extensive bilateral opacities,
   right greater than left, centrally located are more dense than in prior
   study. These could be due to the lower lung volumes, but worsening of
   the lung abnormality can also be present. As mentioned before, these
   parenchymal opacities could be due to a combination of pulmonary edema,
   multifocal pneumonia.

   which in turn c/w Amiodarone fibrosis or some other fibrotic process.
   But her chest xray opacities seem to be acutely worse as well. This
   could be an acute-on-chronic presentation, of either fluid overload or
   pneumonia superimposed on Amiodarone or other fibrotic lung changes.
   She has had mild leukocytosis and low-grade temps, and is on triple
   antibiotics for pneumonia coverage. Her BAL showed no bacteria growth.
   Her LDH of 450 raises concern for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2443**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic lung changes due to amiodarone fibrosis. She was admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 130/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is sedated and unable to provide history.

The patient has been receiving triple antibiotics for pneumonia coverage, but her BAL showed no bacterial growth. Her LDH level is elevated at 450, raising concern for PCP pneumonia. Imaging reveals diffuse extensive bilateral opacities, more dense on the right side, which could be due to pulmonary edema or multifocal pneumonia.

The patient's assessment and plan include addressing hypoxia/tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, anemia, orthostatic hypotension, and nutritional support. She is also being monitored for potential complications such as amiodarone toxicity and PCP pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU for now.

He was admitted with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been intubated due to worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 95/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's medical history includes AFib, amiodarone toxicity/fibrosis, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic anemia. He is currently being treated for presumed pneumonia, given his low-grade temperature and leukocytosis. The patient is also being monitored for AFib, leukocytosis, anemia, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic kidney disease. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated creatinine, low albumin, elevated lactate acid, elevated troponin-T, and elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with an elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) level.

   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Not able to wean off ventilator, as PEEP/FiO2
   requirements are stable. PO2 decreasing with lower FiO2
   BUN/creatinine rising, and patient not fluid overloaded, so further
   diuresis is unlikely to beneficial. [**Month (only) 51**] have Amiodarone
   toxicity/fibrosis, as previously discussed, although steroids have not
   proven beneficial yet. Also treating for PNA, given low grade temps and
   leukocytosis.
   - continue steroids, if ultimate dx is amio toxicity she will be on
   steroids 2-6 months
   - will touch base with primary pulmonologist re: treatment for ?IPF
   - continue intubation, nebs

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) on amiodarone for 6 years, presenting with worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. He is currently intubated in the ICU. His medical history includes orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralcorticoid treatments and chronic anemia. The patient is being treated for presumed pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonia, and there are concerns about amiodarone toxicity. The patient's condition is complicated by leukocytosis, acidosis, hypotension, and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia indicate ongoing respiratory failure. The need for ongoing ventilator support suggests a potential complication of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which could be exacerbated by the use of vasodilators like amiodarone.
3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for presumed pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure if not effectively managed.
5. Amiodarone Toxicity: There are concerns about the possibility of amiodarone toxicity contributing to the patient's pulmonary issues. If confirmed, this could complicate treatment decisions and long-term"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, there are several significant events that occurred within the 24-hour period.

1. Tube feeds were started.
2. The patient's medical team discussed a CT scan with the radiology department and believe that the imaging is consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic amiodarone toxicity.
3. In the evening, an arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a PO2 of 72, and the FiO2 was increased to 60%, resulting in a PO2 of 155.
4. Slow maintenance fluids were given overnight due to decreased urine output (UOP) and rising BUN/creatinine levels.
5. At 3 AM, the patient had a gas exchange of 7.28/57/74, and the ventilator settings were adjusted to assist/continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with a tidal volume (VT) of 550, respiratory rate (RR) of 22, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10. Maintenance IV fluids were continued as the patient seemed dry, and the chest X-ray (CXR) remained stable.

The patient has several allergies, including morphine, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and sulfa medications. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin and cefepime on January 7th, 20XX.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/46 to 135/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on FiO2 of 40%. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19.9 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 26.7%, and thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 313. The patient's blood glucose level is low at 52 mg/dL. The assessment and plan include hypoxia/tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, anemia, orthostatic hypotension, nutritional support, access management, and patient disposition in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, lung infection, sepsis, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, further drop in blood glucose levels, electrolyte imbalances, and potential cardiovascular events."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is on amiodarone therapy for 6 years. He also experiences orthostatic hypotension requiring mineralocorticoid treatments. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/46 to 135/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. Blood gas analysis shows pH 7.39, PaCO2 41 mmHg, SaO2 95%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 293.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 499 IU/L, elevated creatinine at 1.2 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (sodium 24 mEq/L), hypokalemia (potassium 3.4 mEq/L), and hypomagnesemia (magnesium 1.2 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient is not able to wean off the ventilator, suggesting increased PEEP. BUN/creatinine rising, and the patient is not fluid overloaded, so further diuresis is unlikely to be beneficial.
2. Amiodarone toxicity/fibrosis: The patient may have amiodarone toxicity/fibrosis, as previously discussed, although steroids have not proven beneficial yet.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for pneumonia, given low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient continues to be in sinus rhythm off amiodarone.
5. Leukocytosis: Partially attributed to steroid effect, but considering infection due to low-grade temperatures.
6. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable at Hct of 30. The patient had a guaiac positive stool on admission.
7. Orthostatic Hypotension: The patient is intubated and not ambulatory. Hold Florinef and phenylephrine for now, consider restarting when the patient ambulates.
8. Other issues: FEN tube feeds per nutrition recommendations, access lines, bowel regimen, communication with family, code status, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is reliant on mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as sepsis or worsening respiratory distress.
3. Amiodarone Toxicity/Fibrosis: The patient may develop further complications related to amiodarone toxicity/fibrosis, such as pulmonary fibrosis or worsening cardiac function.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory response.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to complications such as fatigue or decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.
6. Orthostatic Hypotension"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure as the chief complaint. The patient has been weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and antibiotics have been discontinued. The patient has multiple allergies, including morphine, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and sulfa (sulfonamides). The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin and cefepime on 01/08/2151 at 08:00 AM and 12:00 PM respectively.

The patient is currently receiving several infusions including midazolam (versed) at 2 mg/hour, fentanyl at 100 mcg/hour, and insulin - regular at 5 units/hour. Additionally, the patient is on lansoprazole (prevacid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs as of 09:55 AM on 01/09/2151 show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (100.9 Fahrenheit), heart rate of 78 beats per minute (range: 62-80 bpm), blood pressure of 112/56 mmHg (range: 72/33-135/57 mmHg), respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (range: 9-21 inspiratory/min), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is 65.9 kg, and height is 65 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,855 mL and a total output of 949 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,906 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode set at CPAP/PSV. The tidal volume (Vt) is set at 500 mL and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 17 cmH2O. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, and the patient's blood oxygen level (SpO2) is 96%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2 of 293 mmHg, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 26.7%.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears thin, has normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, and sedated mental status with no attentive response.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 26.7%, platelet (Plt) count of 313 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 84/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 658 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and sulfa medications. They have been receiving multiple IV infusions, including midazolam, fentanyl, and insulin. The patient also has heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated blood glucose. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium levels. 

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is being treated for acute respiratory failure, which may be caused by amiodarone toxicity. Steroids have been started, but there has been no significant improvement so far. Further investigations,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, hypoxia, and suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, and orthostatic hypotension. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to her inability to tolerate weaning from the ventilator. She is also receiving tube feeds for nutrition. Her vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 118/38 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for a prolonged period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility due to intubation increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation can lead to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for stress ulcer prophylaxis in ICU patients.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient is suspected to have amiodarone lung toxicity and is currently on steroids. Her recent ABG results show good oxygenation on 8 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient's family is being consulted regarding extubation and the possibility of reintubation if needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of ABG values and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. AFIB (Atrial Fibrillation): The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of AFIB. If the patient develops AFIB again, rate control with beta-blockers will be required to prevent cardiac complications.

3. Leukocytosis and Fever: The patient's rising white blood cell count and fever suggest an ongoing infection, possibly Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Empirical coverage for PCP may be considered, taking into account the patient's allergy to Bactrim.

4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels have increased with diuresis, indicating renal"

   Imaging: [**1-11**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-10**], there is

   change. Diffuse reticulonodular changes are again seen throughout both
   lungs. Again, this could reflect chronic interstitial disease, elevated
   pulmonary venous pressure, or an interstitial reaction to amiodarone as
   suggested in the clinical history. The overall opacification in the
   lungs, though prominent, is substantially less than on the study of
   [**12-31**]. This could reflect some decreasing congestion in a patient with CT
   evidence of pulmonary fibrosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   89F intubated for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, on steroids
   for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Did not tolerate decreased vent settings
   yesterday, so unable to perform SBT. Has been consistently difficult to
   wean from ventilator, despite steroid, antibiotic, diuretic therapy.
   CXR showing stable fluffy opacities, perhaps mildly increased right
   sided effusion today.
   - Continue steroids, if ultimate dx is amio toxicity she will be on
   steroids 2-6 months
   - NIF to rule out mechanical/muscular etiologies
   - Single dose furosemide, given CXR findings and improving creatinine
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - PM ABG, lytes
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be partially [**12-29**] steroid effect. No fevers
   overnight. Increased stool output. Past culture data unrevealing so
   far. Cdiff negative from yesterday.
   - f/u cultures, re culture if spikes
   #. AFIB: Continues to be in sinus rhythm off amio
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   - If develops AF, rate control with beta blocker
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine stable at 1.0. Increased
   - As above, giving small dose lasix today
   - Check PM lytes
   - Goal fluid balance: Even to negative 500 cc
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ of 5.3 yesterday. No EKG changes. Required 15 g + 30
   g of kayexelate to bring down to 4.6. Stable today at 4.3
   # Hyperglycemia: Fingersticks stable on insulin sliding scale
   - Will continue to monitor
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable in high 20
s. Hemodynamically stable.
   - will monitor daily
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI
   #. Orthostatic hypotension: pt intubated and not ambulatory
   - hold Florinef and phenylephrine  for now
   #. FEN
tube feeds per nutrition recs. Given recent cervical fracture,
   continuing Vit D, Calcium and Thiamine
   #. Access

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is intubated for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient is suspected to have amiodarone lung toxicity and is on steroids for treatment. The patient has been consistently difficult to wean from the ventilator despite steroid, antibiotic, and diuretic therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/47 to 154/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,810 mL with an intake of 966 mL through PO, 483 mL through IVF, and 362 mL through TF. The total output is 2,975 mL with 2,375 mL through urine and 200 mL through NG. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and elevated creatinine level. The imaging shows diffuse reticulonodular changes throughout both lungs, which could reflect chronic interstitial disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or an interstitial reaction to amiodarone. There are no significant changes in the microbiology reports.

   pulmonary venous pressure, or an interstitial reaction to amiodarone as
   suggested in the clinical history. The overall opacification in the
   lungs, though prominent, is substantially less than on the study of
   [**12-31**]. This could reflect some decreasing congestion in a patient with CT
   evidence of pulmonary fibrosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   89F intubated for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, on steroids
   for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Did not tolerate decreased vent settings
   yesterday, so unable to perform SBT. Has been consistently difficult to
   wean from ventilator, despite steroid, antibiotic, diuretic therapy.
   CXR showing stable fluffy opacities, perhaps mildly increased right
   sided effusion today.  NIF ruled out mechanical/muscular etiologies
   patient also noted biting tube causing mild desats.
   ** Will optimize her physical status to increase chances of extubation:
   - Continue weaning vent settings as much as tolerated
   - Will consider Presidex vs. Propofol instead of current
   Fentanyl/Versed
   - Continue steroids, if ultimate dx is amio toxicity she will be on
   steroids 2-6 months
   - Single dose furosemide, given CXR findings and improving creatinine
   (goal -1.5L)
 PM lytes
   - Position her upright for extubation, SBT trial
   - Follow-up outstanding cultures, can consider resending sputum gram
   stain/cultures
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be partially [**12-29**] steroid effect. No fevers
   overnight. Increased stool output. Past culture data unrevealing so
   far. Cdiff negative from yesterday. Increasing WBC.
   - Follow-up cultures, re-culture if spikes
   - Consider re-bronch this afternoon and sending BAL/sputum samples for
   PCP or treating empirically
   # Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~3.2L
   - Increased free water flushes and replace free water deficit
   - PM lytes
   #. AFIB: Continues to be in sinus rhythm off amio
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   - If develops AF, rate control with beta blocker
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine stable at 1.0. Increased
   - As above, giving small dose lasix today
   - Check PM lytes
   - Goal fluid balance: Even to negative 500 cc
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ of 5.3 yesterday. No EKG changes. Required 15 g + 30
   g of kayexelate to bring down to 4.6. Stable today at 4.3
   # Hyperglycemia: Fingersticks stable on insulin sliding scale. [**Month (only) 51**] bump
   with D5W.
   - Will continue to monitor
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable in high 20
s. Hemodynamically stable.
   - will monitor daily
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female who has been intubated for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. She is suspected to have amiodarone lung toxicity and is currently on steroids for this condition. The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation level. She is sedated and unable to provide any history.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral lower extremity edema and bilateral hand/upper extremity edema. Her neurological examination is not assessed due to sedation.

The patient's lab results indicate hypernatremia with a sodium level of 148 mg/dL, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, and altered liver function tests. Imaging studies show diffuse reticulonodular changes throughout both lungs, which could reflect chronic interstitial disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or an interstitial reaction to amiodarone.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Weaning failure from mechanical ventilation: The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator despite receiving steroid, antibiotic, and diuretic therapy. This suggests a possible underlying issue such as lung toxicity or chronic lung disease.

2. Pulmonary infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and previous negative sputum cultures indicate the possibility of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of suspected amiodarone lung toxicity and is being treated with steroids. His current condition is stable, but he remains difficult to wean from the ventilator. The patient has several medical complications, including leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, anemia, and orthostatic hypotension. He also has a chronic anemia that is stable at a high level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator: The patient has been consistently difficult to wean from the ventilator despite receiving steroid, antibiotic, and diuretic therapy. This could indicate ongoing respiratory distress or complications related to amiodarone lung toxicity.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's fingersticks have continued to show elevated blood sugar levels, indicating poor glycemic control. This can increase the risk of infections and other complications.
5. Anemia: The patient has a chronic anemia that is stable at a high level. Chronic an"

   Assessment and Plan
   89F intubated for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, on steroids
   for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Did not tolerate decreased vent settings
   yesterday, so unable to perform SBT. Has been consistently difficult to
   wean from ventilator, despite steroid, antibiotic, diuretic therapy.
   CXR showing stable fluffy opacities, perhaps mildly increased right
   sided effusion today.  NIF ruled out mechanical/muscular etiologies
   patient also noted biting tube causing mild desats.
   ** Will optimize her physical status to increase chances of extubation:
   - Continue weaning vent settings as much as tolerated
   - Will consider Presidex vs. Propofol instead of current
   Fentanyl/Versed
   - Continue steroids, if ultimate dx is amio toxicity she will be on
   steroids 2-6 months
   - Single dose furosemide, given CXR findings and improving creatinine
   (goal -1.5L)
 PM lytes
   - Position her upright for extubation, SBT trial
   - Follow-up outstanding cultures, can consider resending sputum gram
   stain/cultures
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be partially [**12-29**] steroid effect. No fevers
   overnight. Increased stool output. Past culture data unrevealing so
   far. Cdiff negative from yesterday. Increasing WBC.
   - Follow-up cultures, re-culture if spikes
   - Consider re-bronch this afternoon and sending BAL/sputum samples for
   PCP or treating empirically
   # Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~3.2L
   - Increased free water flushes and replace free water deficit
   - PM lytes
   #. AFIB: Continues to be in sinus rhythm off amio
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   - If develops AF, rate control with beta blocker
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine stable at 1.0. Increased
   - As above, giving small dose lasix today
   - Check PM lytes
   - Goal fluid balance: Even to negative 500 cc
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ of 5.3 yesterday. No EKG changes. Required 15 g + 30
   g of kayexelate to bring down to 4.6. Stable today at 4.3
   # Hyperglycemia: Fingersticks stable on insulin sliding scale. [**Month (only) 51**] bump
   with D5W.
   - Will continue to monitor
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable in high 20
s. Hemodynamically stable.
   - will monitor daily
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient is also on steroids for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection.

2. Pressure ulcers: The patient is immobile and at risk for developing pressure ulcers, especially in areas where there is prolonged pressure, such as the sacrum or heels.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased venous return can increase the risk of developing DVT, a blood clot in the deep veins of the legs.

4. Delirium: Prolonged sedation and immobility can lead to delirium, a disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of the environment.

5. Autonomic dysregulation: The patient has orthostatic hypotension, which may be due to autonomic dysfunction. This can lead to sudden drops in blood pressure upon standing.

6. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and increased stool output, indicating a possible infection. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out.

7. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a high potassium level, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator despite receiving steroids, antibiotics, and diuretics. The most recent chest X-ray shows stable fluffy opacities, possibly indicating a mild increase in right-sided effusion. NIF ruled out mechanical/muscular etiologies, and the patient has also been noted to bite the tube causing mild desaturation.

The assessment and plan include addressing the respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, bradycardia, anemia, and other issues. The plan involves continuing weaning of ventilator settings, considering switching sedatives, continuing steroids, administering furosemide, positioning the patient upright for extubation/SBT trial, following up on cultures, and treating empirically for PCP if necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and difficulty in weaning from the ventilator, there is a potential for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or lung infection.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has hypotension, which may indicate cardiovascular compromise. There is a potential for worsening hypotension leading to"

   Assessment and Plan
   89F intubated for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, on steroids
   for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Did not tolerate decreased vent settings
   yesterday, so unable to perform SBT. Has been consistently difficult to
   wean from ventilator, despite steroid, antibiotic, diuretic therapy.
   CXR showing stable fluffy opacities, perhaps mildly increased right
   sided effusion today.  NIF ruled out mechanical/muscular etiologies
   patient also noted biting tube causing mild desats.
   ** Will optimize her physical status to increase chances of extubation:
   - Continue weaning vent settings as much as tolerated
   - Will consider Presidex vs. Propofol instead of current
   Fentanyl/Versed
   - Continue steroids, if ultimate dx is amio toxicity she will be on
   steroids 2-6 months
   - Single dose furosemide, given CXR findings and improving creatinine
   (goal -1.5L)
 PM lytes
   - Position her upright for extubation, SBT trial
   - Follow-up outstanding cultures, can consider resending sputum gram
   stain/cultures
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be partially [**12-29**] steroid effect. No fevers
   overnight. Increased stool output. Past culture data unrevealing so
   far. Cdiff negative from yesterday. Increasing WBC.
   - Follow-up cultures, re-culture if spikes
   - Consider re-bronch this afternoon and sending BAL/sputum samples for
   PCP or treating empirically
   # Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~3.2L
   - Increased free water flushes and replace free water deficit
   - PM lytes
   #. AFIB: Continues to be in sinus rhythm off amio
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   - If develops AF, rate control with beta blocker
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine stable at 1.0. Increased
   - As above, giving small dose lasix today
   - Check PM lytes
   - Goal fluid balance: Even to negative 500 cc
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ of 5.3 yesterday. No EKG changes. Required 15 g + 30
   g of kayexelate to bring down to 4.6. Stable today at 4.3
   # Hyperglycemia: Fingersticks stable on insulin sliding scale. [**Month (only) 51**] bump
   with D5W.
   - Will continue to monitor
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable in high 20
s. Hemodynamically stable.
   - will monitor daily
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI
   #. Orthostatic hypotension: pt intubated and not ambulatory
   - hold Florinef and phenylephrine  for now
   #. FEN

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient is suspected to have amiodarone lung toxicity and is being treated with steroids. She has been difficult to wean from the ventilator, and her condition has not improved despite antibiotic, diuretic therapy, and steroid treatment. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/50-155/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.7-22.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, and hypernatremia with a sodium level of 140-153 mg/dL. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.0, and she has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 4.3-5.3 mEq/L. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of LDH, CK, troponin-T, and C-reactive protein.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia have led to the need for mechanical ventilation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes a cervical fracture, chronic anemia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and orthostatic hypotension. He is also on steroids for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity.

Over the past 24 hours, several interventions have been made. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and stool culture. His serum sodium level has improved from 150 to 140. Sedation was changed from Fentanyl/Versed to Precedex. The goal of diuresis is 500-1000 cc, but it appears that this goal has not been achieved. 

The patient's vital signs remain stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/50-155/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is still receiving IV fluids and has a positive fluid balance. He is also receiving nutrition through tube feeds and has been prescribed medications such as dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, and heparin.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 20.7-22.5 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, elevated potassium level of 153 mg/dL, low sodium level of 135-140 mEq/L, and normal creatinine level of 1.0-1.1 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate possible infection and inflammation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient is stable on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and desires extubation. A chest X-ray is stable, ruling out mechanical or muscular etiologies. Follow SBT and consider extubation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has increasing white blood cell count, possibly due to steroid effect. Follow-up cultures are pending.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level has resolved, so D5W infusion should be discontinued.
4. AFIB: The patient continues to be in sinus rhythm off amiodarone. Continue telemetry and continue ASA 325 mg. If the patient develops AF, rate control with a beta-blocker should be considered.
5. [Last Name (un)]: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.0. Furosemide should be continued, and fluid balance should be monitored.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's fingersticks are stable on insulin sliding scale. Monitor closely.
7. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia but is hemodynamically stable. Monitor daily and continue Fe supplementation.
8. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient is int"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was previously intubated but was extubated due to improved oxygen saturation and ability to clear secretions. The patient's condition appears to be improving, as indicated by a decrease in ventilator support and increased spontaneous breathing. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia - The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and it is important to monitor for any worsening of symptoms or infection.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - Although the note mentions that the patient does not have ARDS, it is still important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status.
3. Hypotension - The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Leukocytosis - The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a potential infection or inflammatory response.
5. Acidosis, metabolic - The patient has an elevated bicarbonate level, indicating a metabolic acidosis, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Pulmonary fibrosis - The patient has a history of pulmonary fibrosis, and it is important to monitor for any worsening of this condition.
7. Bradycardia - The patient has a low heart rate, which should be monitored, especially during episodes of hypotension or medication administration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, and suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity. The patient was intubated but successfully extubated. He is currently on invasive ventilation with an aerosol face mask and receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's condition is stable with improved oxygen saturation levels. However, he is experiencing some complications such as leukocytosis, anemia, hyperglycemia, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is also being treated for possible Clostridium difficile infection, which has been ruled out. The plan is to continue steroids at a low dose, monitor electrolytes, provide close suctioning of secretions, and follow-up with cultures.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may recur if reintubation becomes necessary.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or a response to steroid treatment.
3. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may require further investigation and management.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels should be monitored closely, especially during tube feeding resumption.
5. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient's inability to ambulate poses a risk for falls and potential complications related to orthostatic hypotension.
6. Chronic kidney disease"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient is suspected to have Amiodarone lung toxicity and is currently intubated. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), blood pressure ranging from 142/47-168/127 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.6-22.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels, and various electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows widespread parenchymal opacities on chest X-ray, but the NG tube tip is in the stomach. Microbiology tests are pending. 

The patient's medical conditions include hypoxia/tachypnea, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, hyperglycemia, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently receiving steroids for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity, diuretics for fluid management, and antibiotics for potential infection. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (D"

   Assessment and Plan
   89F intubated for worsening respiratory distress, hypoxia, on steroids
   for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity.
   #. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Patient stable after extubation. Desaturates when
   off facemask
   - Continue steroids at 1mg/kg/day X2-6 months
   - C/w furosemide bolus, goal of 1 L negative
   - Check PM lytes
   - C/w upright positioning when possible, close suctioning of
   secretions, monitoring gag
   - Will try to wean off aerosol face mask  to nasal cannula gradually
   - Follow-up outstanding cultures, sputum negative
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be partially [**12-29**] steroid effect. Low grade temp
   99.4 yesterday morning. Past culture data unrevealing so far. Cdiff
   negative. WBC stably high.
   - Follow-up cultures, re-culture if spikes
   #. AFIB: Continues to be in sinus rhythm off amio x 1 week
   - Continue telemetry
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   # Psychosocial: Increasing patient frustration with medical
   interventions and checks, including lab draws, physical exams, turning,
   etc.
   - Will have family meeting today to discuss with family re: Code
   Status, goals of care
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine stable at 0.8
   - Furosemide as above
   - PM lytes
   # Hyperglycemia: Fingersticks slightly labile
   - Will continue to monitor closely on tubefeeds
   #. Anemia: Chronic anemia, stable in high 20s. Hemodynamically stable.
   - Will monitor daily
   - Continue Fe supplementation
   - continue home PPI
   #. Orthostatic hypotension: Patient still not ambulatory

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been intubated and is on steroids for suspected Amiodarone lung toxicity. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has several medical complications including leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, anemia, hyperglycemia, orthostatic hypotension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's family has requested a full code status and a family meeting is planned for later today to discuss goals of care. The patient is currently receiving tube feeds and has multiple lines and prophylactic medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and hypoxia may indicate a potential respiratory complication. This could be due to Amiodarone toxicity or another underlying condition.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events. Close monitoring of cardiac status is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia could be a result of ongoing blood loss or decreased production of red blood cells. Regular monitoring and evaluation for underlying causes are required.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's labile"
