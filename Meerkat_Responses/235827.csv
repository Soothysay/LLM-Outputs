   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Did diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis on floor. Will
   treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given recent
   hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures; may have skin flora in ascitic fluid
   given recent peritoneal catheter.  Ascites [**Numeric Identifier 9116**] WBCs, 93% PMNs, [**Numeric Identifier 9117**]
   RBCs. Consistent with SBP.  Given history of diarrhea as well will send
   stool for C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other
   infectious eitologies. Was receiving aggressive fluid rehydration which
   does not appear to have improved his clinical picture at all and
   patient not currently hypotensive; additionally, CXR this AM consistent
   with mild pulmonary edema.
   - D/c IVF, if hypotensive will plan to reinstitute volume repletion
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -Liver plans for EGD, Colonoscopy once stabilized
   -T& S active
   -Octreotide gtt
   -Protonix IV BID
   -Zofran, NG Tube
   -HCT q4 hours
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Patient has significantly elevated K+. EKG shows no
   evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Patient is
   on calcium for membrane stabilization. Kayexelate given x2. In the
   setting of oliguria will consult renal as hyperkalemia may be an
   indication for dialysis in this patient.
   -Kayexelate
   -K+ q4 hours
   -Renal consult
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. [**Month (only) 11**] be because patient has no hepatic
   function to clear lactate. Also could possibly be secondary to bowel
   ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet perforated,
   but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this morning from
   exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO contrast
   -Surgery consult
 agree with CT scan, feel that ischemia unlikely,
   will continue to follow
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased. Creatinine significantly increased from baseline, at
   baseline 0.7-1, today Cr 4.3. [**Month (only) 11**] have prerenal element secondary to
   hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with
   prerenal eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion.
   Patient has received 6L NS (in addition to 1.5L in the ED), 4 units
   FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose. Not improving with aggressive fluids, making
   hepatorenal higher on differential.
   -Consult renal, may need dialysis
   -D/c IVF as above given pulmonary edema
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant.
   -Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute worsening (Doppler,
   ect)
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   .
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   .
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   .
   #Hypocalcemia: Giving calcium for hyperkalemia
   #Hyponatremic: Patient appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving.
   -Make sure medications given in saline not water
   -Once no longer NPO consider free water restriction
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Renagel TID
   .
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen: Lactulose

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, potential spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, and potential hepatorenal syndrome. He is currently in the ICU receiving aggressive treatment for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including tachycardia, elevated WBC count, tachypnea, and elevated lactate levels indicating tissue hypoperfusion.
2. SBP: The patient's ascitic fluid analysis shows 93% PMNs and 17 RBCs, which are consistent with SBP. This is a potential complication in patients with ESLD.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has significantly elevated potassium levels. This can be dangerous and may require urgent treatment to prevent cardiac complications.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a significantly elevated lactate level, indicating metabolic acidosis. This may be secondary to tissue hypoperfusion or bowel ischemia.
5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is low despite aggressive fluid"

   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. [**Month (only) 11**] be because patient has no hepatic
   function to clear lactate. Also could possibly be secondary to bowel
   ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet perforated,
   but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this morning from
   exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO contrast
   -Surgery consult

   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased. Creatinine significantly increased from baseline, at
   baseline 0.7-1, today Cr 4.3. [**Month (only) 11**] have prerenal element secondary to
   hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with
   prerenal eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion.
   Patient has received 6L NS (in addition to 1.5L in the ED), 4 units
   FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose. Not improving with aggressive fluids, making
   hepatorenal higher on differential.
   -Consult renal, may need dialysis

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic in the setting of no SBP prophylaxis, and is currently hypotensive. The patient has significantly elevated WBC count (>12), tachycardic, and elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue hypoperfusion. He also has elevated INR and evidence of hyperkalemia. The patient's abdomen is soft, distended, and tender with shifting dullness, consistent with ascites. He has decreased bowel sounds and evidence of mild pulmonary edema on CXR.

The patient is being treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn due to recent hospitalization and potential skin flora in ascitic fluid. Diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis was performed, revealing 93% PMNs, consistent with SBP. He also has a history of diarrhea, so stool for C.diff will be sent.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Did diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis on floor. Will
   treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given recent
   hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures; may have skin flora in ascitic fluid
   given recent peritoneal catheter.  Ascites [**Numeric Identifier 9116**] WBCs, 93% PMNs, [**Numeric Identifier 9117**]
   RBCs. Consistent with SBP.  Given history of diarrhea as well will send
   stool for C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other
   infectious eitologies. Was receiving aggressive fluid rehydration which
   does not appear to have improved his clinical picture at all and
   patient not currently hypotensive; additionally, CXR this AM consistent
   with mild pulmonary edema.
   - D/c IVF, if hypotensive will plan to reinstitute volume repletion
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.

   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. [**Month (only) 11**] be because patient has no hepatic
   function to clear lactate. Also could possibly be secondary to bowel
   ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet perforated,
   but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this morning from
   exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO contrast
   -Surgery consult
 agree with CT scan, feel that ischemia unlikely,
   will continue to follow

   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased. Creatinine significantly increased from baseline, at
   baseline 0.7-1, today Cr 4.3. [**Month (only) 11**] have prerenal element secondary to
   hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with
   prerenal eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion.
   Patient has received 6L NS (in addition to 1.5L in the ED), 4 units
   FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose. Not improving with aggressive fluids, making
   hepatorenal higher on differential.
   -Consult renal, may need dialysis
   -D/c IVF as above given pulmonary edema
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.

   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures.

   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT actually roughly at baseline, currently 29.9, previous

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena and sepsis in the setting of no SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) prophylaxis. The patient has tachycardia, significantly elevated WBC count (>12), tachypnea, and elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue hypoperfusion. He is suspected to have developed sepsis, likely due to SBP given the presence of a peritoneal catheter and lack of SBP prophylaxis. The patient is already on empiric antibiotic treatment and has undergone a diagnostic paracentesis due to elevated INR. Stool for C.diff has been sent, and a chest X-ray was performed to rule out other infectious etiologies. The patient is being treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn.

The patient also has signs of a GI bleed, possibly variceal bleeding, as evidenced by coffee ground emesis and melena. He has been experiencing this for several days, and there is orthostasis present. Upper GI tract bleeding is the most likely source given the coffee ground emesis and melena. The patient's HCT is at baseline, but may not reflect the acute bleed. Plans for EGD and colonoscopy once stabilized have been made.

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena and sepsis in the setting of no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis. The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding (most likely variceal bleed), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing signs of systemic infection, such as tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels. Immediate treatment with empiric antibiotics is necessary.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's presentation of coffee ground emesis/melena and orthostasis suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from varices given his history of ESLD. Further evaluation with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is needed to confirm the source of bleeding.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has significantly elevated potassium levels. EKG monitoring and administration of calcium gluconate for membrane stabilization are required. Kayexalate may also be given to decrease potassium levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures; may have skin flora in
   ascitic fluid given recent peritoneal catheter.  Ascites [**Numeric Identifier 9116**] WBCs,
   93% PMNs, [**Numeric Identifier 9117**] RBCs. Consistent with SBP.
   -Paracentesis done
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -Liver plans for EGD, Colonoscopy once stabilized

   #Hyperkalemia: Patient has significantly elevated K+. EKG shows no
   evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Patient is
   on calcium for membrane stabilization. Will give kayexalate as well to
   decrease K+
   -Kayexelate
   -EKG in AM
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. Also could possibly be secondary to
   bowel ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet
   perforated, but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this
   morning from exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO/IV contrast
   -Surgery consult
 agree with CT scan, feel that ischemia unlikely
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased. Creatinine significantly increased from baseline, at
   baseline 0.7-1, today Cr 4.3. [**Month (only) 11**] have prerenal element secondary to
   hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with
   prerenal eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion.
   Patient has received 6L NS (in addition to 1.5L in the ED), 4 units
   FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose.
   -Aggressive hydration
   -If not improving with aggressive hydration, consider hepatorenal
   syndrome, will need albumin
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, septic shock, and no SBP prophylaxis. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding for several days, orthostasis, and elevated WBC count (>12), indicating a likely infection. He also has elevated lactate levels, suggesting tissue hypoperfusion. The patient was started on empiric antibiotic treatment in the ED and received paracentesis, which showed ascites with 93% PMNs, consistent with SBP. He is currently on octreotide, pantoprazole, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, tachycardia, tachypnea, and elevated lactate indicate sepsis, likely secondary to SBP. The source of infection is the ascitic fluid, as evidenced by the presence of ascites with 93% PMNs.
2. GI bleed: The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding for several days, with coffee ground emesis/melena. The bleeding source is suspected to be variceal, given the patient's history of ESLD and the presence of orthostasis.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a significantly elevated lactate level,"

There is also a possibility of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding due to the presence of coffee ground emesis and melanotic stool. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been trending down, indicating potential ongoing bleeding or dilutional effect.

The patient has elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), lactate, and potassium. His EKG shows no evidence of hyperkalemia. The patient is on calcium for membrane stabilization and will receive kayexalate to decrease potassium levels.

The patient has metabolic acidosis, which initially was thought to be secondary to tissue hypoperfusion due to sepsis. However, it has not improved with aggressive fluids, raising suspicion of bowel ischemia. A CT scan with PO/IV contrast is planned to further evaluate this possibility. Surgery consultation may also be considered.

The patient is oliguric, with a bladder pressure of 17 after paracentesis but without significant improvement in urine output. The patient may have prerenal azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome. He has received aggressive hydration, including 4 liters of"

   Assessment and Plan
   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Patient tachycardic, significantly elevated WBC count (>12),
   tachypnic, and has elevated lactate indicating most likely tissue
   hypoperfusion. [**Hospital1 69**] labs from [**9-20**] WBC count 37 with 14% bands, in ED
   WBC count 36. Most likely source is SBP given that patient had
   peritoneal catheter in place until recently, not on SBP prophylaxis.
   Patient started on empiric antibiotic treatment in ED given elevated
   WBC count. No clear history of fevers from patient, patient afebrile
   since arrival. Diagnostic paracentesis not done in ED because of
   elevated INR. Given history of diarrhea as well will send stool for
   C.diff. Also pancultured and obtained CXR to rule out other infectious
   eitologies. Will treat empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn given
   recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 69**] exposures.
   -Paracentesis done
   -Vancomycin and Zosyn
   -C. diff
   -Blood and urine cultures pending
   #. GI bleed: Per patient, has been experiencing this for several days,
   also having orthostasis. Given history, strong suspicion for variceal
   bleed. Most likely patient has slow bleed given that per his history
   this has been going on for several days. As patient also has elevated
   INR other sources of bleeding along upper GI tract also possible; upper
   source most likely given that he has coffee ground emesis and melanotic
   stool.  HCT trended down from admission, 29.9
 24.8 this morning, most
   likely dilutional as patient is not currently displaying evidence of
   active bleeding.
   -Liver plans for EGD, Colonoscopy once stabilized
   -T& S active
   -Octreotide gtt
   -Protonix IV BID
   -Zofran, NG Tube
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Patient has significantly elevated K+. EKG shows no
   evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Patient is
   on calcium for membrane stabilization. Will give kayexalate as well to
   decrease K+
   -Kayexelate
   -EKG in AM
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient has a significantly elevated lactate, on
   arrival 6.8, trended down to 6.1, then this morning trending back up,
   6.3. Metabolic acidosis not improving. Initially thinking that most
   likely secondary to tissue hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis. Has not
   improved with aggressive fluids. Also could possibly be secondary to
   bowel ischemia. KUB shows no evidence of free air so has not yet
   perforated, but may still have ischemia. Bowel sounds decreased this
   morning from exam on admission.
   -CT scan with PO/IV contrast
   -Consider surgery consult
   .
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. However, urine output has not significantly
   increased.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have prerenal element secondary to hypovolemia or
   hepatorenal syndrome. FENa 0.29%, more consistent with prerenal
   eitiologies. In setting of sepsis likely hypoperfusion. Patient has
   received 4L NS, 4 units FFP, albumin 5%x1 dose.
   -Aggressive hydration
   #.Coagulopathy: Patient's INR elevated at 4.3, at [**Hospital1 69**] on [**9-20**] it was
   5.3. Now at 3 with 4 units FFP. INR is significantly higher than his
   baseline. [**Month (only) 11**] represent acute worsening of his chronic ESLD. [**Month (only) 11**] also
   have a component of malnutrition as patient reports poor appetite
   recently. Unlikely to represent DIC in setting of sepsis as his
   fibrinogen is normal.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant.
   -Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute worsening
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   .
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   .
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   .
   #Hypocalcemia: Repleting  as needed
   .
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient exhibits signs of systemic infection, such as tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count, tachypnea, and elevated lactate levels. This indicates tissue hypoperfusion and possible organ dysfunction.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing GI bleeding for several days, with coffee ground emesis and melena. This could be due to variceal bleeding, especially considering his history of ESLD. Other sources of bleeding, including an upper GI tract bleed, are also possible.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has significantly elevated potassium levels, which can be dangerous for cardiac function. However, the EKG shows no evidence of cardiac instability secondary to hyperkalemia. Calcium is being administered for membrane stabilization, and Kayexalate will be given to help decrease potassium levels.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a significantly elevated lactate level, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. Initially thought to be secondary to sepsis, it has not improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Bowel ischemia is also a possibility, as the patient's"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena and is septic, with no small bowel perforation (SBP) prophylaxis. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient appears more lethargic and confused, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition occurs when the liver is unable to adequately remove toxins from the blood, leading to cognitive dysfunction.

2. GI Bleed: The patient likely has a gastrointestinal bleed from varices, as indicated by the elevated INR and decreasing hemoglobin levels. Variceal bleeding is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis.

3. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic and has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating ongoing infection. Sepsis can develop due to the compromised immune system in patients with ESLD.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a significant metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap. This can occur in patients with liver dysfunction due to the accumulation of acidic substances.

5. Oliguria: The patient has poor urine output despite fluid resuscitation, suggesting pre-renal azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome. Oliguria is a common complication in advanced liver disease"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena and sepsis in the setting of no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/50 mmHg to 110/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse mild bowel wall thickening likely secondary to third spacing in the setting of large volume ascites and anasarca. There is also nodular cirrhotic liver with patent portal and hepatic venous systems, large-volume ascites, and no focal liver lesions. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding likely from varices, as indicated by the elevated INR and trend towards anemia. Additionally, the patient has hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, ESLD, ascites, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated hemoglobin levels, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), decreased"

   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down
   from 21.8 yesterday to 18.3 today. Staph aureus coag + growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Patient will need TEE today to determine if there
   is seeding of valve to determine length of antibiotics.
   Vancomycin level 22.4. C. diff negative.
   --Continue Vancomycin today is day#3.
   -- Hold today
s vancomycin dose, recheck level tomorrow morning.
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Get sputum Cx
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears more lethargic and somewhat
   confused this am. Tbili and LFT
s are also acutely increased
   --NGT and will need Lactulose today
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
   --Touch base with liver about plans for procedure
   --T&S active until [**9-23**]
   --Has 1U crossmatched currently, if transfused another would need 2U
   more crossed
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q4hrs today
   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets this pm and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 16 this am, trending down from 20's,
   without fluid resuscitation, only significant intervention being
   antibiotics. Lactate also significantly down 2.9 from high 6's on
   admission. CT scans cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical
   picture is improving.
   --Continue to trend ABG's and chemistry panel to ensure closure of gap.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. UOP still remains poor through yesterday.
   Pre-renal due to hypovolemia (however, pt received 7.5L NS and was not
   responsive) vs hepatorenal syndrome.
   --Consult renal, may need dialysis today as pt continues to be
   acidotic.
   --Would try fluid resuscitation with blood products as needed for
   volume replacement first, then boluses of NS prn
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome, have ordered but pt
   may not be able to take [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need tube placement if continued poor
   PO intake.
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Patient is being worked up for transplant per Dr.[**Name (NI) 9100**] clinic
   notes. MELD currently 46. Liver team is following. Patient was supposed
   to see social worker on [**10-7**] to further evaluate suitability for
   transplant. Abdominal ultrasound to assess for causes of acute
   worsening (Doppler, ect)
   --F/u with liver re: overall goals of care from liver standpoint.
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hypocalcemia: Giving calcium for hyperkalemia
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving.

   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down
   from 21.8 yesterday to 18.3 today. Staph aureus coag + growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Patient will need TEE today to determine if there
   is seeding of valve to determine length of antibiotics.  CXR yesterday
   shows very large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. CXR
   today seems slightly improved. Patient continues to have appropriate O2
   sats, lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated. Would cover with
   vanco, given that we now know it is staph can d/c zosyn and start cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.  Vancomycin level 22.4. C. diff negative.
   --Consult ID for + blood cultures
   --TEE Monday most likely or earlier if intubated
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Continue Vancomycin today is day#3, course per ID recs depending also
   if seeded valves .
   -- Hold today
s vancomycin dose, recheck level afternoon.
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Get sputum Cx
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears more lethargic and somewhat
   confused this am. LFTs currently trending down again after being
   acutely elevated yesterday; may have been elevated yesterday secondary
   to irritation from large pleural effusion. T. Bili trending up today.
   --NGT given lactulose, lactulose just increased
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
   --T&S active until [**9-23**]
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am, increased slightly. CT scans
   cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is
   improving.
   --Would recheck lactate.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --1 g albumin per liver & renal recs
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking.
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving as patient NPO.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient at his personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) though trending down today. Would check PM platelets.
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamir TID
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. The patient presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and no small bowel prophylaxis.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to the presence of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive bacteria in the blood and peritoneal fluid. This indicates a bacterial infection that needs to be addressed promptly.

2. Gastrointestinal bleed (melena, GI bleed, GIB): The patient is experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from varices or gastropathy. The elevated INR and decreasing hemoglobin levels suggest ongoing blood loss.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and confusion are indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition where liver dysfunction leads to cognitive impairment.

4. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with a gap of 22, which could be due to various causes such as lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis.

5. Oliguria/anuria: The patient initially had oliguria (reduced urine output) but is improving. The cause of this could be pre-renal hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or acute tubular nec"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and no small bowel prophylaxis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis without organ dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleed (melena), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic viral hepatitis, ascites, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient appears lethargic and somewhat confused, which could be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status and should be managed by administering lactulose and rifaximin.

2. Sepsis: The patient is still tachycardic and has an elevated WBC count, indicating ongoing infection. The most likely source of infection is the peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum. TEE is recommended to determine if there is seeding of valves to determine the length of antibiotics.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient likely has a gastrointestinal bleed, possibly from varices or gastropathy. INR is elevated, and Hct is trending down. Further investigation and management are required, including EGD/colonos"

   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down
   from 21.8 yesterday to 18.3 today. Staph aureus coag + growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Patient will need TEE today to determine if there
   is seeding of valve to determine length of antibiotics.  CXR yesterday
   shows very large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
   Concern is if possible pneumonia could be beneath. Patient continues to
   have appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated.
   Would be covering as is with vanco and zosyn.
   Vancomycin level 22.4. C. diff negative.
   --Continue Vancomycin today is day#3.
   -- Hold today
s vancomycin dose, recheck level tomorrow morning.
   --F/u cultures for sensitivities
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Get sputum Cx
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears more lethargic and somewhat
   confused this am. LFTs currently trending down again after being
   acutely elevated yesterday; may have been elevated yesterday secondary
   to irritation from large pleural effusion. T. Bili trending up today.
   --NGT given lactulose, lactulose just increased
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U
   PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 25.9.
   Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy once stabilized.
   --T&S active until [**9-23**]
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q6hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Would start Vitamin K x3d
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am, increased slightly. CT scans
   cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is
   improving.
   --Would recheck lactate.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely, continuing to
   follow, appreciate recs.
   #Oliguria: Patient had bladder pressure of 22 on admit, 17 after
   paracentesis removing 2L. UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to
   hypovolemia (however, pt received 7.5L NS and was not responsive) vs
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Recommended albumin for treatment of hepatorenal.
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC. Vitamin K given for 3 days yesterday.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking.
   #Ascites: Patient currently hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and
   Lasix.
   #DM: Patient currently NPO
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 2.3, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Hyponatremic: Pt appeared hypovolemic on admission, hypovolemic
   hyponatremia most likely due to the fact that patient was significantly
   volume depleted, trying to replace lost fluid by drinking water.
   Currently improving as patient NPO.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient at his personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) though trending down today. Would check PM platelets.
   #Hyperphosphatemia: Sevelamir TID
   FEN: NPO as actively bleeding

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant medical history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and no small bowel prophylaxis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleed (likely from varices or gastropathy), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria/anuria, coagulopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic viral hepatitis, ascites, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hypoalbuminemia.

The patient's current condition includes being lethargic and somewhat confused, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. His liver function tests are trending down after being acutely elevated yesterday, which may have been secondary to irritation from a large pleural effusion. He has a rising total bilirubin level.

The patient is also experiencing a gastrointestinal bleed, likely from varices or gastropathy. His INR is elevated and has been creeping back up, and his hematocrit is trending down. He has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday with an appropriate bump in hematocrit but is still low at 25.9%. Plans for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy once stabilized have been made.

The patient is also dealing with"

   elevated WBC count although trended down today from 35 to 21, elevated
   lactate although also trending down, and acidotic with AG 15 although
   this is also trending down. Although Gstain negative likely source is
   SBP given 11k WBC's from para. Pt continues to be afebrile.

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history significant for end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and ethanol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis in the setting of no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis, and a likely gastrointestinal bleed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient appears more lethargic and somewhat confused this morning. Liver function tests (LFTs) are also acutely increased. NG tube placement and lactulose administration are recommended.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Follow up Vanc level and adjust accordingly. No evidence of infectious source elsewhere. Re-Cx if spikes temperature. If continued hypoTN, first go with blood products as necessary, then NS, but is anuric and may volume overload him.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: Likely from varices. INR is elevated and has been creeping back up. Hct also trending down and received 1U PRBC's yesterday with appropriate bump in Hct but still low at 23. Liver plans for esophagogastroduodenoscopy/colonoscopy once stabilized.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena and sepsis in the setting of no SBP prophylaxis.
2. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia/peritonitis secondary to a PD catheter. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and the patient's WBC count is decreasing.
3. The patient is also experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which is improving with lactulose.
4. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from varices or gastropathy. INR is elevated, and the patient received a blood transfusion. Further plans for endoscopy are being made.
5. The patient is dealing with metabolic acidosis, with a gap of 22 this morning. CT scans cannot rule out gut ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving.
6. The patient has oliguria/anuria, with pre-renal causes due to hypovolemia vs hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN. Albumin has been given, and renal function is being closely monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history significant for end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. The patient presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and no small bowel prophylaxis. He is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic with an elevated white blood cell count, which is trending down. Staphylococcus aureus coag positive is growing from blood and peritoneal fluid, most likely due to the peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [Last Name (LF)] and [First Name3 (LF) 116]. The patient needs aggressive treatment with a four-week course of antibiotics as recommended by the ID team. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The patient is already receiving appropriate oxygen saturation, lung bases are dull but no crackles are appreciated. Nafcillin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin have been started for prophylaxis.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient appears less confused this morning. Liver function tests (LFTs) are currently trending down again after being acutely elevated yesterday, which may have been due to irritation from a large pleural effusion. Total bilirubin is trending up today. Lactul"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a significant medical history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and no small bowel perforation (SBP) prophylaxis. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, tachycardia, and is on mechanical ventilation. Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive is growing from blood and peritoneal fluid, suggesting a possible source of infection in the peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum. Vegetations are observed on the last name and first name 3. The patient's current condition includes hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis without organ dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleed, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, ESLD/ascites, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypocalcemia, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome if not treated aggressively.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient shows signs of confusion, which may worsen if not managed properly with lactulose and rifaximin.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has coffee ground emesis/melena, indicating an ongoing bleed. Variceal ligation"

   49M with PMHx significant for ESLD secondary to hepatitis C and EtOH
   abuse who presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, also septic in
   setting of no SBP prophylaxis. Abdominal pain today.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from blood and
   peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding
   peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with
   4wk course per ID.  Patient may need TEE to confirm, but that has
   significant risks.   Patient continues to have appropriate O2 sats,
   lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated. Started nafacillin, zosyn
   d/c'd, cipro started for prophylaxis.
   --Nafacillin for staph aureus in blood and peritoneal fluid
   --TEE [**First Name3 (LF) 305**] possibly with EGD
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Will need repeat paracentesis [**First Name3 (LF) 305**]
   --F/u ID recs
   #Abdominal Pain: Patient appears in a fair amount of pain this morning,
   reports that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus,
   bowel sounds present but decreased, doesn
t have an acute abdomen
   making perforation unlikely.
   --KUB to assess for perforation
   --Morphine as needed for pain control
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated on [**9-22**]; may
   have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large pleural
   effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy most likely
   on [**Month/Day (1) 305**].
   --T&S active
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Tachycardia: Patient had one episode of tachycardia yesterday.
   Resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses. Patient was significantly
   negative prior to episode of tachycardia, may have been secondary to
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have been pain. Became sinus after fluids and
   lopressor. No signs of acute bleeding, HCT was not decreased.
   --Continue to monitor
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am. CT scans cannot rule out gut
   ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely
   --F/u renal recommendations
   #Oliguria: UOP decreasing today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Will check bladder pressure to ensure that patient does not need
   therapeutic paracentesis.
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD/Ascites: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking. Patient currently
   hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and Lasix.
   #DM: Patient receiving TF, on insulin s/s
   -insulin S/S
   #HTN: Patient currently hypotensive; holding home meds
   #.Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin 3.1, most likely secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction.
   -Albumin with paracentesis
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient
s personal baseline (from prior
   hospitalization) 40s-50s. Today 26. Would check PM platelets.

   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from blood and
   peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding
   peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with
   4wk course per ID.  Patient will need TEE to confirm.   Patient
   continues to have appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles
   appreciated. Started nafacillin, zosyn d/c'd, cipro started for
   prophylaxis.
   --Nafacillin for staph aureus in blood and peritoneal fluid
   --TEE [**First Name3 (LF) 305**] possibly with EGD
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp

   #Abdominal Pain: Patient appears in a fair amount of pain this morning,
   reports that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus,
   bowel sounds present but decreased, doesn
t have an acute abdomen
   making perforation unlikely.
   --KUB to assess for perforation
   --Morphine as needed for pain control
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated on [**9-22**]; may
   have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large pleural
   effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and

   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Tachycardia: Patient had one episode of tachycardia yesterday.
   Resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses. Patient was significantly
   negative prior to episode of tachycardia, may have been secondary to
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have been pain. Became sinus after fluids and
   lopressor. No signs of acute bleeding, HCT was not decreased.
   --Continue to monitor
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am. CT scans cannot rule out gut
   ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely
   --F/u renal reccommendations
   #Oliguria: UOP decreasing today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Will check bladder pressure to ensure that patient does not need
   therapeutic paracentesis.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis in the setting of no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis, and abdominal pain. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis without organ dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleed (melena, likely from varices or gastropathy), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria/anuria, coagulopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic viral hepatitis, ascites, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. 

Assessment and plan include:
- Nafacillin for Staphylococcus aureus in blood and peritoneal fluid
- Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) possibly with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
- Ciprofloxacin 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
- Re-Cx if spikes temperature
- Will need repeat paracentesis on [**First Name3 (LF) 305**]
- Follow-up with infectious disease recommendations
- Abdominal pain: Morphine as needed for pain control, KUB to assess for perforation
- Hepatic encephalopathy: Lactulose, rifaximin
- GI bleed: Octreotide gtt, Protonix IV"

 EKG - At [**2191-9-24**] 09:55 PM
   - Plan to scope on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] TEE at same time?
   - Transplant surgery: continue supportive care/TF's and signing off
   - ID recs: follow LFT's for Nafcillin, will need 4wks Nafcillin, repeat
   para in 48-72 hrs, repeat Cx's for fevers (?-hard to read)
   - Renal recs: continue supportive care, prognosis poor, no need HD
   today. Dose meds for CrCl <10, replete K.
   - 3pm labs: K better 3.6, Bicarb still 18, Creat improved 4.5, Mg
   slight high 2.7, Phos high 9.2, Hct and Plts improved 25.5 and 31.
   - 11pm Hct: 26.[**3-21**] need repeat Dx para on [**Month (only) 305**]
   - HyperPhos --> sevelamir hydrochloride switched to sevelamir
   carbonate, but that can't be crushed and mixed with H20 for NGT. So,
   contact pharmacy who suggested [**Name (NI) 9183**] x3days, but that is contraindicated
   in GIB. Need to contact renal about what to give --> spoke with renal
   who said Renagel (sevelamir HCl) would probably be ok. If Phos >10 need
   to give Amphigel ([**Name (NI) 9183**]) but not >3days. Need to contact nutrition and
   make sure low phos diet --> Novasource renal is the lowest phos TF's
   there are.
   - Switched back to Sevelamir HCl
   - UOP decreasing through the day
   - 10pm tachy to 150's with atrial tachycardia, given Lopressor 5 IV x2

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and abdominal pain. 

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic with an elevated WBC count but trending down. Staphylococcus aureus coag-positive, sensitive to oxacillin, is growing from blood and peritoneal fluid. The most likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF)**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]. Treating aggressively with a 4-week course per ID. The patient will need a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient appears in fair amount of pain this morning, reporting that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus, bowel sounds present but decreased, and does not have an acute abdomen making perforation unlikely.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient appears less confused this morning. LFTs currently trending down again after being acutely elevated on [**9-22**]. May have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from a large pleural effusion. Total bilirubin continues to trend"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2191-9-24**] 09:55 PM
   - Plan to scope on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] TEE at same time?
   - Transplant surgery: continue supportive care/TF's and signing off
   - ID recs: follow LFT's for Nafcillin, will need 4wks Nafcillin, repeat
   para in 48-72 hrs, repeat Cx's for fevers (?-hard to read)
   - Renal recs: continue supportive care, prognosis poor, no need HD
   today. Dose meds for CrCl <10, replete K.
   - 3pm labs: K better 3.6, Bicarb still 18, Creat improved 4.5, Mg
   slight high 2.7, Phos high 9.2, Hct and Plts improved 25.5 and 31.
   - 11pm Hct: 26.[**3-21**] need repeat Dx para on [**Month (only) 305**]
   - HyperPhos --> sevelamir hydrochloride switched to sevelamir
   carbonate, but that can't be crushed and mixed with H20 for NGT. So,
   contact pharmacy who suggested [**Name (NI) 9183**] x3days, but that is contraindicated
   in GIB. Need to contact renal about what to give --> spoke with renal
   who said Renagel (sevelamir HCl) would probably be ok. If Phos >10 need
   to give Amphigel ([**Name (NI) 9183**]) but not >3days. Need to contact nutrition and
   make sure low phos diet --> Novasource renal is the lowest phos TF's
   there are.
   - Switched back to Sevelamir HCl
   - UOP decreasing through the day
   - 10pm tachy to 150's with atrial tachycardia, given Lopressor 5 IV x2

   setting of no SBP prophylaxis. Abdominal pain today.
   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count elevated but trending down.
   Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from blood and
   peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter seeding
   peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat aggressively with
   4wk course per ID.  Patient will need TEE to confirm.   Patient
   continues to have appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles
   appreciated. Started nafacillin, zosyn d/c'd, cipro started for
   prophylaxis.
   --Nafacillin for staph aureus in blood and peritoneal fluid
   --TEE [**First Name3 (LF) 305**] possibly with EGD
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Re-Cx if spikes temp
   --Will need repeat paracentesis [**First Name3 (LF) 305**]
   #Abdominal Pain: Patient appears in a fair amount of pain this morning,
   reports that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus,
   bowel sounds present but decreased, doesn
t have an acute abdomen
   making perforation unlikely.
   --KUB to assess for perforation
   --Morphine as needed for pain control
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appears less confused this am. LFTs
   currently trending down again after being acutely elevated on [**9-22**]; may
   have been elevated yesterday secondary to irritation from large pleural
   effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.
   #. GI bleed: Likely from varices vs. gastropathy. INR is elevated and
   has been creeping back up. Liver plans for EGD/colonoscopy most likely
   on [**Month/Day (1) 305**].
   --T&S active
   --Has 2 PIV's and now L IJ
   --Octreotide gtt and Protonix IV
   --Hct q8hrs today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Tachycardia: Patient had one episode of tachycardia yesterday.
   Resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses. Patient was significantly
   negative prior to episode of tachycardia, may have been secondary to
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have been pain. Became sinus after fluids and
   lopressor. No signs of acute bleeding, HCT was not decreased.
   --Continue to monitor
   --Restart on beta blocker with holding parameters
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 22 this am. CT scans cannot rule out gut
   ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely
   #Oliguria: UOP improving today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   #.Coagulopathy: INR trending back upwards. Normal fibrinogen rules out
   DIC.
   -Reverse as possible with FFP, vitamin K  as need for procedures
   -nutrition c/s
   #ESLD/Ascites: Per liver team it seems that patient is not a transplant
   candidate at this time because of recent drinking. Patient currently
   hypotensive, so holding Spirololactone and Lasix.
   #DM: Patient receiving TF, on insulin s/s
   -insulin S/S

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and no small bowel prophylaxis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperkalemia, acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hypoalbuminemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic, and the white blood cell count is elevated but trending down. Staphylococcus aureus coag positive, sensitive to oxacillin, is growing from blood and peritoneal fluid, likely originating from the peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum. Aggressive treatment with a 4-week course of antibiotics as recommended by the infectious disease team is necessary. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has likely experienced bleeding from varices or gastropathy. The international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, indicating a coagulopathy. EGD/colonoscopy may be performed to identify the source of bleeding. Octreotide and proton pump inhibitors have been started for bleeding control.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient"

   # Sepsis: Pt remains tachycardic. WBC count significantly elevated
   today to 19.7. Staph aureus coag +  sensitive to oxacillin growing from
   blood and peritoneal fluid. Most likely source is peritoneal catheter
   seeding peritoneum. Evidence of vegetation on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat
   aggressively with 4wk course per ID.  Patient continues to have
   appropriate O2 sats, lung bases dull but no crackles appreciated.
   Started nafacillin, zosyn d/c'd, cipro started for prophylaxis.
   --Nafacillin for staph aureus in blood and peritoneal fluid
   --Cipro 250 mg PO daily for SBP prophylaxis
   --Panculture including repeat paracentesis; most likely source
   continues to be peritoneal fluid given that patient has abdominal pain
   #Abdominal Pain: Patient appears in a fair amount of pain this morning,
   reports that it is his usual liver pain. Continues to have flatus,
   bowel sounds present but decreased, doesn
t have an acute abdomen
   making perforation unlikely.  KUB showed no evidence of free air.
   --Morphine as needed for pain control
   -- Paracentesis
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy: Pt appeared less confused yesterday morning
   prior to morphine, then obtunded after morphine. Tried to use smaller
   morphine doses to prevent obtundation, but patient continued to have
   abdominal pain. LFTs currently trending down again after being acutely
   elevated on [**9-22**]; may have been elevated yesterday secondary to
   irritation from large pleural effusion. T. Bili continues to trend up.
   --NGT given lactulose
   --Rifaxamine as well per liver recommendations.

   --Hct [**Hospital1 **] today, if sign of acute bleeding would check HCT.
   --Will follow platelets [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for <20 or <50 if active
   signs of bleeding
   --If active bleeding will need FFP
   #Tachycardia: Patient had one episode of tachycardia yesterday.
   Resolved with IV lopressor and fluid boluses. Patient was significantly
   negative prior to episode of tachycardia, may have been secondary to
   hypovolemia. [**Month (only) 11**] have been pain. Became sinus after fluids and
   lopressor. No signs of acute bleeding, HCT was not decreased.
   --Continue to monitor
   #Metabolic Acidosis: Gap is 25 this am. CT scans cannot rule out gut
   ischemia, but overall clinical picture is improving. Lactate improving.
   --Surgery has been consulted and felt ischemia unlikely
   --F/u renal recommendations
   #Oliguria: UOP decreasing today. Pre-renal due to hypovolemia vs
   hepatorenal syndrome vs ATN.  Given 1g Albumin.
   --Renal following, felt no need for dialysis at this time given that
   hyperkalemia improved.
   --Renal recs Midodrine for Hepatorenal syndrome
   --Will check bladder pressure to ensure that patient does not need
   therapeutic paracentesis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, no small bowel perforation prophylaxis, and abdominal pain. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleed (likely from varices), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic with an elevated WBC count, indicating ongoing infection. Staphylococcus aureus coag (+) sensitive to oxacillin is growing from blood and peritoneal fluid. The most likely source is the peritoneal catheter seeding the peritoneum. The patient is being aggressively treated with a 4-week course of antibiotics as recommended by the infectious disease team.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has likely experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, possibly from esophageal varices or gastropathy. An elevated INR and Trending up suggests ongoing bleeding. Octreotide and proton pump inhibitors have been initiated to control the bleed.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient appeared less confused yesterday morning before receiving morphine but became obtunded afterward. Lactulose"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He presents with coffee ground emesis/melena, sepsis, and abdominal pain. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding (likely from varices), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, oliguria, coagulopathy, cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis, ascites, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. He is currently in the ICU receiving aggressive treatment for sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The liver team plans to discuss goals of care with the family due to the patient's poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and appropriate antibiotics have been started. Close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent further complications and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes indicate hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin have been initiated to manage this condition. Monitoring the patient's mental status and adjusting treatment as needed is important.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is likely experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from varices. Octreotide and proton pump inhibitors have been started, and close monitoring of vital signs, coagulation profile, and hemodynamic status is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old man with liver failure, peritonitis, acute renal failure, anemia, encephalopathy, probable endocarditis, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the ICU and his prognosis is dire. The main concern is his elevated white blood cell count, which indicates an infection. Diagnostic paracentesis will be performed to further investigate the cause of peritonitis. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, octreotide, and other ICU medications. He is also receiving nutrition and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and heart rate, as well as low oxygen saturation. His lungs show clear breath sounds but with dullness posteriorly, indicating possible fluid accumulation. He has edema in both lower extremities and is unable to stand. Neurological examination reveals normal tone and response to commands. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, high glucose levels, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals a right-sided effusion. The patient's condition requires immediate attention and consultation with specialists.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and symptoms of peritonitis suggest a severe infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Organ failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, and if left untreated, other organs such as the"

   Assessment and Plan
   49-year-old man with
          ESLD
          Acute renal failure
          Peritonitis (MSSA)
          Anemia
          Encephalopathy (hepatic)
          Probable endocarditis
          GI bleed (quiescent at present)
   Main current issue is that WBC has markedly increased.  Will pursue
   diagnostic paracentesis today as per ID.  Continue present ABX for now,
   and appreciate ID
s help.
   Since prolonged ABX required for peritonitis, not pursuing TEE as per
   ID.
   Appreciate hepatology
s help.  They plan to review prognosis and
   situation with family today.  His prognosis is dire.  Anticipate
   discussion with HCP today.

   FAMILY MEETING
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (hepatology attending), along with patient
s nurse, led family
   meeting with HCP.  [**Name (NI) **] prognosis and limited therapeutic options
   discussed, and all questions answered.  She wishes to focus on comfort
   and pain-control, rather than attempts at prolongation.  This seems
   very reasonable.  We will therefore move to comfort measures only.

","The patient is a 49-year-old man with multiple medical conditions, including liver failure (ESLD), acute renal failure, peritonitis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), anemia, hepatic encephalopathy, probable endocarditis, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count has significantly increased, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has peritonitis caused by MSSA and a high WBC count, suggesting a potential infection. Diagnostic paracentesis is planned to identify the cause of the infection.

2. Endocarditis: The patient has signs and symptoms consistent with endocarditis, such as fever, positive blood cultures, and heart murmur. This condition can lead to further complications if left untreated.

3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can worsen if not managed appropriately. This may require dialysis or other renal replacement therapies.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function due to severe liver disease. It can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.

5. GI bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can recur and lead to significant blood loss and anemia.

6. Septic shock:"
