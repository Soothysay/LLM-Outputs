   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted after he presented for
   scheduled chemotherapy with fevers to 101 in clinic and transferred to
   the ICU for persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy.
   .
   # Sepsis: Given WBC of 3.3, hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
   Possible source includes pulmonary source of infection, and recent
   bronchoscopy. Though no evidence of aspiration pneumonia after bronch.
   Patient had a fever last night, and was cultured. Adrenal insufficiency
   may be a contributing factor, given history of intermittent chronic
   steroid use.  Patient
s tachypnea and tachycardia seemed to respond
   well to high dose steroids. Patient had some element of hypotension
   prior to bronchoscopy.
   - Fluid bolus as necessary for hypotension and tachycardia. Goal
   MAP>60.
   -Continue stress dose steroids
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotic and antifungal therapy with
   vancomycin, cefepime and voriconazole.
   - Monitor mental status and urine output > 30cc/hr.
   # Pneumonia. Patient had multifocal pneumonia prior to bronch.  No
   evidence of aspiration pneumonia on chest x-ray s/p bronch, but this is
   a possibility. BAL and bronchial washings gram stains show 1+ GPC in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who presented for scheduled chemotherapy but was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy. The patient has been experiencing fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 59-131 mmHg, heart rate of 95-144 bpm, respiratory rate of 26-49 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's ABG results show respiratory alkalosis. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's low white blood cell count, hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea suggest the possibility of sepsis. The patient may be at risk for further deterioration in organ function and potentially develop septic shock.
2. Pneumonia: The patient had multifocal pneumonia prior to bronchoscopy, and there is a possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is at risk for worsening respiratory symptoms and potential respiratory failure.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's progressive confusion could be due to infection, hypotension, or the administration of steroids. Close monitoring is necessary to assess any changes in mental status and prevent further complications.

- The patient presented with fevers in the clinic and was transferred to the ICU for persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy.
- The patient is experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress, which are likely secondary to pneumonia. The patient has developed pneumonitis as a result of the bronchoscopy.
- The patient's mental status has progressively worsened, possibly due to infection, hypotension, or steroids.
- The patient has a history of prior bleomycin lung toxicity, hypothyroidism, asthma, HBV core antibody positivity, and is currently on various medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, stress dose steroids, and prophylactic treatments.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of hypotension, tachycardia, and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening mental status could be due to pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who presented with fevers and was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypotension after a bronchoscopy. The patient's current medical conditions include sepsis physiology, respiratory distress, tachycardia, altered mental status, hypothyroidism, asthma, HBV core antibody positive, and potential bleomycin lung toxicity.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, hypotension, and altered mental status suggest a possible septic state. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia are likely due to pneumonia. If not appropriately managed, this can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to further respiratory compromise.

3. Bleomycin lung toxicity: The patient has a history of prior bleomycin lung toxicity. Continued exposure to high levels of oxygen may worsen this condition and result in pulmonary fibrosis or other lung damage.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of intermittent chronic steroid use and response to stress dose steroids suggests an underlying adrenal insufficiency. Insufficient cortisol levels can lead to hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and shock if not appropriately managed.

5. Hypothyroidism: Although the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who presented for scheduled chemotherapy and was admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy. The patient has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. The most likely cause of these symptoms is sepsis physiology, with multifocal pneumonia being a possible source of infection. The patient also has a history of intermittent chronic steroid use, which may contribute to adrenal insufficiency. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, hypotension, and altered mental status suggest the possibility of sepsis. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal therapy with vancomycin, cefepime, and voriconazole. Follow-up on blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture data is also recommended.
2. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs on gram stains from BAL and bronchial washings indicate the possibility of pneumonia. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is crucial.
3. Bleomycin toxicity: The patient has a history of bleomycin lung toxicity, which can be exacerbated by high levels of oxygen supplementation. It is important to limit oxygen supplementation to less than FiO2 33% to prevent further lung toxicity.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who has undergone an allogeneic transplant with recurrence. He presented for scheduled chemotherapy with fevers and was admitted to the ICU for persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4 F, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 105/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high flow nasal cannula. 

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 3.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, elevated AST and ALT levels, normal creatinine level, and electrolyte imbalances. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: Possible etiologies include sepsis due to a pulmonary source of infection and recent bronchoscopy, as well as adrenal insufficiency. The patient responded well to stress dose steroids. 
   - Fluid bolus as necessary for hypotension and tachycardia. Goal MAP >60.
   - Monitor mental status and urine output.
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal therapy with vancomycin, cefepime, and voriconazole.

2. Respiratory distress: RR 40-50s."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant and has recurrence of the disease. He was admitted four days ago with fevers and multifocal pneumonia. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday and remained in the ICU due to hypotension. The patient has been intermittently hypotensive but responsive to fluid resuscitation. He has also been tachycardic and tachypneic, with respiratory alkalosis on blood gas analysis. Stress dose steroids were started with some improvement, but the patient became more confused as the night progressed. The patient's allergies include bleomycin, unknown to the healthcare provider, and nausea/vomiting to Bactrim (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim). The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, lorazepam, heparin sodium, levothyroxine, serevent, MVI, pantoprazole, lamivudine, hep SQ tid, atrovent nebs, hydrocortisone, alb nebs, ativan 0.5-1 mg q6h prn, oxycodone, zyprexa, tylenol, Mg sulfate, and others. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 38.6°C (101.4°F) to 35.4°C (95.7°F), heart rate ranging from 102 bpm to 144 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/57 mmHg to 76/35 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 30 breaths/min to 49 breaths/min, SpO2 at 95%, and sinus tachycardia on EKG. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.0 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 104 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 21 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and other abnormal values. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient's assessment includes hypotension/shock, respiratory distress, multifocal pneumonia, adrenal insufficiency, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient is currently receiving aggressive care in the ICU with multiple interventions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Severe infection: The patient has been admitted with fevers and multifocal pneumonia, indicating a possible severe infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and tachypnea may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
3. Hypotension and shock: The patient's hypotension and shock state require close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's chronic steroid therapy may have caused adrenal insufficiency, which needs to be managed appropriately with stress dose steroids.
5. Complications related to indwelling lines and tubes: The patient has an indwelling port and multiple IV lines, which can increase the risk of infection.
6. Pneumonia progression: The patient's multifocal pneumonia may worsen, leading to additional respiratory complications.
7. Delirium or altered mental status: The patient's confusion and worsening mental status require prompt evaluation and management.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, who underwent an allo-BMT and now has recurrence. He was admitted to the ICU with fevers and multifocal pneumonia. He underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday and remained in the ICU due to hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4 F, blood pressure ranging from 76/35 to 131/81 mmHg, heart rate of 102 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. His ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 331, and HCO3- of 21 mEq/L. 

The patient has been intermittently hypotensive but responsive to fluid, and tachycardic, tachypneic (respiratory alkalosis). He started on stress dose steroids with some improvement but became more confused as the night progressed. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress.

The patient's physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, normocephalic head, no endotracheal or NG tube, and symmetric chest expansion with crackles in the left lung. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. He has warm skin without"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and an allogeneic bone marrow transplant.
- He was admitted with multi-focal pneumonia (PNA), recent hypotension, and tachycardia.
- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday and has an indwelling PortaCath.
- He has been experiencing respiratory distress, which is being managed with minimal supplemental oxygen.
- The patient is receiving fluid resuscitation due to hypotension and shock.
- He is on various antibiotics for multi-focal PNA, and his bronch cultures are pending.
- The patient is also being treated for adrenal insufficiency from chronic steroid therapy.
- His condition is being closely monitored, and he is receiving appropriate care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multi-focal pneumonia, and there is a risk of further infections due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of an indwelling PortaCath.
2. Hypotension and shock: The patient's hypotension and shock may persist or worsen if not adequately managed with fluid resuscitation and other interventions.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress could potentially deteriorate if not properly managed, especially considering his underlying lung condition.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency needs to be carefully managed with stress-dose steroids to"

The patient is a 45-year-old male presenting with dyspnea. He is in the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory distress but has shown improvement. The patient has a history of allergies to Bleomycin, Bactrim, and an unknown allergy. He was started on various antibiotics (Cefipime, Vancomycin, Acyclovir, and Voriconazole) and other medications including Heparin for prophylaxis, Lorazepam, and Pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 89/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.21. Physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings, but peripheral pulses were not assessed. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Neurologic examination was not performed. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated blood glucose and creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

   Assessment and Plan
   1)  Respiratory Distress/pneumonia: Improved;  room air saturation in
   90s
          - Aggressive albuterol/atrovent
          - Continue antibiotics for pneumonia
   2) Hypotension: Improved with fluids, antibiotics, and stress-dose
   steroids
   3) Bone marrow transplant
   Disposition: Given improved respiratory status and hypotension (which
   was likely secondary to HAP), will discharge to the floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension post-bronch and treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). He has been experiencing dyspnea but no objective worsening. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 89/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is awake, alert, and in no acute distress. His cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and his peripheral pulses are not assessed. The respiratory/chest examination reveals symmetric expansion, and his abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. His skin is warm and dry, and his neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 3.3 to 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin levels ranging from 8.8 to 24.9 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 104 to 147 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 106 to 182 mg/dL, and creatinine levels remaining at 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate normal ranges for electrolytes and liver enzymes.
