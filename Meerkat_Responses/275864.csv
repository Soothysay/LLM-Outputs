   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, a
   to ICU w/ PEA arrest [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   .
   # Shock/PEA Arrest: Witness arrest [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   - Now hemodynamically stable, access achieved.
   - Culture broadly to guid further care but would not cover with
   antibiotics at this time
   - Rule out for MI with serial enzymes
   - follow-UOP and bolus IVF's PRN.
   - Opt for dopamine or levo as initial pressor of choice.
   - frequent suctioning and bronch to evaluate airways for retained food.
   .
   # Neuro: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event, and now
   with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission to ICU.
   Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure.
   - Will need sedation and paralysis for cooling.
   - Low dose fentanyl/versed for sedation for now.
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - Dysconjugate gaze c/w possible seizure consult neuro for EEG.
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - Repeat ABG now and titrate oxygen/PEEP, minute vent to effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - Blood cultures, urine cultures for infectious source given white
   blood cell count, but do not suspect sepsis at this time.
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - Appreciate liver rec's
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS.
   - Send urine lytes, repeat Ua post-arrest
   - Appreciate renal rec's.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Negative tap for SBP on [**2145-1-5**].
   Urine growing E. Coli.  Pan-culture.
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require OP ENT followup.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line, arterial line.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU due to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest caused by a mucous plug in the airway. The patient has been hemodynamically stable since then, with access achieved for further care. 

The assessment and plan include several potential complications and concerns:

1. Shock/PEA Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest due to a mucous plug. Now, he is hemodynamically stable with access achieved. Cultures will be broad to guide further care, and antibiotics will not be initiated at this time. The plan also includes ruling out myocardial infarction (MI) with serial enzymes.

2. Neurological Issues: The patient has a slowly resolving delirium and may have had a hypoxic insult to the brain. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission to the ICU was 6-27. A cooling protocol has been initiated, and a head CT will be done to evaluate for anoxic brain injury post-cooling. There is also a concern for possible seizures, so a neuro evaluation and EEG have been requested.

3. Respiratory/Ventilation: The patient is on assist control ventilation with low tidal volumes to avoid unnecessary injury. The goal pH is above 7.25. Repeat ABG will be done to titrate oxygen/PEEP and minute ventilation to effect"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, a
   to ICU w/ PEA arrest [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   .
   # Shock/PEA Arrest: Witness arrest [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   - initially hemodynamically stable
   - overnight with repositioning had hypotension non-responsive to IVF
   boluses, levofed started.  Etiology of hypotension is cardiogenic shock
   s/p PEA vs. septic shock secondary to pneumonia
   - check central venous O2 today; if high, likely in septic shock, would
   continue levofed; if low, could consider adding extra inotropic pressor
   like dopamine
   - echo today if possible over arctic sun suit
   - continue goal MAP >65
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - required increased FiO2 and PEEP overnight due to low oxygenation
   - likely has early ARDS, based on P:F ratio, CXR; continue ARDS net
   protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, increasing leukocytosis today
   - on vanco/zosyn for HAP; add double coverage of GN with cipro after
   checking EKG for QT prolongation this morning
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Neuro: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event, and now
   with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission to ICU.
   Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure.
   - Continue cooling protocol, will rewarm around noon today
   - Low dose fentanyl/versed for sedation for now; failed trial of
   propofol overnight.
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - EEG prelim report neg for seizure, f/u final read
   - head CT after warmed
   .
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion, still has some urine output
   - avoid fluid boluses if possible per renal recs
   - Send urine lytes, repeat Ua post-arrest
   - Appreciate renal rec's.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - continue to trend lactate
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   - CK and Trop trending downward,
   - echo today if possible to evaluate for function post PEA
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - Appreciate liver rec's
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Negative tap for SBP on [**2145-1-5**].
   Urine growing E. Coli.  Pan-culture.
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require OP ENT followup.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line, arterial line.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Code: full

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to a mucous plug. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). There are concerns for cardiogenic shock versus septic shock secondary to pneumonia. The patient's renal function is also compromised, and there is uncertainty regarding the etiology of the renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: Given the presence of HAP and compromised immune system due to cirrhosis, the patient is at risk of developing sepsis.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's low oxygenation and need for increased FiO2 and PEEP suggest early ARDS. If not managed properly, it can progress and lead to severe respiratory failure.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The hypotension non-responsive to IV fluid boluses and the initiation of levophed suggest cardiogenic shock. This condition can worsen if not appropriately managed.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels indicate compromised renal function. Renal failure can further complicate the patient's condition if not addressed promptly.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, a
   to ICU w/ PEA arrest [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   .
   # Shock/PEA Arrest: Witness arrest [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   - Now hemodynamically stable, access achieved.
   - Culture broadly to guid further care but would not cover with
   antibiotics at this time
   - Rule out for MI with serial enzymes
   - follow-UOP and bolus IVF's PRN.
   - Opt for dopamine or levo as initial pressor of choice.
   - frequent suctioning and bronch to evaluate airways for retained food.
   .
   # Neuro: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event, and now
   with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission to ICU.
   Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure.
   - Will need sedation and paralysis for cooling.
   - Low dose fentanyl/versed for sedation for now.
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - Dysconjugate gaze c/w possible seizure consult neuro for EEG.
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - Repeat ABG now and titrate oxygen/PEEP, minute vent to effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - Blood cultures, urine cultures for infectious source given white
   blood cell count, but do not suspect sepsis at this time.
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - Appreciate liver rec's

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to a mucous plug. He is currently hemodynamically stable with access achieved. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including shock/PEA arrest, neurologic issues, respiratory/ventilation problems, metabolic acidosis, cardiac concerns, renal failure, leukocytosis, and a parotid mass. He is receiving various treatments and interventions such as antibiotics, sedation, paralysis, and respiratory support. The patient's family is informed and involved in the care decisions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his immunocompromised state, presence of central lines, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient has evidence of organ dysfunction in multiple systems including the liver (cirrhosis), kidneys (renal failure), and possibly the heart (cardiac concerns).
3. Neurological impairment: The patient's neurological status is a concern due to the PEA arrest and potential hypoxic insult to the brain. Monitoring for seizures and further evaluation of brain function is necessary.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient requires mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Frequent suctioning and bronchoscopic evaluation are recommended.
5. Hemodynamic instability: Despite currently being"

   # Shock/PEA Arrest: Witness arrest [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   - initially hemodynamically stable
   - overnight with repositioning had hypotension non-responsive to IVF
   boluses, levofed started.  Etiology of hypotension is cardiogenic shock
   s/p PEA vs. septic shock secondary to pneumonia
   - check central venous O2 today; if high, likely in septic shock, would
   continue levofed; if low, could consider adding extra inotropic pressor
   like dopamine
   - echo today if possible over arctic sun suit
   - continue goal MAP >65
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - required increased FiO2 and PEEP overnight due to low oxygenation
   - likely has early ARDS, based on P:F ratio, CXR; continue ARDS net
   protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, increasing leukocytosis today
   - on vanco/zosyn for HAP; add double coverage of GN with cipro after
   checking EKG for QT prolongation this morning
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Neuro: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event, and now
   with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission to ICU.
   Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure.
   - Continue cooling protocol, will rewarm around noon today
   - Low dose fentanyl/versed for sedation for now; failed trial of
   propofol overnight.
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - EEG prelim report neg for seizure, f/u final read
   - head CT after warmed
   .
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion, still has some urine output
   - avoid fluid boluses if possible per renal recs
   - Send urine lytes, repeat Ua post-arrest
   - Appreciate renal rec's.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - continue to trend lactate, are normalizing
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   - CK and Trop trending downward,
   - echo today if possible to evaluate for function post PEA

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to a mucous plug. The patient initially presented with hemodynamic stability but experienced hypotension overnight that was unresponsive to intravenous fluid boluses, leading to the initiation of levophed. The etiology of hypotension is suspected to be cardiogenic shock secondary to pneumonia or septic shock. 

The patient is currently on assist control ventilation with low tidal volumes to prevent further lung injury. The goal is to maintain a pH above 7.25 and adjust FiO2 and PEEP accordingly. There is a concern for early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on the P:F ratio and chest X-ray findings, so the ARDSnet protocol will be continued with low Vt and high PEEPs.

The patient has pneumonia with right lower lobe infiltrate and bronchial secretions, for which vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were started. Coverage for gram-negative infections like E. coli has been added due to leukocytosis and positive urine culture.

Neurological evaluation shows a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 6 on admission, with slowly resolving delirium. A cooling protocol has been initiated, and head CT will be performed after rewarming to evaluate for anoxic brain injury. The patient is also at risk for seizures"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man who experienced respiratory and cardiac arrest following a complicated hospital course. The patient is currently receiving therapeutic hypothermia and is in the ICU.

The patient's condition is critical, with several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Hypotension requiring vasopressors: The patient has been experiencing hypotension that necessitates the use of norepinephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio (<200) and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, which may suggest ARDS. This is further supported by the need for increased respiratory support, including positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and increased FiO2.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's laboratory values show an increase in serum creatinine levels, indicating potential renal impairment. This could be due to factors such as hypoperfusion, sepsis, or direct kidney injury.

4. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including elevated white blood cell count and positive cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This suggests a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

5. Neurologic impairment: The patient is sedated and unresponsive, making it difficult to assess his neurologic status. There is a concern for potential brain"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but overnight had hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses, levofed
   started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
   s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - required increased FiO2 and PEEP overnight due to low oxygenation
   - likely has early ARDS, based on P:F ratio, CXR; continue ARDS net
   protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, increasing leukocytosis today
   - on vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic
   brain injury post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg
   for seizure
   - off sedation
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - will need head CT
   . .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS. given 2 days of albumin per hepatology recs.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion, still has some urine output. Will
   consider mitodrine and octreotride.
   - f/u renal rec's.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - continue to trend lactate, are normalizing
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic shock.
   - CK and Trop trending downward,
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delerium
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Negative tap for SBP on [**2145-1-5**].
   Urine growing E. Coli.  Pan-culture.
   - likely from pneumonia
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require OP ENT followup.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line, arterial line.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, who experienced a cardiac arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with a previous delirium and now potential hypoxic insult to the brain. The patient's renal function is compromised, possibly due to hypoperfusion or hepatorenal syndrome. There is also evidence of metabolic acidosis, cardiac abnormalities, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has shown signs of pneumonia, indicated by a right lower lobe infiltrate and bronchial secretions on chest X-ray. This is further supported by an increase in leukocytosis. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and the etiology is unclear. The patient has been given albumin as per hepatology recommendations for hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's urine output is still present, and further management will involve considering medications like midodrine and octreotide.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient experienced metabolic acidosis following the cardiac arrest, which was likely due to tissue hypoxia. The acidosis has"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, a to ICU w/ PEA arrest
   [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   .
   # Shock/PEA Arrest: Witness arrest [**12-21**] to mucous plug.
   - initially hemodynamically stable
   - overnight with repositioning had hypotension non-responsive to IVF
   boluses, levofed started.  Etiology of hypotension is cardiogenic shock
   s/p PEA vs. septic shock secondary to pneumonia
   - check central venous O2 today; if high, likely in septic shock, would
   continue levofed; if low, could consider adding extra inotropic pressor
   like dopamine
   - echo today if possible over arctic sun suit
   - continue goal MAP >65
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - required increased FiO2 and PEEP overnight due to low oxygenation
   - likely has early ARDS, based on P:F ratio, CXR; continue ARDS net
   protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, increasing leukocytosis today
   - on vanco/zosyn for HAP; add double coverage of GN with cipro after
   checking EKG for QT prolongation this morning
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Neuro: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event, and now
   with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission to ICU.
   Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure.
   - Continue cooling protocol, will rewarm around noon today
   - Low dose fentanyl/versed for sedation for now; failed trial of
   propofol overnight.
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - EEG prelim report neg for seizure, f/u final read
   - head CT after warmed
   .
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion, still has some urine output
   - avoid fluid boluses if possible per renal recs
   - Send urine lytes, repeat Ua post-arrest
   - Appreciate renal rec's.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - continue to trend lactate, are normalizing
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He was successfully resuscitated but remains hemodynamically unstable overnight, requiring multiple IV fluid boluses and initiation of levofloxacin. The etiology of hypotension is cardiogenic shock secondary to PEA versus septic shock due to pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes severe encephalopathy, hypoxemia requiring high FiO2 and PEEP, and signs of respiratory distress with an ARDS net protocol initiated. There are also concerns about renal failure, metabolic acidosis, cardiac elevation in cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis with negative tap for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and an incidental finding of a left parotid mass. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, electrolyte repletion, and tube feeds after rewarming. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and poor perfusion may lead to further complications related to inadequate cardiac function.
2. Septic shock: The presence of pneumonia and leukocytosis raises concern for sepsis and potential progression to septic shock.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygenation and need for increased FiO2 and PEEP suggest early ARDS, which can worsen lung function and lead to respiratory failure.
4. Hepatic hydrothorax: Given the patient's cirrhosis and abdominal fluid accumulation, there is a risk of hepatic hydrothorax, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's severe encephalopathy may deteriorate further, leading to increased confusion, altered mental status, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's unclear renal etiology and ongoing renal dysfunction increase the risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Sepsis: The combination of pneumonia, leukocytosis, and positive urine culture for E. coli suggests an ongoing infectious process, increasing the risk of sepsis and its associated complications.
8. Pneumonia progression: The patient's current respiratory status and infiltrate on chest X-ray indicate pneumonia, which may worsen and lead to respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.
9. Parotid mass: The incidental finding of a left parotid mass requires further evaluation and management, which may impact the patient's overall prognosis and treatment plan.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of thromboembolic events, including DVT and PE. Prophylaxis measures should be continued or intensified as appropriate."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac arrest, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been sedated with midazolam. The EEG shows extremely severe encephalopathy, indicating a poor prognosis if not caused by sedating agents. The patient has received albumin for hepatorenal syndrome and started total parenteral nutrition (TFs). Vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 147/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 36.4°C. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation of 94%, and fluid balance within normal limits. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.49. Laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 26.5 K/uL, increased creatinine levels (Cr) ranging from 1.9 to 2.5 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 2.0 mmol/L. Other lab values show abnormalities in liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and was subsequently admitted to the ICU. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation. He has been receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has renal failure, hypotension, and a history of confusion/delirium. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 147/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results indicate acute renal failure with elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Other lab abnormalities include elevated white blood cell count, prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated troponin T levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated inflammatory markers suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ARDS.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal failure, elevated serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels indicate the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest two days ago and was hospitalized for cervical cord compression, which was decompressed. The patient also had post-operative encephalopathy that is improving, as well as worsening renal insufficiency.

The patient's history includes allergies to Demerol and confusion/delirium. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 01/07/2145 at 04:00 PM, 08:07 PM, and 10:00 AM respectively.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications being administered include albumin for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and lactulose for altered mental status.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for opening eyes. The flow sheet data shows stable vital signs with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/55 mmHg to 147/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but overnight had hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses, levofed
   started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
   s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - required increased FiO2 and PEEP overnight due to low oxygenation
   - likely has early ARDS, based on P:F ratio, CXR; continue ARDS net
   protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, increasing leukocytosis today
   - on vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic
   brain injury post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg
   for seizure
   - off sedation
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - will need head CT
   . .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS. given 2 days of albumin per hepatology recs.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion, still has some urine output. Will
   consider mitodrine and octreotride.
   - f/u renal rec's.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - continue to trend lactate, are normalizing
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic shock.
   - CK and Trop trending downward,
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delerium
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Negative tap for SBP on [**2145-1-5**].
   Urine growing E. Coli.  Pan-culture.
   - likely from pneumonia
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require OP ENT followup.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line, arterial line.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds resuming [**1-9**]
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, famotidine
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest and subsequent cooling and rewarming. The patient was initially hemodynamically stable but developed hypotension unresponsive to IV fluids, leading to the initiation of levophed. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock. The patient has been weaned off sedation and is responding to name. There is a concern for pneumonia with right lower lobe infiltrate and increasing leukocytosis. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Mental status is described as slowly resolving delirium prior to the event, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 6-27 on admission to the ICU. There is a possibility of hypoxic brain injury and a head CT is planned. The patient has renal failure of unclear etiology, with some urine output despite hypoperfusion. Albumin is being given as per hepatology recommendations. Metabolic acidosis has resolved, likely due to post-code hypoperfusion. Cardiac enzymes are trending downward. The patient has leukocytosis, possibly secondary to pneumonia, and a parotid mass, which will require ENT follow-up. The patient has multiple access lines in place and is currently receiving IV fluids and tube feeds. Prophylactic medications are being held due to elevated PTT. The patient's code"

   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but overnight had hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses, levofed
   started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
   s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - required increased FiO2 and PEEP overnight due to low oxygenation
   - likely has early ARDS, based on P:F ratio, CXR; continue ARDS net
   protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, increasing leukocytosis today
   - on vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic
   brain injury post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg
   for seizure
   - off sedation
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - will need head CT
   . .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS. given 2 days of albumin per hepatology recs.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion, still has some urine output. Will
   consider mitodrine and octreotride.
   - f/u renal rec's.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - continue to trend lactate, are normalizing
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic shock.
   - CK and Trop trending downward,
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delerium
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Negative tap for SBP on [**2145-1-5**].
   Urine growing E. Coli.  Pan-culture.
   - likely from pneumonia
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require OP ENT followup.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line, arterial line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome, who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming. He is currently being treated for pneumonia and has been mechanically ventilated. The patient has renal failure of unclear etiology, metabolic acidosis, cardiac issues related to the arrest, and a leukocytosis with an unclear cause. There is also an incidental finding of a left parotid mass. The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including a central line, arterial line, and PIV catheter. He is receiving IV fluids, tube feeds, and various medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to mechanical ventilation and possible early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection due to pneumonia coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
3. Renal failure with an unclear etiology, possibly related to hepatorenal syndrome or hypoperfusion.
4. Metabolic acidosis that resolved but may recur.
5. Cardiac complications from the PEA arrest, including potential elevation in cardiac enzymes.
6. Cirrhosis and concern for hepatorenal syndrome.
7. Leukocytosis with an unclear etiology, likely secondary to infection.
8. Parotid mass requiring further evaluation.
9. Complications related to long-term mechanical ventilation, such as ventil"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but overnight had hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses, levofed
   started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
   s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - required increased FiO2 and PEEP overnight due to low oxygenation
   - likely has early ARDS, based on P:F ratio, CXR; continue ARDS net
   protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, increasing leukocytosis today
   - on vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Consider cooling protocol.  Head CT to evaluate for anoxic
   brain injury post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg
   for seizure
   - off sedation
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - will need head CT
   . .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS. given 2 days of albumin per hepatology recs.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion, still has some urine output. Will
   consider mitodrine and octreotride.
   - f/u renal rec's.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - continue to trend lactate, are normalizing
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic shock.
   - CK and Trop trending downward,
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delerium
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Negative tap for SBP on [**2145-1-5**].
   Urine growing E. Coli.  Pan-culture.
   - likely from pneumonia
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require OP ENT followup.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line, arterial line.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds resuming [**1-9**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient also has renal failure of unclear etiology, metabolic acidosis, cardiac abnormalities post-arrest, cirrhosis with concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), leukocytosis, and an incidental finding of a left parotid mass. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with assist control mode and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). His mental status is slowly resolving after delirium, and there is a concern for possible anoxic brain injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest pneumonia, which is being covered with antibiotics.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the low oxygenation and P:F ratio, there is a concern for early ARDS. The patient will continue with low tidal volumes and high PEEPs as per ARDS net protocol.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has cirrhosis and renal failure, raising the suspicion for HRS. Albumin infusions are being given per hepatology recommendations, and further evaluation and treatment will be considered.

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. He experienced a post-cardiac arrest syndrome after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming. The patient's condition has been unstable, with hypotension that was non-responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF) boluses. He was started on levophed but is currently off it. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock. The patient's respiratory status has required increased FiO2 and PEEP due to low oxygenation, and he likely has early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently on assist control ventilation with low tidal volumes to avoid unnecessary injury.

The patient also has pneumonia, as indicated by a right lower lobe infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow secretions. He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia. His mental status is slowly resolving, but he still exhibits severe encephalopathy.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/Pressure Support Ventilation) mode. Pressors have been weaned, indicating improvement in hemodynamic stability. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/41 mmHg to 158/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total input of 3,236 mL and output of 1,680 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,556 mL. The patient is receiving multiple IV fluids, medications, and nutrition through a multi-lumen line.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but there is a slight increase in blood urea nitrogen and glucose levels. Imaging shows stable bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's conditions and potential complications include altered mental status, renal failure, hypotension, cardiac arrest, acute respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia, cirrhosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   - stable now after off pressors
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.
   - required increased FiO2 and PEEP overnight due to low oxygenation,
   will try to wean as tolerated
   - likely has early ARDS, based on P:F ratio, CXR; continue ARDS net
   protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs
   - seems to have improved, cont tx with abx
   - extubated yesterday
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, leukocytosis starting to resolve
   - on vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation
   - off sedation, waking up, mouthing words
   - LP done earlier this admit that was negative gram stain/culture, no
   whites, negative HSV PCR.
   - would not cooperate with CT at this time, will hold off for now
   . .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS. given 2 days of albumin per hepatology recs.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion v. HRS, starting to improve,
   making good urine output
   - f/u renal rec's.
   - giving mitodrine and octreotide and albumin
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - lactates normalized
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic shock.
   - CK and Trop trending downward,
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - will follow s/p extubation, continue lactulose, unclear etiology at
   this time
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Negative tap for SBP on [**2145-1-5**].
   Urine growing E. Coli.  Pan-culture.
   - likely from pneumonia
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require OP ENT followup.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line, d/c
ed art line today
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds resuming [**1-9**]
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, famotidine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming. The patient has been in the ICU and has had several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient required intense suctioning of bloody secretions and had acute respiratory distress around 4 am. He also required increased FiO2 and PEEP due to low oxygenation. There is a concern for early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the ARDS net protocol with low Vt and high PEEPs is being followed.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow secretions on chest X-ray. He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP).

3. Mental status changes: The patient had a slowly resolving delirium prior to the event and now has unclear hypoxic insult to the brain. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission to the ICU was 6-27, indicating severe encephalopathy. A head CT is being considered to evaluate for anoxic brain injury post-cooling.

4. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure with unclear etiology. He is being treated with albumin per hepatology recommendations"

   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   - stable now after off pressors
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Assist control.  Low tidal volumes to avoid
   unneeded injury, with pH goal of above 7.25.  Acute desats overnight
   [**12-21**] agitation -> improved with sedation and nebs.  Will likely continue
   to aspirate [**12-21**] mental status, may need to re-intubate depending on
   respiratory status.
   - extubated yesterday
   - cont 5-day total course of ABX
   - cont local care
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, leukocytosis starting to resolve
   - on vanco/zosyn for total 5-day course
   - follow up cultures, NGTD
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  Back to pre-code
   MS per wife.
   - off sedation, waking up, mouthing words
   - LP done earlier that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites,
   negative HSV PCR
   - would not cooperate with CT at this time, will hold off for now
   - cont lactulose
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear Etiology.  Renal following given concern for
   HRS. given 2 days of albumin per hepatology recs.
   - likely in setting of hypoperfusion v. HRS, starting to improve,
   making good urine output
   - f/u renal rec's.
   - giving mitodrine and octreotide and albumin
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - correct slowly today with IVF, 150cc/hr
   - check lytes Q6H
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - lactates normalized

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming.
- The patient has been hemodynamically stable but has had episodes of hypotension that were non-responsive to intravenous fluid boluses.
- An echocardiogram showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
- The patient was extubated yesterday but required reintubation due to acute respiratory distress and desaturation to the 80s.
- The patient is on a total 5-day course of antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, which is also indicated by leukocytosis and a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with a slowly resolving delirium prior to the recent event and now with unclear hypoxic insult to the brain. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 6 on admission to the ICU.
- There is a concern for anoxic brain injury, and a head CT is being considered. An electroencephalogram (EEG) has been done and is negative for seizure activity.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, with unclear etiology. The patient is receiving albumin as per hepatology recommendations.
- The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to hypovolemic causes such as recent acute tub"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   - stable now after off pressors
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change.
   - pt will likely need trach if long-term care is the goal
   - cont 5-day total course of vanc/zosyn
   - cont local care
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, leukocytosis starting to resolve
   - on vanco/zosyn for total 5-day course
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  Back to pre-code
   MS per wife.
   - off sedation, still not following commands or making purposeful
   movements
   - LP done earlier that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites,
   negative HSV PCR
   - CT scan did not show any focal lesions
   - likely will need MRI in the future but can not tolerate now [**12-21**]
   mental status/respiratory status
   - increase lactulose to TID, continue rifaximin
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN in the
   setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS. On
   albumin, mitodrine and octreotide per liver/renal.
   - urine output improving
   - giving mitodrine, octreotide and albumin
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], rree water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock.
   - CK and Trop trended down
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   ..
   # Gram negative bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin.
   - will continue surveillance blood cxs
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, famotidine
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals today
   re: long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming. He was initially hemodynamically stable but had episodes of hypotension that were non-responsive to intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock. The patient has been re-intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's mental status is described as slowly resolving delirium with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6-27 on admission to the ICU. There is concern for anoxic brain injury post-cooling, and an MRI is recommended in the future. The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of cardiogenic shock and hepatorenal syndrome. He is receiving albumin, midodrine, and octreotide for renal support. The patient also has hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, and a history of cirrhosis with concern for hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS). He is being treated for pneumonia and gram-negative bacter"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   - stable now after off pressors
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.
   - pt will likely need trach
   - cont 5-day total course of ABX
   - cont local care
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, leukocytosis starting to resolve
   - on vanco/zosyn for total 5-day course
   - follow up cultures, NGTD
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  Back to pre-code
   MS per wife.
   - off sedation, still not following commands or making purposeful
   movements
   - LP done earlier that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites,
   negative HSV PCR
   - CT scan did not show any focal lesions
   - likely will need MRI in the future but can not tolerate now [**12-21**]
   mental status/respiratory status
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN in the
   setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS. On
   albumin, mitodrine and octreotide per liver.
   - urine output improving
   - giving mitodrine, octreotide and albumin
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], rree water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - continue to check lytes
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Continue IVF's
   and trend lactate.  Will need to increase minute ventilation for CO2.
   - resolved, likely in setting of post code hypoperfusion
   - lactates normalized
   .
   # Cardiac: Anticipate some elevation in CE's post-arrest, will trend.
   Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic shock.
   - CK and Trop trended down
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - continue lactulose
   - will f/u with liver re: long-term management/prognosis
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology.  Negative tap for SBP on [**2145-1-5**].
   Urine growing E. Coli.  Pan-culture.
   - likely from pneumonia
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, famotidine

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, body cooling, and rewarming. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient was re-intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. There is a concern for pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and leukocytosis starting to resolve. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for a total 5-day course of antibiotics.

2. Mental Status/Seizure: The patient has a history of delirium, and now there is a concern for hypoxic insult to the brain. His mental status is still not clear, and he is not following commands or making purposeful movements. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was negative for seizure, and a lumbar puncture was also negative. A head CT scan did not show any focal lesions, but an MRI may be needed in the future.

3. Renal Failure: The etiology of renal failure is unclear, but it is likely a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of the code and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient is receiving albumin"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   - stable now after off pressors
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change.
   - pt will likely need trach if long-term care is the goal
   - cont 5-day total course of vanc/zosyn
   - cont local care
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, leukocytosis starting to resolve
   - on vanco/zosyn for total 5-day course
   - follow up cultures, NGTD
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  Back to pre-code
   MS per wife.
   - off sedation, still not following commands or making purposeful
   movements
   - LP done earlier that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites,
   negative HSV PCR
   - CT scan did not show any focal lesions
   - likely will need MRI in the future but can not tolerate now [**12-21**]
   mental status/respiratory status
   - increase lactulose to TID, continue rifaximin
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN in the
   setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS. On
   albumin, mitodrine and octreotide per liver/renal.
   - urine output improving
   - giving mitodrine, octreotide and albumin
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], rree water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock.
   - CK and Trop trended down
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   ..
   # Gram negative bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin.
   - will continue surveillance blood cxs
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient had a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. Upon admission, the patient required intubation due to respiratory distress and inability to protect the airway. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since then. The patient also experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response during intubation, which responded to calcium gluconate. The patient's allergies include Demerol (Meperidine Hcl). The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 01/11/2145 at 08:16 PM, followed by Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 01/12/2145 at 06:27 AM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Fentanyl and Midazolam (Versed). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events described above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, requiring increased ventilatory support or alternative measures such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's previous cardiac arrest indicates a potential risk for recurrent arrhythmias or cardiac events, necessitating continuous cardiac monitoring and prompt intervention if any abnormalities are detected.
3. Renal Failure: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with complaints of altered mental status, respiratory distress, and hypotension. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. Upon admission, the patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to protect the airway. The patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response during the intubation process. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including renal failure, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are also abnormal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. This may lead to further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine and urea levels. This may require dialysis or other renal support measures.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia (low potassium), hyponatremia (low sodium), and hypercalcemia (high calcium). These imbalances can cause various complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and altered mental status.
4. Sepsis: The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension, which could be a sign of sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch-old with altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, and bacteremia. The patient has been sedated with propofol and midazolam. They have been receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam) for an infection. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 130/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 15 mmHg and fluid balance of 1,230 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows pH 7.52, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 410 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 29 mEq/L. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium (K+). The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is slightly elevated. The patient's other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may indicate delirium, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid restriction and adjustment of medications, should be implemented.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance indicates potential fluid overload. Careful monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent complications associated with fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, indicating an existing infection. Continued antibiotic therapy and source control measures should be implemented to treat the infection effectively.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate skin care should be provided to prevent this complication.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin, should be considered to prevent this complication.
8. Medication-related complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis hepatorenal syndrome, s/p
   PEA arrest, body cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with
   Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   - continue goal MAP >65
   - stable now after off pressors
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change.
   - pt will likely need trach if long-term care is the goal
   - cont 5-day total course of vanc/zosyn
   - cont local care
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, leukocytosis starting to resolve
   - on vanco/zosyn for total 5-day course
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  Back to pre-code
   MS per wife.
   - off sedation, still not following commands or making purposeful
   movements
   - LP done earlier that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites,
   negative HSV PCR
   - CT scan did not show any focal lesions
   - likely will need MRI in the future but can not tolerate now [**12-21**]
   mental status/respiratory status
   - increase lactulose to TID, continue rifaximin
   .
   # Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN in the
   setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS. On
   albumin, mitodrine and octreotide per liver/renal.
   - urine output improving
   - giving mitodrine, octreotide and albumin
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], rree water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock.
   - CK and Trop trended down
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   ..
   # Gram negative bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin.
   - will continue surveillance blood cxs
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, famotidine
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals today
   re: long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and recent cardiopulmonary arrest.
- The patient was initially hemodynamically stable but experienced episodes of hypotension unresponsive to IV fluid boluses. He is currently off pressors and has a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65.
- The patient required reintubation due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. He is unlikely to tolerate extubation, and a tracheostomy may be necessary for long-term care.
- The patient has pneumonia with a right lower lobe infiltrate and leukocytosis that is starting to resolve. He is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for a total 5-day course.
- The patient's mental status is slowly resolving, but he remains delirious and non-responsive. A head CT scan did not show any focal lesions, and an EEG was negative for seizure.
- The patient has renal failure with an unclear etiology, likely a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of cardiopulmonary arrest and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). He is receiving albumin, midodrine, and octreotide per liver/renal recommendations.
- The patient has hypernatremia, likely hypovolemic in the setting of recent ATN and current HRS. A"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest, body
   cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming. Trended cardiac enzymes, came down
   and no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo.
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR.
   - cont 5-day total course of vanc/zosyn
   - giving Lasix 40mg IV with goal -1L (will need to give addition dose
   in setting of getting 1u PRBC and 2u FFP)
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, leukocytosis starting to resolve
   - on vanco/zosyn for total 5-day course
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin.
   - will continue surveillance blood cxs
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife.
   - patient is following commands, on propofol sedation
   - CT scan did not show any focal lesions
   - likely will need MRI in the future but can not tolerate now [**12-21**]
   mental status/respiratory status
   - increase lactulose
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.

1. Respiratory/Ventilation: The patient was re-intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. A tracheostomy is planned for [**1-13**] in the operating room. The patient has pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow secretions, along with leukocytosis starting to resolve. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for a total of 5-day course.

3. Gram-negative bacteremia: The patient will be treated for two-week course, awaiting sensitivities on Fusobacterium, likely responsive to penicillin. Surveillance blood cultures will be done.

4. Mental Status: The patient had a slowly resolving delirium prior to the event and now with unclear hypoxic insult to the brain. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6-27 on admission to the ICU. A head CT was performed, which did not show any focal lesions. The patient is following commands, on"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest, body
   cooling and rewarming, concern for PNA covering with Vanc/Zosyn.
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming. Trended cardiac enzymes, came down
   and no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo.
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR.
   - cont 5-day total course of vanc/zosyn
   - giving Lasix 40mg IV with goal -1L (will need to give addition dose
   in setting of getting 1u PRBC and 2u FFP)
   .
   # Pneumonia
 on CXR has RLL infiltrate and bronch with thick yellow
   secretions, leukocytosis starting to resolve
   - on vanco/zosyn for total 5-day course
   - follow up cultures
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin.
   - will continue surveillance blood cxs
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife.
   - patient is following commands, on propofol sedation
   - CT scan did not show any focal lesions
   - likely will need MRI in the future but can not tolerate now [**12-21**]
   mental status/respiratory status
   - increase lactulose
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: NPO [**1-13**] for trach in OR, resume TF
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, famotidine
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals today
   re: long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a PEA arrest, body cooling, and rewarming. The patient was initially hemodynamically stable but later developed hypotension that did not respond to intravenous fluids. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been treated for pneumonia, gram-negative bacteremia, and mental status changes. There are concerns about hepatic veno-occlusive disease, hypernatremia, and potential brain injury. The patient's condition is still unstable, and further evaluation and treatment are required.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of pulmonary edema. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and difficulty handling secretions.
2. Infection: The patient has been treated for pneumonia and gram-negative bacteremia. There is a risk of developing additional infections, particularly in the setting of prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Hepatic Complications: The patient has a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and there are concerns about hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Monitoring liver function and managing complications related to cirrhosis is important.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient has experienced mental status changes and there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient underwent an emergency tracheostomy and received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the operating room. The patient is currently on propofol sedation and has been intubated since admission. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/65 mmHg to 165/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, total intake of 3,425 mL, total output of 3,890 mL, and urine output of 3,890 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 235, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 94. The patient's blood work reveals a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.2 g/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 112 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 4.1 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 117 mg/dL. The patient's other lab results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. It is crucial to monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely to ensure adequate respiratory support.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has altered mental status and a history of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and sodium, are abnormal. Regular monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances are essential to prevent complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a diagnosis of bacteremia. Infection control measures should be implemented, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat and prevent further infections.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent complications associated with fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at times, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate hemodynamic support are necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.
7. Tracheostomy Complications: Although not mentioned in the progress note, tracheostomy complications such as bleeding, infection, or displacement of the tube should be considered and monitored for.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential complications based on"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis who experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. He also received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) intraoperatively.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: The patient had mild bleeding around the tracheostomy site during the procedure, resulting in a loss of 150cc. The patient's INR is being monitored, and FFP is given as needed. No additional FFP will be given since the INR is within normal range.
2. Respiratory/Ventilation: The patient was reintubated on [**1-11**] due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. It is unlikely that the patient will tolerate extubation as the underlying problem is the inability to handle secretions. A chest X-ray from [**1-13**] showed evidence of pulmonary edema.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PEA) arrest, body cooling, and rewarming. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. The patient had a tracheostomy placed and received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) intraoperatively. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device.

The patient's allergies include Demerol (Meperidine Hcl). He has been receiving antibiotics, specifically Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and now for fusobacterium sepsis. The treatment for HAP was completed after 5 days, and Vancomycin was stopped on [**1-14**], while continuing with Zosyn until sensitivities of fusobacterium are obtained.

The patient's current medications include propofol sedation, furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management, and prophylactic H2 antagonist switched to PPI due to thrombocytopenia. His recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin levels, and prolonged PT/INR. There are also abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including hypernatremia and hypokalemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, cardiac arrest, bacteremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and electrolyte/fluid disorder.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/57 mmHg to 161/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, IV fluids, and respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube.
- Lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, liver enzymes, and electrolyte levels.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 1,643 mL over the past 24 hours.
- The patient has been monitored closely with frequent assessments of vital signs, respiratory support, and lab results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation support.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored for any deterioration, as acute renal failure can lead to further complications such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 136/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is arousable to voice, opens eyes, and withdraws to pain, but does not have any purposeful movements. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The blood cultures grew fusobacterium, which is pan-sensitive to IV penicillin. The patient has been started on IV penicillin. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,647 mL and output of 6,290 mL over the past 24 hours. His urine output is 5,990 mL. The patient has been receiving IV fluids, including normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory support is providing adequate oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest, body
   cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with Zosyn
   until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- lost 150cc intraop. surgery following,
   continue sedation to prevent movement, giving 2u platelets, given 1u
   FFP
   -          will not give additional FFP since INR 1.6
   -          ENT consult to eval for concern of posterior pharynx, giving
   affirm, lidocaine spray
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empire HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**]. Stopped vanc [**1-14**], continuing zosyn until sensitivities of
   fusobacterium.
   - giving Lasix 40mg IV with goal -1L
   .
   # Fusobacterium sepsis: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**]. Covering with zosyn until
   sensitivies obtained.
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   .
   # thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platlets 171, now 44. Switched from H2 to
   PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   -          obtaining smear
   -
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.
   - patient is following commands, on propofol sedation
   - likely will need MRI in the future but can not tolerate now [**12-21**]
   mental status/respiratory status
   - increase lactulose
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - switching antibiotics to be made with D5W
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming. Trended cardiac enzymes, came down
   and no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: NPO [**1-13**] for trach in OR, resume TF
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, PPI
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals today
   re: long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis who experienced a post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) and was body-cooled and rewarmed. The patient has been diagnosed with Fusobacterium sepsis and is currently being treated with intravenous antibiotics until sensitivities are obtained. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, mental status changes, respiratory distress requiring re-intubation, renal failure, hypernatremia, cardiac issues, cirrhosis with concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and an incidental finding of a parotid mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of laboratory parameters will help detect any signs of infection.

2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and previous bleeding from the tracheostomy site indicate a risk for bleeding complications. Platelet transfusion has been given, but further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent bleeding episodes.

3. Respiratory problems: The patient's respiratory distress and need for re-intubation indicate a potential risk for ongoing respiratory issues. Monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation parameters, and frequent chest X-rays will be important in managing the patient's respiratory status.

4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal failure may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis who has experienced multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has ongoing red congealed blood oozing from the tracheostomy site. There was also a concern of posterior pharynx bleed, which was ruled out by ENT evaluation. This suggests a risk of bleeding due to the patient's underlying liver disease and potential coagulopathy.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient required reintubation due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. This indicates a risk of respiratory failure and the need for continued ventilatory support.

3. Fusobacterium Sepsis: The patient is being treated for fusobacterium sepsis, which is a serious bacterial infection. There is a risk of complications such as septic shock and organ failure if not appropriately managed.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly from 171 on [**1-1**] to 44 currently. This suggests a risk of bleeding due to low platelet count and may require further investigation and intervention.

5. Mental Status Changes: The patient has a history of delirium and now shows unclear hypoxic insult to the brain. Mental status changes can occur due to various causes, including brain injury, sepsis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, body cooling, and rewarming. He was treated for Fusobacterium sepsis with intravenous penicillin until January 21st. The patient had bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which required surgical intervention. He was reintubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, mental status changes, resolved renal failure, hypernatremia, cardiac issues, cirrhosis, and a parotid mass. Other medical conditions include metabolic acidosis, and he is currently receiving ICU care with nutritional support and prophylactic measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheostomy site infection or bleeding: The patient had bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which required surgical intervention. There is a risk of infection at the tracheostomy site, which could lead to further complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he was reintubated due to respiratory distress. There is a risk of ongoing respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. It is important to monitor for any signs of bleeding or bruising.
4. Mental status changes:"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M who has continued AMS to point where not
   communicating at all; with hx Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest,
   body cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with IV
   Pen G until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.
   - patient is following commands, off propofol sedation, psych saw
   patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the patient was very unlikely to have had
   NMS and recommended seroquel to be used for agitation.
   - starting seroquel today
   - plan for MRI today
   - continue max dose of lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empire HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**]. Stopped vanc [**1-14**], continuing zosyn until sensitivities of
   fusobacterium.
   - giving Lasix 40mg IV with goal -2L
   - tolerating trach collar today very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium sepsis: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**]. Covered with zosyn until
   sensitivies obtained.
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN until [**1-21**]
   .
   # thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platlets 171, now 44. Switched from H2 to
   PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - obtaining smear
   - plts starting to improve slightly after switch
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - switching antibiotics to be made with D5W
   - cont free water flushes q3 hr through G tube
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming. Trended cardiac enzymes, came down
   and no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: TF running at goal, 60cc/hr
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, PPI
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals re:
   long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis who experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He was subsequently diagnosed with Fusobacterium sepsis, for which he received intravenous penicillin G until January 21st. The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress and was placed on mechanical ventilation. He underwent tracheostomy placement and is now tolerating the tracheostomy collar well. The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia, which has slightly improved after switching from H2 to PPI. His renal function has improved, and he no longer shows signs of renal failure. He was treated for hypernatremia by correcting the free water deficit and switching antibiotics to be made with D5W. The patient's cardiac enzymes trended down, and there is no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo. He has cirrhosis with concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). An incidental finding of a left parotid mass on MRI will require ENT follow-up as an outpatient. The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved. He has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen central line and arterial line. The patient is currently on full code status and is being kept in the ICU for ongoing care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. The patient has multiple medical complications including bleeding from the tracheostomy site, respiratory/vibration issues, Fusobacterium sepsis, thrombocytopenia, mental status changes, renal failure, hypernatremia, cardiac concerns, cirrhosis, parotid mass, metabolic acidosis, and access issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: The patient continues to have red congealed blood oozing from the tracheostomy site despite previous procedures and interventions.
2. Respiratory/vibration issues: The patient is re-intubated secondary to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. There is evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.
3. Fusobacterium sepsis: The patient is being treated for a two-week course of antibiotics due to Fusobacterium sepsis, which is likely responsive to penicillin.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly from 171 to 44. HIT or splenic sequestration could be potential causes.
5. Mental status changes: The patient has slowly resolving delirium prior to the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hep C cirrhosis, small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and previous cervical laminectomy. He was admitted for falls and underwent a procedure called laminectomy but did not recover motor function. The patient also experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest one week ago due to a mucous plug and was intubated but failed extubation once. He has been agitated and required an increase in propofol dosage. The patient has a psychiatric history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and has been prescribed Seroquel instead of Haldol. 

24-hour events:
The patient received antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and penicillin G potassium. He was also given infusions of propofol and furosemide (Lasix). 

Review of Systems:
The patient has no respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea. He is not delirious or unresponsive. 

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/66 to 128/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a central venous pressure (CVP)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of hep C cirrhosis, small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and previous cervical laminectomy. He was admitted for falls and underwent laminectomy but did not recover motor skills. He had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest one week ago due to a mucous plug and required intubation. The patient has been experiencing episodic agitation, requiring an increase in propofol. He has a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and is currently on seroquel instead of haldol.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 163/66 mmHg to 191/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,016 mL with outputs totaling 5,960 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,944 mL. The patient has received multiple antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and penicillin G potassium.

Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, warm skin, and no muscle wasting. Neurological assessment indicates that the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to noxious stimuli, and movement and tone are not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. Blood cultures grew fusobacterium. Other lab values, including liver function tests and blood gases, are provided in the note.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient is well on lactulose and seroquel for agitation. Consider MRI to work up anoxic brain injury.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is doing well on a tracheostomy mask.
3. Acute renal failure: Improved.
4. HCV cirrhosis: ICU care will focus on nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening encephalopathy, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hepatic complications related to HCV cirrhosis, and infections such as VAP or DVT."

   communicating at all; with hx Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest,
   body cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with IV
   Pen G until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.  MRI
   ([**1-16**]) was unremarkable.
   - patient not responding to pain or consistently following commands,
   off propofol sedation, psych saw patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the
   patient was very unlikely to have had NMS and recommended seroquel to
   be used for agitation.
   - d/c propofol (still intermittently using)
   - continue max dose of lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empiric HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**].
    - giving Lasix 40mg IV with goal -2L
   - tolerating trach collar very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium sepsis: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**]. Covered with zosyn until
   sensitivies obtained.
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN on [**1-21**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platelets 171, slowly declining. Switched
   from H2 to PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - f/u smear
   - no current evidence of DIC
   - plts starting to improve slightly after switch from H2 to PPI
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - switching antibiotics to be made with D5W
   - increase free water boluses through G-tube
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming. Trended cardiac enzymes, came down
   and no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: TF running at goal, 60cc/hr
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, PPI
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals re:
   long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a post-cardiac arrest syndrome and was resuscitated. He has been in the ICU since then and has been diagnosed with various medical complications. The patient's current conditions include acute mental status changes, respiratory distress requiring reintubation, bleeding from the tracheostomy site, Fusobacterium sepsis, thrombocytopenia, resolved renal failure, hypernatremia, cardiac issues post-arrest, cirrhosis with concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), parotid mass, metabolic acidosis, and prolonged ICU stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute mental status changes: The patient has shown fluctuating levels of consciousness and confusion, which may be due to hypoxic insult to the brain, encephalopathy, or delirium.
2. Respiratory distress and need for reintubation: The patient's respiratory system is compromised, leading to repeated episodes of respiratory distress. He requires ongoing mechanical ventilation support through the tracheostomy.
3. Bleeding from the tracheostomy site: The patient experienced bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which required intervention and administration of blood products.
4. Fusobacterium sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with Fusobacterium sepsis, a serious bacterial infection that requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M who has continued AMS to point where not
   communicating at all; with hx Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest,
   body cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with IV
   Pen G until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.  MRI
   ([**1-16**]) was unremarkable.
   - patient is following commands, off propofol sedation, psych saw
   patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the patient was very unlikely to have had
   NMS and recommended seroquel to be used for agitation.
   - continue max dose of lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empire HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**]. Stopped vanc [**1-14**], continuing zosyn until sensitivities of
   fusobacterium.
   - giving Lasix 40mg IV with goal -2L
   - tolerating trach collar very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium sepsis: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**]. Covered with zosyn until
   sensitivies obtained.
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN until [**1-21**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platlets 171, now 44. Switched from H2 to
   PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - f/u smear
   - plts starting to improve slightly after switch
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - switching antibiotics to be made with D5W
   - cont free water flushes q3 hr through G tube
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming. Trended cardiac enzymes, came down
   and no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: TF running at goal, 60cc/hr

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent hypotension. The patient was cooled and rewarmed, and treated for Fusobacterium sepsis. He has ongoing mental status changes, respiratory distress requiring reintubation, thrombocytopenia, resolved renal failure, hypernatremia, cardiac issues, and parotid mass. The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had Fusobacterium sepsis, which was treated with intravenous Pen G until January 21st. It is important to monitor for any signs of recurrent sepsis.
2. Delirium: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he is currently non-communicative. Delirium may persist or worsen, and close monitoring of his mental status is necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required reintubation due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. He is currently on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and further respiratory support may be needed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is significantly low. Continued monitoring of platelet levels and bleeding risks is essential. Transfusion of platelets or other blood products may be required to maintain adequate clot"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with a current temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate ranging from 74 to 102 beats per minute, blood pressure fluctuating between 104/55 and 175/134 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16 and 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,610 mL, output of 4,620 mL, and a negative balance of 1,010 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's recent laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's neurological status is described as arousable to voice, opening eyes, but with no purposeful movements or verbal communication. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's agitation and altered mental status indicate a potential risk for delirium, which can be associated with ICU stay and exposure to various medications or interventions.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an infection, such as bacteremia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis who experienced a postoperative cardiac arrest and required ventilation. He has been unresponsive with poor motor score (MS) and has shown desaturation episodes. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/64 to 175/134 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask with supplemental oxygen. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, warm skin, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurological examination shows no follow-up commands or response to noxious stimuli. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.6 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 59. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging studies are unremarkable.

The patient has been diagnosed with Fusobacterium sepsis and is receiving Penicillin G. Efforts are being made to limit sedation and provide bolus nutrition. The patient's hypernatremia is being addressed by repleting free water while diuresing. The patient's thrombocytopenia has improved. The patient's code status is"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M who has continued AMS to point where not
   communicating at all; with hx Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest,
   body cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with IV
   Pen G until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.  MRI
   ([**1-16**]) was unremarkable.
   - patient not responding to pain or consistently following commands,
   off propofol sedation, psych saw patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the
   patient was very unlikely to have had NMS and recommended seroquel to
   be used for agitation.
   - d/c propofol (still intermittently using)
   - continue max dose of lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empiric HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**].
    - giving Lasix 40mg IV with goal -2L
   - tolerating trach collar very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium sepsis: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**]. Covered with zosyn until
   sensitivies obtained.
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN on [**1-21**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platelets 171, slowly declining. Switched
   from H2 to PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - f/u smear
   - no current evidence of DIC
   - plts starting to improve slightly after switch from H2 to PPI
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - switching antibiotics to be made with D5W
   - increase free water boluses through G-tube
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming. Trended cardiac enzymes, came down
   and no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: TF running at goal, 60cc/hr
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, PPI
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals re:
   long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent cooling and rewarming. The patient has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Mental status: The patient is not communicating at all, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ranging from 6 to 27 on admission to the ICU. There is a possibility of anoxic brain injury due to hypoxic insult during the arrest.
2. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: The patient experienced bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which was addressed by replacing the tracheostomy tube and administering blood products.
3. Respiratory/ventilation: The patient was reintubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is tolerating the tracheostomy collar well.
4. Fusobacterium sepsis: The patient is being treated for fusobacterium sepsis, which was diagnosed on January 7th. He will receive a two-week course of antibiotics until January 21st.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slowly declining. HIT vs. splenic sequestration is being considered as possible causes. The patient is being followed up with a smear and no evidence of disseminated intravascular"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M who has continued AMS to point where not
   communicating at all; with hx Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest,
   body cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with IV
   Pen G until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.  MRI
   ([**1-16**]) was unremarkable.
   - patient not responding to pain or consistently following commands,
   off propofol sedation, psych saw patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the
   patient was very unlikely to have had NMS and recommended seroquel to
   be used for agitation.
   - d/c propofol (still intermittently using)
   - continue max dose of lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empiric HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**].
    - giving Lasix 40mg IV with goal -2L
   - tolerating trach collar very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium sepsis: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**]. Covered with zosyn until
   sensitivies obtained.
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN on [**1-21**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platelets 171, slowly declining. Switched
   from H2 to PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - f/u smear
   - no current evidence of DIC
   - plts starting to improve slightly after switch from H2 to PPI
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit ~ 2-3L.
   - switching antibiotics to be made with D5W
   - increase free water boluses through G-tube
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: After PEA, was initially hemodynamically stable
   but has had episodes of hypotension non-responsive to IVF boluses,
   levofed started, currently off. Echo showed no evidence of cardiogenic
   shock. s/p cooling and rewarming. Trended cardiac enzymes, came down
   and no evidence of cardiogenic shock on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: TF running at goal, 60cc/hr
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, PPI
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals re:
   long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, subsequent hypothermia and rewarming, and was diagnosed with Fusobacterium sepsis. The patient has had multiple complications including delirium, bleeding from the tracheostomy site, respiratory distress leading to reintubation, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, hypernatremia, cardiac issues, liver disease, parotid mass, metabolic acidosis, and an incidental finding of a left parotid mass on MRI. The patient's condition remains critical and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he is still agitated despite being off propofol sedation.
2. Bleeding: The patient experienced bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which required intervention and blood product transfusion. There was also a concern for posterior pharynx bleed, but it was not found during the ENT evaluation.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient required reintubation due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. It is unlikely that he will tolerate extubation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a declining platelet count, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Renal Failure: The patient had unclear etiology renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M who has continued AMS to point where not
   communicating at all; with hx Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest,
   body cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with IV
   Pen G until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.  MRI
   ([**1-16**]) was unremarkable.
   - patient not consistently following commands, off propofol sedation,
   psych saw patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the patient was very unlikely
   to have had NMS and recommended seroquel to be used for agitation
   will uptitrate per Psych recs
 standing Seroquel TID
   - propofol off
   - increase lactulose to 60mg q2hr for stool ouput goal of 1000cc and
   cont rifaximin
   - Will check thyroid studies and ammonia as cause of AMS
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved, tr blood at site, but controlled
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empiric HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**].
   - tolerating trach collar very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**].
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN on [**1-21**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platelets 171, slowly declining. Switched
   from H2 to PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - no current evidence of DIC
   - plts stable after switch from H2 to PPI
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit 3.5L on
   [**2145-1-18**]
   - increase free water boluses through G-tube to provide 3.5L by
   tomorrow PM
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: Now stable. After PEA, was initially
   hemodynamically stable but has had episodes of hypotension
   non-responsive to IVF boluses, levofed started, currently off. Echo
   showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   Trended cardiac enzymes, came down and no evidence of cardiogenic shock
   on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: TF running at goal, 60cc/hr
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, PPI
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals re:
   long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, who presented with multiple medical complications. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, underwent cooling and rewarming, and was diagnosed with Fusobacterium sepsis. The patient required reintubation due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. He also had bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which was controlled. The patient has thrombocytopenia, resolved renal failure, hypernatremia, cardiac issues, liver cirrhosis with concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), parotid mass, metabolic acidosis, and multiple lines and tubes in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Bleeding: The patient had bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which could be a concern if the clotting factors are not properly managed.
3. Respiratory Issues: The patient required reintubation and has difficulty handling secretions, which may indicate ongoing respiratory problems.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has liver cirrhosis and concerns for HRS, which can lead to further complications such as encephalopathy and renal dysfunction.
6. Cardiac Issues:"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M who has continued AMS to point where not
   communicating at all; with hx Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest,
   body cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with IV
   Pen G until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.  MRI
   ([**1-16**]) was unremarkable.
   - patient not consistently following commands, off propofol sedation,
   psych saw patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the patient was very unlikely
   to have had NMS and recommended seroquel to be used for agitation
   will uptitrate per Psych recs
 standing Seroquel TID
   - propofol off
   - increase lactulose to 60mg q2hr for stool ouput goal of 1000cc and
   cont rifaximin
   - Will check thyroid studies and ammonia as cause of AMS
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved, tr blood at site, but controlled
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empiric HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**].
   - tolerating trach collar very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**].
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN on [**1-21**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platelets 171, slowly declining. Switched
   from H2 to PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - no current evidence of DIC
   - plts stable after switch from H2 to PPI
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit 3.5L on
   [**2145-1-18**]
   - increase free water boluses through G-tube to provide 3.5L by
   tomorrow PM
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - titrate up lactulose
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: Now stable. After PEA, was initially
   hemodynamically stable but has had episodes of hypotension
   non-responsive to IVF boluses, levofed started, currently off. Echo
   showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   Trended cardiac enzymes, came down and no evidence of cardiogenic shock
   on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: PIV, Central Line
   .
   # FEN: TF running at goal, 60cc/hr
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, PPI
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals re:
   long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.

   effusion and atelectasis, though in the absence of a lateral view. A
   superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. The left hemidiaphragm is
   more sharply seen, suggesting some improvement in atelectasis and
   effusion in this region.

   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.  MRI
   ([**1-16**]) was unremarkable.  Mental status is somewhat improved today.
   - off propofol sedation,
   - psych saw patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the patient was very unlikely
   to have had NMS and recommended seroquel for agitation (uptitrate per
   Psych recs
 standing Seroquel TID with prns)
   - lactulose increased to 60mg q4hr for stool ouput goal of 1000cc and
   cont rifaximin; ammonia not elevated
   - Thyroid studies wnl
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empiric HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**].
   - tolerating trach collar very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**].
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN on [**1-21**]
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved, tr blood at site, but controlled
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit 3.5L on
   [**2145-1-18**] and now corrected again as TF were held overnight except for FW
   boluses..
   - increase free water boluses through G-tube
   - will discuss with nutrition to see if there is a way to decrease
   sodium in TF or dilute TF to prevent hypernatremia
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platelets 171, slowly declining. Switched
   from H2 to PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - no current evidence of DIC
   - plts stable after switch from H2 to PPI
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - lactulose increased
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: Now stable. After PEA, was initially
   hemodynamically stable but has had episodes of hypotension
   non-responsive to IVF boluses, levofed started, currently off. Echo
   showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   Trended cardiac enzymes, came down and no evidence of cardiogenic shock
   on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: Central Line and A-line; will remove A-line today and request
   PICC placement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and subsequent body cooling and rewarming. The patient has multiple medical complications including delirium, respiratory distress requiring re-intubation with a tracheostomy, Fusobacterium bacteremia, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, resolved renal failure, cardiac issues, cirrhosis with concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), parotid mass, metabolic acidosis, and access-related concerns.

The patient's mental status has been slowly improving, but there is ongoing confusion and delirium. The patient's respiratory status is stable with a tracheostomy in place, and he is tolerating the trach collar well. The patient is being treated for Fusobacterium bacteremia with a planned 14-day course of penicillin.

Hypernatremia has been corrected, and free water deficit is being managed with intravenous free water boluses. Thrombocytopenia is present, with platelet counts slowly declining, but the patient's platelet levels have stabilized after switching from H2 to PPI. Renal function has improved, and the patient is off albumin, midodrine, and octreotide.

Cardiac enzymes have trended down, and there is no evidence of cardiogenic shock. The patient has a history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, body cooling, and rewarming. He was treated for Fusobacterium sepsis with intravenous penicillin until January 21st. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, but he still has underlying issues such as cirrhosis and potential anoxic brain injury. He is currently intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. The patient also has hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, resolved renal failure, cardiac concerns, parotid mass, access issues, and nutritional challenges. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions. This indicates a potential ongoing respiratory complication.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient has been treated for Fusobacterium sepsis, there is still a risk of developing new infections or septicemia due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Liver failure: The patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis suggests that he may have ongoing liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Renal failure: Although"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 y/o M who has continued AMS to point where not
   communicating at all; with hx Hepatitis C cirrhosis, s/p PEA arrest,
   body cooling and rewarming, with Fusobacterium sepsis covering with IV
   Pen G until [**2145-1-21**].
   .
   # Mental Status: With slowly resolving delerium prior to this event,
   and now with unclear hypoxic insult to brain. GCS of [**6-27**] on admission
   to ICU.  Considering head CT to evaluate for anoxic brain injury
   post-cooling.  Neuro eval for possible seizure. EEG neg for seizure,
   severe encephalopathy likely in setting of sedation.  LP done earlier
   that was negative gram stain/culture, no whites, negative HSV PCR. Back
   to pre-code MS per wife. CT scan did not show any focal lesions.  MRI
   ([**1-16**]) was unremarkable.  Mental status is somewhat improved today.
   - off propofol sedation,
   - psych saw patient on [**1-15**] and felt that the patient was very unlikely
   to have had NMS and recommended seroquel for agitation (uptitrate per
   Psych recs
 standing Seroquel TID with prns)
   - lactulose increased to 60mg q4hr for stool ouput goal of 1000cc and
   cont rifaximin; ammonia not elevated
   - Thyroid studies wnl
   .
   # Respiratory/Ventilation: Pt re-intubated [**1-11**] secondary to
   respiratory distress and inability to handle secretions.  Unlikely to
   tolerate extubation given that underlying problem is inability to
   handle secretions which is unlikely to change. CXR from [**1-13**] showed
   evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient getting trach [**1-13**] in OR. Patient
   completed treatment for empiric HAP for 5day with vanc/zosyn starting
   [**1-7**].
   - tolerating trach collar very well
   .
   # Fusobacterium bacteremia: Will treat for two-week course, awaiting
   sensitivities on Fusobacterium -> likely responsive to penicillin. Dx
   on [**1-7**], will need 14d course until [**1-21**].
   - surveillance blood cxs NTD
   - complete course of PCN on [**1-21**]
   .
   # bleeding from trach site- Procedure done [**1-13**], 8-0 Portex .lost
   150cc. Patient was given giving 2u platelets, given 1u FFP after the
   procedure. ENT was consulted on [**1-14**] for concern of posterior pharynx
   bleed, which they did not find any evidence of.
   - bleeding has improved, tr blood at site, but controlled
   - ENT found small bite on back of tongue, but no evidence of posterior
   pharynx bleed
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia in the setting of
   recent ATN and current HRS.  Corrected [**1-11**], free water deficit 3.5L on
   [**2145-1-18**] and now corrected again as TF were held overnight except for FW
   boluses..
   - increase free water boluses through G-tube
   - will discuss with nutrition to see if there is a way to decrease
   sodium in TF or dilute TF to prevent hypernatremia
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 [**1-1**] platelets 171, slowly declining. Switched
   from H2 to PPI. Considering HIT vs. splenic sequestration
   - no current evidence of DIC
   - plts stable after switch from H2 to PPI
   .
   # Resolved Renal Failure: Unclear etiology, likely combination of ATN
   in the setting of code and HRS.  Renal following given concern for HRS.
   Off albumin, mitodrine and octreotide
   - renal function stable
   - f/u renal and liver recs
   .
   # Cardiac: CE's trended post-arrest. Echo hyperdynamic, no cardiogenic
   shock. CK and Trop trended down
   - will consider repeat echo
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Hep C Cirrhosis, with concern for HRS.
   - pre-code mental status likely related to encephalopathy v. delirium
   - lactulose increased
   - liver recs -> non suitable for tx at this point, in the very small
   chance that pt improves could possibly be candidate in the future
   .
   # s/p Shock/PEA Arrest: Now stable. After PEA, was initially
   hemodynamically stable but has had episodes of hypotension
   non-responsive to IVF boluses, levofed started, currently off. Echo
   showed no evidence of cardiogenic shock. s/p cooling and rewarming.
   Trended cardiac enzymes, came down and no evidence of cardiogenic shock
   on rewarmed echo.
   # Parotid mass. Incidental finding of L parotid mass on MRI, 1.6cm. --
   Will require ENT followup as outpt.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: s/p arrest [**12-21**] to tissue hypoxia.  Lactates now
   normalized, now resolved.
   # Access: Central Line and A-line; will remove A-line today and request
   PICC placement.
   .
   # FEN: were stopped due to patient positioning, will try restarting
   today for goal, 60cc/hr
               Speech/swallow c/s for consideration of passy-muir valve.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: holding HSQ since elevated PTT, PPI
   .
   # Code: full
   .
   # Communication: Wife is HCP -> will readdress long-term goals re:
   long-term prognosis
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now.  [**Month (only) 11**] be able to transition to floor vs.
   rehab soon.
