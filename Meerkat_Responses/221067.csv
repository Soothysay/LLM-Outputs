   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo F with HTN, dCHF, CKD, h/o guaiac-positive stools, transferred
   from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**] for cardiac catheterization in the setting of elevated
   cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) **] to have 3-vessel disease.
   .
   # NSTEMI: Troponin peaked at 0.26. Cath shows 3-vessel disease. Poor
   candidate for PCI given 3VD and history of GI bleeding.
   -CT surgery evaluation for possible CABG/MVR
   -ASA
   -no Plavix given surgical evaluation
   -statin
   -beta blocker
   -holding ACE for now in setting of renal failure

   # Chest pain: Patient has recurrent chest pain responsive to NTG SL x
   1. If this is [**Name13 (STitle) 11581**] pain, the patient will need to be managed
   medically vs. with CABG as her coronary anatomy is not amenable to PCI.
   -nitro PRN
   -identify and treat non-cardiac causes of chest pain (i.e. GERD)
   -consider long-acting nitrate is patient opts for medical management
   .
   # Acute on chronic mitral regurgitation: Echo shows new focal wall
   motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of [**Name13 (STitle) 11581**] etiology.
   Currently hypervolemic.  Ddx for worsened MR [**First Name (Titles) 11582**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11581**] (in
   setting of troponin rise) vs. infectious (in setting of fevers).
   Patient currently afebrile.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. The cardiac catheterization showed 3-vessel disease. 

The patient's current condition includes recurrent chest pain responsive to nitroglycerin sublingual and intravenous nitroglycerin infusion. She has acute on chronic mitral regurgitation with new focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of ischemic etiology. The patient is hypervolemic and needs blood pressure control with beta blockers, supplemental oxygen, diuresis with IV Lasix, follow-up pending blood cultures, evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or mitral valve replacement (MVR), and consideration for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if considering valve surgery. 

The patient is in sinus rhythm but has an unclear history of atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. She also has chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 and needs renal dosing of medications, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and trending of creatinine levels. 

Other issues include diarrhea, possibly due to an infectious etiology or gut ischemia or edema from CHF, and polymyalgia"

","Based on the provided physician progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, dilated congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation.

The patient has been diagnosed with extensive 3-vessel disease and is not a candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to the 3-vessel disease and history of gastrointestinal bleeding. A cardiac surgery evaluation is being conducted for possible coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or mitral valve replacement (MVR).

The patient's current medical conditions include acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure/worsened mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, diarrhea, polymyalgia rheumatica, and anxiety/depression.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for cardiac-related complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, and arrhythmias. Given the patient's chronic kidney disease, there is also a risk of further renal deterioration. The presence of diarrhea may indicate an infectious etiology, which could potentially lead to sepsis. Additionally, the patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of cardiovascular"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and previous guaiac-positive stools. She was admitted for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. 

The patient has been experiencing recurrent chest pain responsive to nitroglycerin, which indicates ongoing ischemic heart disease. She does not want to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and her coronary anatomy is not amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Therefore, medical management of her chest pain will be necessary.

The patient also has acute on chronic mitral regurgitation and heart failure, as evidenced by new focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR seen on echo. Endocarditis is less likely given negative blood cultures to date. The patient does not want valve surgery. 

Additionally, the patient has been in sinus rhythm with frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) and an unclear history of atrial fibrillation. She is not on anticoagulation. 

Other medical conditions include chronic kidney disease, diarrhea with possible infectious etiology, and polymyalgia rheumatica. 

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 164/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on"

- She was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR).
- Coronary angiography revealed 3-vessel disease, making her a poor candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) given her history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
- She is currently experiencing recurrent chest pain responsive to sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG).

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and a history of guaiac-positive stools. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. She has been diagnosed with three-vessel coronary artery disease.

The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, which is multifactorial and related to mitral regurgitation (4+ on recent echo) and pneumonia (CXR shows multifocal pneumonia). Antibiotics have been initiated for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient has recurrent chest pain responsive to nitroglycerin and does not want to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Medications have been adjusted to manage medically her condition.

The patient's troponin level peaked at 0.26, indicating a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She is a poor candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to three-vessel disease and history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently being managed medically.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure, with new focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of ischemic etiology. Endocarditis is less likely given negative blood cultures to date. The patient does not want valve surgery.

The patient is in sinus rhythm with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient's medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 102.9°F and exhibited signs of respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing episodes of food getting stuck in the esophagus while eating and regurgitation of partially digested food. The patient also reported having a large, black, guaiac-positive stool and ongoing chest pain. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, hydrocodone, and codeine. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected multifocal pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 118/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient's physical examination revealed sinus rhythm and peripheral pulses were not assessed.

   # Chest pain: Patient has recurrent chest pain that is not completely
   responsive to NTG. Etiology unclear: cardiac vs. related to pt
s PNA
   vs. related to dysphagia. Of note, pt was started on long-acting
   nitrate yesterday in an effort to better control her pain. Also,
   increased metprolol overnight.
   - continue metoprolol
   - increase imdur to 90 mg daily; consider giving dose at bedtime
   because pt seems to develop her chest discomfort at night
   - continue PRN ntg
   - consider further GI evaluation for potential dysphagia (see below)
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Pt will on NC and intermittently requiring NRB. Her
   hypoxemia likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation (4+ on
   recent echo) and pneumonia (CXR shows multifocal pneumonia).
   - f/u pending blood cultures and send second set prior to antibiotics
   - continue antibiotics for HAP: vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin (day
   1 = [**2161-2-18**])
   - treat heart failure/mitral regurgitation with diruesis and BP control
   - wean O2 as tolerated

   # Dysphagia: Yesterday evening, pt reported episodes of food
getting
   stuck
 in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food.
   She states that she has never mentioned this to her doctors in the
   past. Of note, there is some thought that the pt

   contributing to her chest discomfort at night.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization and was found to have three-vessel disease.

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:

1. Chest pain: The patient experiences recurrent chest pain, which is not completely responsive to nitroglycerin. The etiology of the chest pain is unclear, with possibilities including cardiac issues, pneumonia, or dysphagia. 

2. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, likely due to mitral regurgitation and pneumonia. She is on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPY) and requires intermittent NRB mask. 

3. Dysphagia: The patient reports episodes of food getting stuck in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food. This could be contributing to her chest discomfort at night.

4. NSTEMI: The patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), as indicated by peaked troponin levels. The patient's coronary angiography showed three-vessel disease, making her a poor candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient does not want coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including placement of a PICC line, administration of antibiotics, initiation of long-acting nitrates, and adjustment of medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain: The patient's recurrent chest pain is not completely responsive to nitroglycerin. The etiology is unclear, possibly related to cardiac issues or dysphagia. It is important to continue metoprolol, increase imdur to 90 mg daily, and provide NTG as needed. Further evaluation for potential dysphagia should be considered.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient requires non-rebreather oxygen and intermittent NRB due to multifactorial causes, including mitral regurgitation and pneumonia. Blood cultures and antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia should be continued. Diuretics and blood pressure control should be maintained to treat heart failure and mitral regurgitation.
3. NSTEMI: Troponin levels peaked at 0.26, and catheterization showed 3-vessel disease. The patient is a poor candidate for PCI and does not want coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The current plan includes ASA"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. The patient has a history of 3-vessel disease and was found to have troponin levels indicating a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is a poor candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and does not want coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient's chest pain is not completely responsive to nitroglycerin (NTG). She also has multifocal pneumonia and acute on chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure, with new focal wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram. The patient does not want valve surgery. She is euvolemic to hypervolemic and in sinus rhythm with frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs). The patient has chronic kidney disease and is not on anticoagulation. She also has diarrhea, which may be due to an infectious etiology, and a history of polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient has anxiety and depression, for which she is taking medication. Her code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), and she is currently in the ICU.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, likely due to mitral regurgitation and pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and blood cultures are pending.

2. Chest pain: The patient has recurrent chest pain that responds to nitroglycerin (NTG). Given her coronary anatomy and preference against coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), medical management will be continued with increased metoprolol, Im Durant, and NTG as needed.

3. NSTEMI: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with troponin levels peaking at 0.26. Catheterization showed three-vessel disease, but the patient is not a candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to her poor condition and history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin (ASA) and a statin have been initiated, while Plavix has been withheld due to guaiac-positive stools.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. The patient has been diagnosed with 3-vessel disease.

The patient is experiencing several medical complications, including hypoxemia, chest pain, NSTEMI, acute on chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure, rhythm disturbances, chronic kidney disease, diarrhea, and anxiety/depression.

Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, which can be attributed to mitral regurgitation and pneumonia. Antibiotics have been prescribed for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Chest pain: The patient experiences recurrent chest pain that responds to nitroglycerin. Given her preference against coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and unsuitable coronary anatomy for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the chest pain will be managed medically.

NSTEMI: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, as indicated by a peak troponin level of 0.26. The patient is not a candidate for PCI due to 3-vessel disease and history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Medications such as aspirin, a statin, metoprolol, and indomethacin have been initiated.

   vs. related to dysphagia. Also likely some anxiety component. Of note,
   pt was started on long-acting nitrate yesterday in an effort to better
   control her pain. Also, increased metprolol overnight.
   - continue metoprolol
   - increase imdur to 90 mg daily; consider giving dose at bedtime

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding, was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. The patient has three-vessel disease.

The patient has experienced several medical complications since admission. She had an episode of chest pain that did not completely respond to nitroglycerin (NTG). Her chest pain may be related to cardiac issues, pneumonia, or dysphagia. She was started on a long-acting nitrate and had her metoprolol dose increased.

The patient also developed hypoxemia, likely due to mitral regurgitation and pneumonia. She is currently on non-rebreather oxygen therapy and requires intermittent NRB masks.

Her hematocrit dropped by 5 points overnight, indicating a possible decrease in red blood cells. This could be caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, considering her history of guaiac-positive stools, including a large one yesterday. She was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and crossmatched for additional units.

The patient reported episodes of food getting stuck in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food. This could be a new symptom or something she has not mentioned before. There is a possibility that her dysphagia is contributing to her chest discomfort at night"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo F with HTN, dCHF, CKD, h/o guaiac-positive stools, transferred
   from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**] for cardiac catheterization in the setting of elevated
   cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) **] to have 3-vessel disease.
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient has recurrent chest pain that is not completely
   responsive to NTG. Etiology unclear: cardiac vs. related to pt
s PNA
   vs. related to dysphagia. Also likely some anxiety component. Of note,
   pt was started on long-acting nitrate yesterday in an effort to better
   control her pain. Also, increased metprolol overnight.
   - continue metoprolol
   - increase imdur to 90 mg daily; consider giving dose at bedtime
   because pt seems to develop her chest discomfort at night
   - continue PRN ntg
   - consider further GI evaluation for potential dysphagia (see below)
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Pt will on NC and intermittently requiring NRB. Her
   hypoxemia likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation (4+ on
   recent echo) and pneumonia (CXR shows multifocal pneumonia).
   - f/u pending blood cultures and send second set prior to antibiotics
   - continue antibiotics for HAP: vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin (day
   1 = [**2161-2-18**])
   - treat heart failure/mitral regurgitation with diruesis and BP control
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Decreased Hematocrit: The patient had a 5 point drop in her
   hematocrit overnight. The most likely etiology for this is GI bleeding,
   in this patient with a history of guaiac positive stools (including a
   large guaiac positive stool yesterday).
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs now, f/u Hct after
   - crossmatched for 2 additional units
   - d/w pt her goals of care; consider GI consult
   - decreased heparin SQ and ASA doses
   - send additional stool sample for c.diff, considering patient
s recent
   diarrhea
   .
   # Dysphagia: Yesterday evening, pt reported episodes of food
getting
   stuck
 in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food.
   She states that she has never mentioned this to her doctors in the
   past. Of note, there is some thought that the pt
s dysphagia could be
   contributing to her chest discomfort at night.
   - d/w GI
   - consider further work-up while inpatient versus as an outpatient
   .
   # NSTEMI: Troponin peaked at 0.26. Cath shows 3-vessel disease. Poor
   candidate for PCI given 3VD and history of GI bleeding. Patient does
   not want CABG.
   - ASA (decreased dose as above)
   - no Plavix given guaiac positive stools
   - continue statin, metoprolol, Imdur
   - holding ACE for now; will consider adding if BP not control
   .
   # Acute on chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure: Echo shows new
   focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of ischemic
   etiology. Endocarditis less likely given blood cultures negative to
   date. Patient does not want valve surgery.
   - BP control with beta blocker, amlodipine, and Imdur
   - supplemental O2
   - diurese with IV Lasix (goal negative 1-2 L)
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine reportedly at baseline.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Polymyalgia rheumatica:
   -continue prednisone at home dose
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression:
   -continue nortriptaline and Zyprexa at home dose

   on:[**2161-2-19**] 18:39 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and a history of guaiac-positive stools. The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. She was found to have 3-vessel disease.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Chest pain: The patient experiences recurrent chest pain that is not completely responsive to nitroglycerin (NTG). The etiology of the chest pain is unclear, and it could be related to cardiac issues, pneumonia, or dysphagia. The patient's chest discomfort tends to occur at night, possibly due to anxiety or dysphagia.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation and pneumonia. She requires non-rebreather oxygen and intermittent NRB due to her condition.

3. Decreased hematocrit: The patient had a 5-point drop in her hematocrit overnight, which is most likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding. She has a history of guaiac-positive stools, including a large guaiac-positive stool yesterday. Immediate blood transfusion and further evaluation by a gastroenterology consultant are recommended.

4. Dysphagia: The patient reported episodes of food"

   - BP control with beta blocker, amlodipine, and Imdur
   - supplemental O2
   - diurese with IV Lasix (goal negative 1-2 L)
   - f/u pending blood cultures

   # Acute blood loss anemia: The patient had a 5 point drop in her
   hematocrit from [**2161-2-18**] to [**2161-2-19**]. Due to this Hct drop, received 1
   unit PRBCs with an appropriate increase in her hematocrit. The
   patient
s hematocrit has been stable since then. The most likely
   etiology of the patient
s Hct drop is GI bleeding, in this patient with
   a history of guaiac positive stools (including a large guaiac positive
   stool on [**2-18**])
   - follow Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - maintain active T+S; crossmatched for 2 additional units
   - appreciate GI recs
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - hold iron supplements
   - on lower doses of ASA and heparin SC
   - advance diet as Hct is stable
   .
   # Dysphagia: On [**2161-2-18**], the patient reported episodes of food
getting
   stuck
 in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food.
   She states that she has never mentioned this to her doctors in the
   past.  This may indicate esophageal pathology that may be contributing
   to the patient
s chest pain.
   - apprec GI recs
   - barium swallow when more stable
   .
   # NSTEMI: Troponin peaked at 0.26. Cath shows 3-vessel disease. Poor
   candidate for PCI given 3VD and history of GI bleeding. Patient does
   not want CABG.
   - ASA (decreased dose as above)
   - no Plavix given guaiac positive stools
   - continue statin, metoprolol, Imdur
   - holding ACE for now; will consider adding if BP not control
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine reportedly at baseline.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Polymyalgia rheumatica:
   -continue prednisone at home dose
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression:
   -continue nortriptaline and Zyprexa at home dose

   85 yo F with HTN, dCHF, CKD, h/o guaiac-positive stools, transferred
   from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**] for cardiac catheterization in the setting of elevated
   cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) **] to have 3-vessel disease.
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient has not had chest pain x 24 hours. Seems to be
   improved with metoprolol, Imdur, and diuresis.
   - continue metoprolol
   - continue imdur 90 mg at night
   - NTG SL PRN
   - work up GI causes of chest pain
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Pt will on NC and intermittently requiring NRB. Her
   hypoxemia likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation (4+ on
   recent echo) and pneumonia (CXR shows multifocal pneumonia).
   - f/u pending blood cultures and send second set prior to antibiotics
   - continue antibiotics for HAP: vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin (day
   1 = [**2161-2-18**])
   - treat heart failure/mitral regurgitation with diruesis and BP control
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Decreased Hematocrit: The patient had a 5 point drop in her
   hematocrit overnight. The most likely etiology for this is GI bleeding,
   in this patient with a history of guaiac positive stools (including a
   large guaiac positive stool yesterday).
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs now, f/u Hct after
   - crossmatched for 2 additional units
   - d/w pt her goals of care; consider GI consult
   - decreased heparin SQ and ASA doses
   - send additional stool sample for c.diff, considering patient
s recent
   diarrhea
   .
   # Dysphagia: Yesterday evening, pt reported episodes of food
getting
   stuck
 in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food.
   She states that she has never mentioned this to her doctors in the
   past. Of note, there is some thought that the pt
s dysphagia could be
   contributing to her chest discomfort at night.
   - d/w GI
   - consider further work-up while inpatient versus as an outpatient
   .
   # NSTEMI: Troponin peaked at 0.26. Cath shows 3-vessel disease. Poor
   candidate for PCI given 3VD and history of GI bleeding. Patient does
   not want CABG.
   - ASA (decreased dose as above)
   - no Plavix given guaiac positive stools
   - continue statin, metoprolol, Imdur
   - holding ACE for now; will consider adding if BP not control
   .
   # Acute on chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure: Echo shows new
   focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of ischemic
   etiology. Endocarditis less likely given blood cultures negative to
   date. Patient does not want valve surgery.
   - BP control with beta blocker, amlodipine, and Imdur
   - supplemental O2
   - diurese with IV Lasix (goal negative 1-2 L)
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine reportedly at baseline.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine

   # Polymyalgia rheumatica:
   -continue prednisone at home dose

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and a recent hospital transfer for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation. She has also been experiencing chest pain, hypoxemia, decreased hematocrit, dysphagia, and an acute-on-chronic NSTEMI.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 71 bpm (with a normal sinus rhythm), blood pressure ranging from 135/49 mmHg to 145/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a weight of 70 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 13.7 to 21.0 thousand cells/mm³, hemoglobin level ranging from 24.9 to 30.0 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 198 to 329 cells/mm³, creatinine level ranging from 1.4 to 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 102 to 199 mg/dL, troponin T levels peaking at 0.26 ng/mL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia (30 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (3.7 mEq/L), and hypocalcemia (8.5 mg/dL).

The patient has been prescribed various medications including metoprolol, imdur, diuretics, antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and blood transfusion due to decreased hematocrit. She has also been advised to follow up with a gastrointestinal consult for dysphagia and potential GI bleeding.

The patient's medical complications include acute-on-chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure, chronic kidney disease, dysphagia, decreased hematocrit likely due to GI bleeding, and an acute-on-chronic NSTEMI. The patient does not want coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for her coronary artery disease.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her cardiac condition, electrolyte imbalances, renal function, and potential GI bleeding. She should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening heart failure, respiratory distress, bleeding, or other complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo F with HTN, dCHF, CKD, h/o guaiac-positive stools, transferred
   from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**] for cardiac catheterization in the setting of elevated
   cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) **] to have 3-vessel disease.
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient has recurrent chest pain that is not completely
   responsive to NTG. Etiology unclear: cardiac vs. related to pt
s PNA
   vs. related to dysphagia. Also likely some anxiety component. Of note,
   pt was started on long-acting nitrate yesterday in an effort to better
   control her pain. Also, increased metprolol overnight.
   - continue metoprolol
   - increase imdur to 90 mg daily; consider giving dose at bedtime
   because pt seems to develop her chest discomfort at night
   - continue PRN ntg
   - consider further GI evaluation for potential dysphagia (see below)
   .
   # Hypoxemia: Pt will on NC and intermittently requiring NRB. Her
   hypoxemia likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation (4+ on
   recent echo) and pneumonia (CXR shows multifocal pneumonia).
   - f/u pending blood cultures and send second set prior to antibiotics
   - continue antibiotics for HAP: vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin (day
   1 = [**2161-2-18**])
   - treat heart failure/mitral regurgitation with diruesis and BP control
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Decreased Hematocrit: The patient had a 5 point drop in her
   hematocrit overnight. The most likely etiology for this is GI bleeding,
   in this patient with a history of guaiac positive stools (including a
   large guaiac positive stool yesterday).
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs now, f/u Hct after
   - crossmatched for 2 additional units
   - d/w pt her goals of care; consider GI consult
   - decreased heparin SQ and ASA doses
   - send additional stool sample for c.diff, considering patient
s recent
   diarrhea
   .
   # Dysphagia: Yesterday evening, pt reported episodes of food
getting
   stuck
 in her throat and subsequent emesis of partially digested food.
   She states that she has never mentioned this to her doctors in the
   past. Of note, there is some thought that the pt
s dysphagia could be
   contributing to her chest discomfort at night.
   - d/w GI
   - consider further work-up while inpatient versus as an outpatient
   .
   # NSTEMI: Troponin peaked at 0.26. Cath shows 3-vessel disease. Poor
   candidate for PCI given 3VD and history of GI bleeding. Patient does
   not want CABG.
   - ASA (decreased dose as above)
   - no Plavix given guaiac positive stools
   - continue statin, metoprolol, Imdur
   - holding ACE for now; will consider adding if BP not control
   .
   # Acute on chronic mitral regurgitation/heart failure: Echo shows new
   focal wall motion abnormalities and worsened MR, likely of ischemic
   etiology. Endocarditis less likely given blood cultures negative to
   date. Patient does not want valve surgery.
   - BP control with beta blocker, amlodipine, and Imdur
   - supplemental O2
   - diurese with IV Lasix (goal negative 1-2 L)
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine reportedly at baseline.
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Polymyalgia rheumatica:
   -continue prednisone at home dose
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression:
   -continue nortriptaline and Zyprexa at home dose

   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization due to elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion abnormalities, and worsened mitral regurgitation.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention:

1. Chest pain: The patient experiences recurrent chest pain that is not completely responsive to nitroglycerin. The etiology is unclear, with possible causes including cardiac issues, pneumonia, or dysphagia. The plan includes continuing metoprolol, increasing imdur to 90 mg daily, using NTG as needed, and considering further GI evaluation for potential dysphagia.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient requires NC and intermittent NRB for oxygen support. Hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, related to mitral regurgitation and pneumonia. The plan includes continuing antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, treating heart failure/mitral regurgitation with diuretics and blood pressure control, and weaning O2 as tolerated.

3. Decreased hematocrit: The patient experienced a 5-point drop in hematocrit overnight, likely due to GI bleeding. The plan includes transfusing 1 unit PRBCs now, following up on Hct, crossmatching for additional units, discussing the patient's goals of care, considering a GI consult, decreasing heparin and ASA"
