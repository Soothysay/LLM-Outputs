   MICU ATTENDING ADMISSION NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 43M germ cell tumor / choriocarcinoma s/p
   periaortic LN dissection by urology / vascular surgery. Admitted for
   postop monitoring in the setting of hypertension / tachycardia as well
   as oxygen monitoring / titration in the setting of bleomycin lung
   toxicity. Regional block by anesthesia / esmolol / morphine PCA /
   boluses with good effect in the setting of pain / hypertension and
   tachycardia.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.5 BP 130/70 HR 83 RR 18 with sat 94 on 1LNC.
   Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2 tachy. Soft, dressing c/d/i, few bowel sounds. No
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 18K, HCT 29, K+ 3.9, Cr 0.7.
   Agree with plan to manage postop pain with APS consult, PCA, morphine
   IV, and toradol; though he c/o pain, he appears comfortable and has no
   HTN / tachycardia this AM. Will monitor HCT postop, maintain BBS, and
   keep NPO x meds. Given bleo lung, will try to keep him on room air,
   tolerate sats in the high 80s, continue NAC as well as advair for
   component of COPD. WBC improving, monitor off abx. PPI for GERD, resume
   home meds. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male admitted to the MICU with hypoxia and pneumonia. The patient has a history of cancer, including germ cell tumor with choriocarcinoma and lymphoma. He underwent a periaortic lymph node biopsy and is now experiencing acute pain, chronic pain, adverse drug event (bleomycin-induced lung injury), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cocaine abuse, and chronic anemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/80 mmHg to 138/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal bilateral mid lung alveolar infiltrates, air under the right hemidiaphragm, ascites, trace right pleural effusion, and an NG tube tip in the stomach. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including ketamine, augmenting, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxia and pneumonia. He was transferred to the MICU due to nursing concerns. The patient has a history of chronic lower back pain, cancer, lymphoma, gastrointestinal bleed, seizure with status epilepticus, and cocaine abuse. He is currently on several medications including augmentin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ketamine, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low oxygen saturation. His blood pressure is within normal range but fluctuating. He has an increased respiratory rate and is on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's neurological assessment is not fully assessed. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count, anemia, and normal platelet count. The patient's imaging shows bilateral mid lung alveolar infiltrates, air under the right hemidiaphragm, ascites, trace right pleural effusion, and NG tube tip in the stomach. Microbiology tests are pending. The patient has multiple medical problems including pain control, adverse drug event, cancer, GERD, cocaine abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anemia, and lymphoma."

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of emphysema, bleomycin-induced lung toxicity, germ cell tumor with choriocarcinoma post retroperitoneal LN biopsy, transferred to the MICU with hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia versus health care-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient has underlying lung disease, including emphysema and bleomycin-induced lung toxicity. He experienced an episode of desaturation to the 80s yesterday associated with shortness of breath that improved with albuterol. Currently, he denies any shortness of breath, and oxygen saturations are at goal 90% on 1 L. Hypoxia is likely multifactorial, related to aspiration versus pneumonia (HAP) with new bilateral infiltrates in the setting of known underlying lung disease. 

The patient also has ileus, which is improving after flatus and bowel movement. He is on narcotics and has had large abdominal surgery, which may contribute to the ileus. 

Leukocytosis is likely secondary to pneumonia as above and post-operative state. 

Sinus tachycardia is noted, which could be related to infection or surgical procedure. 

Anemia is present, likely related to post-operative blood loss. The patient has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. 

Coagulopathy is present with an INR of 1.8, likely related to nutritional deficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of heroin addiction, cocaine abuse, memory impairment, germ cell tumor, and postoperative complications. He is currently in the ICU due to hypoxia caused by aspiration pneumonia and postoperative ileus. The patient has underlying bleomycin-induced lung toxicity. Recent CT angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism, and the patient is now on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with oxygen saturation levels in the low 90s. The patient's white blood cell count is decreasing, and he is afebrile. Sputum cultures show normal flora. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: Aspiration pneumonia, likely secondary to postoperative ileus. The patient has underlying bleomycin toxicity. Recent CTA negative for PE, now on NIPPV with sats in low 90s. WBCs coming down, afebrile. Sputum cxs with normal flora. Continue vancomycin+zosyn (day 1 yesterday as likely had a recurrent aspiration episode), x 8 days, increase vancomycin to 1500 Q12 given low trough. Continue NPO and NGT to suction. Continue Advair, NAC, nebs. Flonase for nasal congestion. Goal sats high 80s/low 90s.
2. Pain control: Now reasonably controlled on ketamine IV and dilaudid PCA. Continue ketamine gtt and dilaudid PCA. Follow-up Pain team recs.
3. Ileus: [**2-28**] abdominal surgery and narcotics for pain control. + Flatus today, and + BMs. Continue NGT to suction. OOB, mobilize. Follow general surgery recs. Repeat KUB prn change in clinical status.
4. Sinus tachycardia: Per urology, normal post-operatively secondary to dissection of sympathetic trunk during procedure. Likely also related to pneumonia and pain. Remains afebrile. ECG with ST. Monitor.
5. Anemia: HCT slowly drifting down, 25 from 31 on admission, likely related to post-op blood loss, s/p 4 units PRBCs. Daily HCTs. PPI IV BID. Guaiac all stool. Transfuse HCT<21 or active bleed.
6. Coagulopathy: Elevated INR, likely [**2-28**] nutritional deficiency since admission. Vitamin K again today to bring down in order to allow Pain team to place epidural for pain control.
7. Choriocarcinoma: S/p RPLND: plan per urology, outpatient oncology ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1035**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9334**]). Follow up biopsy results. Appreciate urology recs.
8. Seizure disorder: No reported seizures in hospital. Continue zonegran.

ICU Care:
Nutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) due to ileus. The plan is to continue nutrition via other means, such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or enteral nutrition once the ileus resolves.
Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored regularly to ensure they are within the target range.
Lines: The patient has an indwelling port (PortaCath) and a 20-gauge line placed on [**2108-3-10**].
Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin subcutaneously to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
Communication: The patient's code status is full code, and he is stable for transfer to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of heroin abuse, cocaine abuse, memory impairment, germ cell tumor, and previous retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. He presented to the hospital with aspiration pneumonia, likely secondary to post-operative ileus. He also has underlying bleomycin-induced lung toxicity. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and is currently on nasal cannula with oxygen saturation in the low 90s. His white blood cell count is decreasing, and he is afebrile. Sputum cultures have shown normal flora. 

The patient's pain is reasonably controlled with ketamine IV and dilaudid PCA. He has an ileus due to recent abdominal surgery and narcotics for pain control. The ileus is expected to improve with flatus today and bowel movements. 

The patient has sinus tachycardia, which is likely related to post-operative factors, pneumonia, and pain. His hemoglobin concentration is slowly decreasing, likely due to post-operative blood loss, and he received 4 units of packed red blood cells. 

The patient also has coagulopathy, likely secondary to nutritional deficiency. He is being given vitamin K to lower the INR so that an epidural for pain control can be placed. 

Other ongoing issues include choriocarcinoma post RPLND, seizure disorder, and potential complications related to his ICU care, such as glycemic control, lines"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of heroin abuse, memory impairment, germ cell tumor, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. He presented to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia, likely secondary to post-operative ileus and previous bleomycin-induced lung toxicity. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/80 to 138/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 89%. The patient is on various medications, including ketamine infusion and dilaudid PCA for pain management, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential complication related to aspiration pneumonia and underlying lung disease. This may require close monitoring and adjustment of oxygen delivery devices.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially develop into hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) has been initiated.

3. Ileus: The patient has post-operative ileus, likely secondary to narcotics and the post-operative state. This can result in abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cancer, including lymphoma and choriocarcinoma post retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy, who presented to the ICU with hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient has underlying lung disease, including emphysema and bleomycin-induced lung toxicity. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has underlying lung disease and is currently experiencing hypoxia. This could be due to aspiration pneumonia or HAP. Further investigations, such as sputum and blood cultures, are needed. The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotics, bronchodilators, and supplemental oxygen.

2. Ileus: The patient has post-operative ileus since surgery, likely secondary to narcotics and the post-operative state. Measures to minimize narcotic use and appreciate pain recommendations are being implemented. The patient will continue with a ketamine infusion, and fleet enemas will be given as needed. Out-of-bed activities will be limited.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count is likely secondary to pneumonia and the post-operative state. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigations, such as C. difficile testing, urine analysis, and cultures, will be done. Blood cultures have already been obtained.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of emphysema, bleomycin-induced lung toxicity, germ cell tumor with choriocarcinoma, and retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy. The patient was transferred to the ICU with hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and small bowel obstruction (SBO).

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 121 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86% on room air. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.4°C.

The patient has several medical complications and comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer (lymphoma), gastrointestinal bleed, seizure disorder, and cocaine abuse. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.0 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, and coagulopathy with an INR of 1.8. Imaging studies reveal bilateral parenchymal opacities, small effusions, and small amounts of free intraperitoneal air, as well as patchy increased density over both humeral heads suggestive of avascular necrosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of emphysema, bleomycin-induced lung toxicity, germ cell tumor with choriocarcinoma, and previous surgeries. He was transferred to the ICU with hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and small bowel obstruction. The patient has multiple medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, coagulopathy, and a history of seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has underlying lung disease and may experience episodes of desaturation due to aspiration or pneumonia. Close monitoring and oxygen supplementation may be required.
2. Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has new bilateral infiltrates and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected HAP. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of previous surgeries and may have developed adhesions leading to SBO. This can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Appropriate pain management and bowel rest may be needed.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, possibly due to post-operative blood loss and chronic disease. Serial monitoring and blood transfusion may be required.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, likely due to poor oral intake and nutritional deficiency. Vitamin K supplementation and continued monitoring are necessary.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of emphysema, bleomycin-induced lung toxicity, germ cell tumor with choriocarcinoma, post-retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy, and multiple other medical conditions. The patient was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and small bowel obstruction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient has underlying lung disease (emphysema and bleomycin-induced lung toxicity) which puts him at risk for respiratory failure and further episodes of hypoxia. Aspiration pneumonia is already present, and there is a possibility of worsening or development of new lung infections due to his compromised respiratory status.

2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has small bowel obstruction, likely secondary to narcotics and post-operative state. This can lead to further intestinal ischemia, perforation, or worsening of the obstruction.

3. Infection-related complications: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected HAP. There is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance or C. difficile infection due to the use of these antibiotics.

4. Hematologic complications: The patient has leukocytosis likely secondary to pneumonia and post-operative state. Monitoring for progression and appropriate management is important.

5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of emphysema, bleomycin-induced lung toxicity, germ cell tumor with choriocarcinoma, post-operative status, and other comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has been improving but continues to have various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has underlying lung disease, including emphysema and bleomycin-induced lung toxicity, which predisposes him to episodes of desaturation. The hypoxia could be multifactorial, related to aspiration versus pneumonia (HAP) with new bilateral infiltrates in the setting of known underlying lung disease.
2. Ileus: The patient has post-operative ileus since surgery, likely secondary to narcotics and the post-operative state. It is improving after flatus and bowel movement.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis likely secondary to pneumonia as mentioned above and post-operative state. It is necessary to check C. difficile if he has stool and UA and Ucx to be complete.
4. Avascular necrosis: The patient has avascular necrosis with unclear etiology, no recent steroids, bisphosphonates, or trauma. It is important to investigate recent chemotherapy use.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of emphysema, bleomycin-induced lung toxicity, germ cell tumor with choriocarcinoma, post-operative retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy, and recent admission to the ICU with hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient has underlying lung disease and experienced an episode of desaturation to the 80s yesterday associated with shortness of breath, which improved with albuterol. He is currently on supplemental oxygen and showing improvement. The patient also has small bowel obstruction, likely secondary to narcotics and post-operative state, large abdominal surgery. There is evidence of leukocytosis likely secondary to pneumonia and post-operative state. The patient has sinus tachycardia, possibly related to infection or surgical procedure. Anemia is present, likely related to post-operative blood loss. There is a coagulopathy, possibly nutritional in nature due to decreased PO intake. The patient has a history of choriocarcinoma following retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. There are no reported seizures during hospitalization. The patient's condition is pending clinical improvement, and he is currently on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of heroin abuse and resultant memory impairment, who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for germ cell tumor and developed post-operative complications such as ileus and aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has a history of bleomycin-induced lung toxicity and chemo treatment. He presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonia and underlying bleomycin toxicity. Recent CTA ruled out pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently on noninvasive ventilation with sat levels in the low 90s and has decreasing WBC count. Sputum cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: Aspiration pneumonia, likely related to post-operative ileus. Continue vancomycin and Zosyn for 8 days, increase vancomycin to 1500 Q12 due to low trough levels. Continue NPO and NGT to suction. Maintain sat levels in high 80s/low 90s.
2. Pain control: Reasonably controlled on ketamine IV and Dilaudid PCA. Continue ketamine gtt and Dilaudid PCA, follow up with pain team recommendations.
3. Ileus: Continue NGT to suction. Mobilize out of bed, follow general surgery recommendations. Repeat KUB as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including small bowel obstruction, chronic pain, adverse drug event, cancer, GERD, cocaine abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, and a history of lymphoma. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a known issue with small bowel obstruction, which can lead to complications such as abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and bowel ischemia if not managed properly.
2. Adverse drug event (bleomycin-induced lung injury): The patient is at risk for respiratory complications due to previous administration of bleomycin, which can cause lung injury and potentially lead to respiratory distress or failure.
3. Cancer: The patient's history of cancer increases the risk of disease progression, metastasis, and potential complications related to the underlying malignancy.
4. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain management requires careful attention to avoid oversedation or inadequate pain control, which could potentially worsen the patient's overall condition.
5. Cocaine abuse: The patient's history of cocaine abuse may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, particularly during periods of stress or withdrawal.
6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient's COPD may exacerbate during periods"

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of heroin abuse, who presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's condition has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia, likely secondary to post-operative ileus. He also has underlying bleomycin-induced lung toxicity. Recent computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), and the patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with oxygen saturation levels in the low 90s. The white blood cell (WBC) count is coming down, and the patient is afebrile. Sputum cultures have shown normal results.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected recurrent aspiration episode. He is being kept NPO (nothing by mouth) and has a nasogastric tube (NGT) to suction. The patient is also receiving medications such as Advair, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), nebulizers, and Flonase for nasal congestion. The goal oxygen saturation level is set at high 80s to low 90s.

For pain management, the patient is receiving ketamine intravenous (IV) and dilaudid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The pain team recommendations will be followed up on.

The patient is also being treated for ileus, which is likely due to abdominal surgery and the use"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of heroin addiction and memory impairment, who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for germ cell tumor and developed postoperative complications including ileus and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxia caused by the aspiration pneumonia and background COPD. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ketamine IV, dilaudid PCA, Atrovent, Xopenex, gabapentin, MS contin, Advair, MVI, vitamin D, Zonegran, Colace, and fluticasone.

Vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 121 bpm), low oxygen saturation (86%), and stable blood pressure (120/74 mmHg). The patient's temperature is slightly below normal (36.4°C) and respiratory rate is within normal range (36 breaths per minute). Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 2,221 mL total intake, 2,101 mL IV fluids, and 437 mL output.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL and a hematocrit of 32.1%. The patient has elevated white blood cell count (28.0 K/uL) and platelet count (478 K/uL). Other lab results are within normal limits"
