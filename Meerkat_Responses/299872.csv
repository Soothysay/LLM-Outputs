","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a past medical history of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previous pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and diabetes.
- She was admitted with hypoxia and acute respiratory failure, likely due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a resistant organism.
- She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 100/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 50%.
- Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left middle and lower lobes, no wheezing or crackles, and no calf tenderness or edema.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, but normal glucose and electrolyte levels.
- Bronchoscopy findings indicate the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no microorganisms.
- The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with plans to send bilateral bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for gram stain and culture, as well as fungal culture.
- She is also receiving medications for COPD, including inhalers and steroids, and her theophylline level is within normal range.

","The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a past medical history of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous pulmonary embolism. She presents with hypoxia and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with resistant organisms. She has undergone bronchoscopy, which showed thick purulent material, and her bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is pending for gram stain and culture.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 100/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and sedated, but responds to commands by nodding her head and moving all four extremities.

Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 135 mg/dL, potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, and creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Her blood cultures are pending.

The patient's plan includes ongoing mechanical ventilation, broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage for suspected HAP with resistant organisms, and further diagnostic tests such as BAL cultures and a CT scan of the chest. She will also be monitored for complications such as deep vein thrombosis (D"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, awake and alert. The patient has a history of COPD and OSA, which may contribute to the respiratory failure. 

The patient has a pulmonary infiltrate in the left lower lobe (LLL), which is suspected to be due to pneumonia or aspiration. There is concern for resistant microbes, especially Gram-negative bacteria (GNR), so broad-spectrum antimicrobials are recommended.

The patient also has hypovolemia, which is being addressed with net hydration and monitoring of intake and output. Renal insufficiency is noted as baseline, and the patient's urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels will be monitored. 

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and anticoagulation with heparin is being continued to maintain a PTT of 60-80.

Nutritional support is being held temporarily. The patient's hypercalcemia and diabetes mellitus type II (NIDDM) require further evaluation and management.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but there are several medical complications that can arise.

1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has a pulmonary infiltrate in the left lower lobe (LLL), which is suspected to be due to pneumonia or aspiration. There is also concern for resistant microbes, especially gram-negative bacteria (GNR) coverage. Continuous suctioning is planned.

2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient has baseline renal insufficiency and is being monitored with urine output (uo), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels. Renal dose medications are being administered.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia, which is possibly related to pneumonia. Monitoring of sodium levels is planned, and normal saline (NS) will be provided.

4. Fluid Management: The patient has hypovolemia, and net hydration is being planned. Intake and output (I/O) will be closely monitored.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with a significant medical history of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), and pneumonia (PNA). She presented with hypoxia and was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and recent CAP treatment. The patient also has hypercarbia, likely secondary to COPD.

The patient's current condition is stable, as indicated by passing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and demonstrating a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 21, which suggests she can tolerate extubation. However, she has developed a cuff leak overnight, which may indicate a risk of post-extubation stridor.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting an ongoing infection. Her blood cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are positive only for parainfluenza, so she will be covered with vancomycin (Vanco) and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). If she worsens, broader coverage for anaerobic and/or double pseudomonal coverage may be considered.

The patient's other medical conditions include chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypercalcemia, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a history of PE. She is currently on home oxygen and bipap for COPD management. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previous pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. She was admitted with hypoxia and is currently in the ICU. The patient's recent course includes treatment for community-acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin and a subsequent hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime. Her chest X-ray and CT scan show left lower lobe collapse with collapse of the left mainstem bronchus, indicating a likely hospital-acquired pneumonia with a resistant organism. Other possible etiologies include fungal infection, abscess, or infarct from a pulmonary embolism. The patient passed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and has a cuff leak, which suggests impending extubation. The cultures/swabs/bal positive only for parainfluenza virus, so she will be covered with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. If her condition worsens, broad-spectrum coverage for anaerobic and/or double pseudomonal coverage may be considered. The patient continues to receive steroids for chronicity and inhalers for COPD management. Her INR is now therapeutic, so she can discontinue IV heparin and continue with home dose of warfarin.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including new/recurrent
   pneumonia, LLL atalectasis, severe tracheobronchomalacia, underlying
   COPD and OSA.  Plan extubation trial this AM, maintain COPD medication
   regimen (including steroids), and antimicrobials.  Plan to use
   non-invasive ventilation prn.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, suspect pneumonia, suspect aspiration.
   +Parainfluenza by viral rapid pane.  Concern for superimposed resistent
   bacterial microbes (recent prolonged antimicrobials and intubation) -->
   would favor broad spectrum antimicrobials, esp. GNR coverage.  Continue
   suctioning.
   HYPONATREMIA -- Euvolemic.  Possibly related to pneumonia.  Plan
   monitor Na+, provide NS.
   RENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- baseline.  Monitor uo, BUN,creatinine.  Renal
   dose medications.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemia; plan maintain fliud balance.  Monitor I/O.
   h/o PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- continue anticoagulation, use heparin,
   maintain PTT 60-80
 d/c  and resume Coumadin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT --  Encourage PO if remains extubated.
   HYPERCALCEMIA

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday but did not show any cuff leak, so extubation was postponed. However, the patient had a favorable RSBI (respiratory system compliance and frequency of spontaneous breaths) this morning and an excellent SBT with an audible cuff leak. 

The patient's allergies include linezolid, which can cause hives and rash. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl infusions for sedation. Pantoprazole (Protonix) was given to prevent stress ulcers. Dextrose 50% was administered to maintain blood glucose levels.

The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for dry mouth and the presence of an orogastric (OG) tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C (98.9Â°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/70 to 123/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, overweight status, and no signs of edema or cyanosis. The patient's cardiovascular"

The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a set tidal volume of 0 mL and spontaneous tidal volume of 608-788 mL. The respiratory support parameters, including positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and respiratory system compliance (RSBI), are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, and normal cardiovascular and peripheral vascular assessments. There are no signs of respiratory distress or abnormal breath sounds. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with soft"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with a significant medical history including COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia (PNA), and hyperthyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, which is attributed to her underlying COPD and a recent case of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient also had an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a history of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/54 mmHg to 148/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support.

Her physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for decreased breath sounds in the left middle and lower lobes. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics including linezolid, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin. She is also receiving heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previous pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and hyperthyroidism. She presents with hypoxia and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure due to suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia with a resistant organism. She has undergone bronchoscopy, which showed thick purulent material and cultures positive for parainfluenza virus. The patient has been placed on invasive ventilation and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 1% and PEEP at 0 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Barotrauma: The high pressure within the alveoli due to mechanical ventilation can cause lung injury and potentially lead to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Excessive tidal volumes or plateau pressures during ventilation can result in lung injury and worsen respiratory function.
4. Infectious complications: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and recent hospitalization, there is a risk of additional infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or"

   Assessment and Plan
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION:
 PNEUMONIA:  Positive for parainfluenze, cultures otherwise negative.
   Continues vancomycin, MDIs, prednisone taper.  On vanco/zosyn.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Coumadin stopped yesterday and IV heparin
   started given anticipated procedure (stent for TBM).
 TBM:  Seen by IP, anticipate stent placement next week.
 HYPONATREMIA:  Now may be related to diuresis and contraction,
   holding lasix as below.  Follow serial labs. [**Month (only) 8**] also be component of
   SIADH given lung process.
 HYPERCALCEMIA:  PTH was 62.  Plan for malignancy workup.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to component of
   dehydration.  Lytes suggest prerenal.  Hold lasix and follow.
 DM:  Continue current management

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 106-year-old female with a chief complaint of acute on chronic respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently extubated, tolerating oatmeal for breakfast, and producing yellow secretions while coughing. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, with an acute exacerbation of pneumonia caused by parainfluenza. The patient is receiving vancomycin, MDIs, and prednisone taper, as well as vancomycin/Zosyn.

The patient also has pulmonary embolism, for which Coumadin was stopped and IV heparin started due to an anticipated procedure for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TBM). The patient is scheduled to undergo stent placement next week. Additionally, the patient has hypontremia related to diuresis and contraction, hypercalcemia, and acute on chronic renal failure secondary to dehydration. The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with current medication.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and various lines including a PICC line and a 20-gauge line. Prophylaxis measures include systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP)"
