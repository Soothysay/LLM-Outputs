   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis,
   presenting with 3 days of UTI (with + urine culture) and worsening
   productive cough/hypoxia likely representing PNA.
   .
   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR s/p fluid
   resuscitation in the ED is notable for bilateral infiltrates but with
   some focality in the LUL and RML. Hx of worsening productive cough and
   progression of hypoxia at home are suspicious for PNA. Most recent
   sputum  grew pan-senitive Kleb and MRSA. Pt received vanco/zosyn in the
   ED and is now on vanco/meropenem/gent (for reasons related to UTI and
   prior Cxs).  Respiratory failure was both hypoxic (corrected with NRB
   in ED) and hypercapneic--etiology of hypercapnea may have been
   retainment [**3-6**] supplemental O2 and obtundation from sepsis/PNA/UTI.
   - f/u Blood Cx, sputum Cx, urine legionella, flu swab (droplet
   precaution in interim)
   - Covering for HAP given recent hospitalization and trach with vanco,
   meropenem, gentamicin (reasons below). d1= [**12-18**]
   - tamiflu 75mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - No plans to wean vent overnight as still requiring fluid
   resuscitation for sepsis
   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - consider ECHO in AM
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension: Weaned off levophed as a-line pressures higher
   than non-invasives. S/p 7L NS in the ED with CVP~10 on arrival. Good
   UOP at this time.  Attributable to either pulmonary or urinary
   infection--at this time, seems to have both. Highly concerning that her
   WBC dropped from 6 to 3 in a span of 4 hours and bandemia rose from 1%
   to 33%.
   - bolus to maintain MAP>60, HR~80, UOP>60
   - resume levophed if fails to be fluid responsive
   - serial lactate
   - consider Abd US in AM to assess fro ascites as reported on prior
   supine CXR, if present, tap
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4 which is the upper limit of
   what is considered to be sensitive. This was discussed w/ ID; their
   recommendation was to add gentamicin to meropenem given the severity of
   her presentation and borderline sensitivity to carbapenems.
   - vancomycin, meropenem, gentamicin
   - gentamicin troughs daily, monitor renal fxn daily, minimize other
   nephtotoxins
   - consider formal ID c/s in AM
   .
   # S/p traumatic spine injury: continue home methadone, baclofen,
   lyrica; hold oxycodone, oxybutynin and klonopin
   # Hypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine
   # Hepatitis C: negative VL recently
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with symptoms consistent with a UTI and worsening productive cough/hypoxia, suggesting pneumonia. The patient was treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and gentamicin due to the severity of her presentation and the resistance patterns of the identified pathogens.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and bands, indicating an inflammatory response. Her blood cultures grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella and MRSA. She has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggestive of pneumonia. The sputum culture grew pan-sensitive Kleb and MRSA. The patient's respiratory failure was both hypoxic and hypercapneic, which may be due to retention of supplemental oxygen and obtundation from sepsis/PNA/UTI.

The patient's medical history includes paraplegia, hypothyroidism, hepatitis C, and a traumatic spine injury. She is currently receiving various medications, including methadone, baclofen, lyrica, levothyroxine, PPI/sucralfate, heparin, and an IVC filter.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure, characterized by hypoxia and hypercapnia, indicates a need for close monitoring and management of her ventilation support.

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis,
   presenting with 3 days of UTI (with + urine culture) and worsening
   productive cough/hypoxia likely representing PNA.
   .
   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR this AM notable
   for worsened fluid overload, no focal consolidation evident, but
   opacities predominantly in the lower lobes.  Switched from AC to PSV
   this AM for comfort with no intention to wean vent today as primary
   infectious process not yet controlled and may require addntl fluid
   resuscitation for sepsis despite pulm edema..
   - f/u Blood Cx, sputum Cx, urine legionella (NEGATIVE), flu swab (DFA
   NEGATIVE, viral culture pending)
   - Covering for HAP given recent hospitalization and trach with vanco,
   meropenem, gentamicin (reasons below). d1= [**12-18**]
   - continue tamiflu 75mg [**Hospital1 **] until viral culture final
   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - consider ECHO when off pressors and s/p some duiresis as cardiomegaly
   worse on CXR, pt s/p recent PEA arrest in [**2147-10-3**] (last echo in
   system [**2146**] normal)
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension: S/p 7L NS in the ED and 1-2 L here with CVP~14.
   Good UOP at this time.  Attributable to either pulmonary or urinary
   infection--at this time, seems to have both. Highly concerning that her
   initial WBC dropped from 6 to 3 in a span of 4 hours and bandemia rose
   from 1% to 33%.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60
   - serial lactate, SVO2 (last sample =94, spurious)
   - Abd US in TODAY to assess fro ascites as reported on prior supine
   CXR, if present, tap
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4 which is the upper limit of
   what is considered to be sensitive. This was discussed w/ ID; their
   recommendation was to add gentamicin to meropenem given the severity of
   her presentation and borderline sensitivity to carbapenems.
   - vancomycin, meropenem, gentamicin D1=[**12-18**]
   - gentamicin troughs daily, monitor renal fxn daily, minimize other
   nephtotoxins
   - consider formal ID if pt fails to improve
   .
   # S/p traumatic spine injury: continue home methadone, baclofen,
   lyrica; hold oxycodone, oxybutynin and klonopin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of a UTI, worsening productive cough, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate hypercapnia, which suggests respiratory acidosis. The chest X-ray shows fluid overload and opacities predominantly in the lower lobes, but no focal consolidation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and a decrease in hemoglobin levels. Blood cultures have been taken, and antibiotics have been started empirically to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including vancomycin, meropenem, and gentamicin. Additional coverage for Legionella and influenza has been added due to the patient's symptoms and recent hospitalization.

The patient's medical history includes paraplegia, hypothyroidism, hepatitis C, and traumatic spine injury. She is currently on home medications for pain management, including methadone, baclofen, and lyrica. She also has a history of esophageal ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo paraplegic female (T2 injury following MVC [**1-5**]) who has a
   history of recurrent UTIs and pneumonias who presents with SOB/cough x
   a few days and UTI symptoms.  Found to be in respiratory failure
   (intubated) and hypotensive (on pressors), likely sepsis from a
   pulmonary vs urinary source.
   # Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely [**3-6**] PNA vs ARDS from
   sepsis. [**Month (only) 8**] be a component of CHF given volume resuscitation and large
   heart.
   - F/U sputum culture, flu culture
   - Droplet precautions
   - On tamiflu until final culture reported
   - Abx as below
   - Switch to PS. Will need diuresis once BP stable to help with chest
   wall dynamics
   # Sepsis: Possible sources include UTI  vs PNA
   - Check SvO2
   - Volume resuscitation as necessary to maintain CVP > 10.  Levophed for
   MAP >60, UOP > 60/hr
   - F/U blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Gent to cover previous evidence ESBL Klebsiella in urine
   and Klebsiella in sputum
   - Abd U/S to evaluate for ascites given history of HCV (most recent VL
   negative)
 may need para to r/o SBP
   # CHF: Evidence of CM and pulm edema on CXR.  No TTE since after
   cardiac arrest on last admission
   - Hold off on more IVF as CVP 14 this am
   - Diurese once off pressors
   - TTE once acute issues resolved
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   - On home meds: baclofen, methadone and lyrica
   # Hypothroidism: On synthroid
   # Depression:

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia/hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The assessment and plan indicate the following:

1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has pneumonia versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis. She will need close follow-up on sputum culture, flu culture, and administration of antiviral medication (Tamiflu) until final culture reported. She will also be on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover previous evidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella in urine and sputum.

2. Sepsis: Possible sources include UTI versus PNA. The patient should be monitored for mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and volume resuscitation as necessary to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) > 10. Levophed may be used for mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, and urine output (UOP) > 60/hr. Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be necessary.

3. CHF: There is evidence of cardiomegaly (CM) and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended once acute issues are resolved.

4. T2 Paraplegia: The patient is on home medications including baclofen, methadone, and lyrica.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on Synthroid.

6. Depression: The patient's home medication of citalopram (Celexa) has been held.

ICU care includes nutrition support (NPO), glycemic control, and various lines and catheters for monitoring and treatment. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention measures such as head of bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, further deterioration of heart function leading to cardiogenic shock, and potential development of pressure ulcers or other complications related to immobility."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonias, who presents with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) and cough for a few days, as well as UTI symptoms. She is currently in respiratory failure and hypotensive, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient may have sepsis caused by either a urinary tract infection or pneumonia. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Drug Allergies: There are no known drug allergies mentioned in the progress note.
4. Paraplegia: The patient has T2 paraplegia due to a motor vehicle collision, which may affect her mobility and increase the risk of pressure ulcers and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
5. Depression: The patient is taking medication for depression, but it has been held in the ICU. Depression can increase the risk of poor outcomes in critically ill patients.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary for accurate assessment and treatment."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent UTIs and pneumonias. She presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. The patient is currently in respiratory failure (intubated) and hypotensive (on pressors), likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs. This can be caused by pneumonia (PNA) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and presence of fever suggest sepsis. Possible sources of infection include urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia (PNA). Close monitoring of blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures is necessary to identify the causative organism.

3. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The worsening bilateral lower lung field infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray indicate a possible diagnosis of CAP. Appropriate antibiotics should be initiated based on the sensitivity pattern of the organism causing the infection.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated serum creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which can be a complication of sepsis. Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid and medication administration accordingly"

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis,
   presenting with 3 days of UTI (with + urine culture) and worsening
   productive cough/hypoxia likely representing PNA.
   .
   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR this AM notable
   for FURTHER worsening of fluid overload, no focal consolidation
   evident, but opacities predominantly in the lower lobes c/w PNA.
   Switched from PSV to MMV this AM [**3-6**] apnea s/p sedation bolus.
   - f/u Blood Cx (NGTD), sputum Cx (3+ GPC), urine legionella (NEGATIVE),
   flu swab (DFA NEGATIVE, viral culture pending)
   - Covering for HAP given recent hospitalization and trach with vanco,
   meropenem, gentamicin (reasons below). d1= [**12-18**]
   - continue tamiflu 75mg [**Hospital1 **] until viral culture final
   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - had considered deferring ECHO until septic physiology resolved, but
   given degree of fluid overload in lungs, will get it today
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension: S/p 7L NS in the ED and 4 L (total) here with
   CVP~14. Good UOP at this time.  Attributable to either pulmonary or
   urinary infection--seems to have both.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60; currently favoring levophed over fluids
   given CVP~15
   - serial lactate, LAST 1.2
   - Abd US with no ascites to tap
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4 which is the upper limit of
   what is considered to be sensitive. This was discussed w/ ID; their
   recommendation was to add gentamicin to meropenem given the severity of
   her presentation and borderline sensitivity to carbapenems.
   - vancomycin, meropenem, gentamicin D1=[**12-18**]
   - gentamicin troughs daily (goal is trough less than 2 given
   indication), monitor renal fxn daily, minimize other nephtotoxins
   - consider formal ID if pt fails to improve
   - f/u Ucx (GNRs, speciation & sensitivities pending)

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis,
   presenting with 3 days of UTI (with + urine culture) and worsening
   productive cough/hypoxia likely representing PNA.
   .
   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR this AM notable
   for worsened fluid overload, no focal consolidation evident, but
   opacities predominantly in the lower lobes.  Switched from AC to PSV
   this AM for comfort with no intention to wean vent today as primary
   infectious process not yet controlled and may require addntl fluid
   resuscitation for sepsis despite pulm edema..
   - f/u Blood Cx, sputum Cx, urine legionella (NEGATIVE), flu swab (DFA
   NEGATIVE, viral culture pending)
   - Covering for HAP given recent hospitalization and trach with vanco,
   meropenem, gentamicin (reasons below). d1= [**12-18**]
   - continue tamiflu 75mg [**Hospital1 **] until viral culture final
   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - consider ECHO when off pressors and s/p some duiresis as cardiomegaly
   worse on CXR, pt s/p recent PEA arrest in [**2147-10-3**] (last echo in
   system [**2146**] normal)
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension: S/p 7L NS in the ED and 1-2 L here with CVP~14.
   Good UOP at this time.  Attributable to either pulmonary or urinary
   infection--at this time, seems to have both. Highly concerning that her
   initial WBC dropped from 6 to 3 in a span of 4 hours and bandemia rose
   from 1% to 33%.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60
   - serial lactate, SVO2 (last sample =94, spurious)
   - Abd US in TODAY to assess fro ascites as reported on prior supine
   CXR, if present, tap
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4 which is the upper limit of
   what is considered to be sensitive. This was discussed w/ ID; their
   recommendation was to add gentamicin to meropenem given the severity of
   her presentation and borderline sensitivity to carbapenems.
   - vancomycin, meropenem, gentamicin D1=[**12-18**]
   - gentamicin troughs daily, monitor renal fxn daily, minimize other
   nephtotoxins
   - consider formal ID if pt fails to improve
   .
   # S/p traumatic spine injury: continue home methadone, baclofen,
   lyrica; hold oxycodone, oxybutynin and klonopin
   # Hypothyroidism: continue home levothyroxine

","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with symptoms of a UTI and worsening productive cough/hypoxia, likely representing pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2 at 87%) and high respiratory rate (RR at 21 breaths/min) indicate respiratory distress. The chest X-ray shows fluid overload and opacities in the lower lobes, suggesting pulmonary edema. This could lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potentially require mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a high fever, elevated white blood cell count (WBC at 12.6 K/uL), and bandemia (bands at 33.0%). These findings suggest a systemic inflammatory response, which is consistent with sepsis. The source of infection appears to be both pulmonary and urinary, as evidenced by positive urine culture and worsening productive cough/hypoxia.

3. UTI: The patient's history of recurrent UTIs and the positive urine culture indicate an ongoing urinary tract infection. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the infection and prevent complications such as renal involvement or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The 24-hour events indicate a fever with a temperature of 102.2 F, sputum gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and an increase in central venous pressure (CVP) requiring increased levophed infusion. An abdominal ultrasound revealed trace perihepatic ascites.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various antibiotics since admission, including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, tamiflu, vancomycin, gentamicin, and meropenem.

The infusions include fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and other medications. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The vital signs show a maximum temperature of 102.2 F, current temperature of 100.2 F, heart rate (HR) between 78-106 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 133/54 mmHg to 151/133 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 11-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 87%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The fluid balance shows an input of 2,510 mL and output of 1,770 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 740 mL. The respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 550 mL, positive"

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent UTIs and pneumonias. She presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and urinary tract infection. The patient was found in respiratory failure and hypotension, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis, which may contribute to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's condition suggests possible sources of infection including urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia (PNA).
3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): There is evidence of congestive heart failure, as indicated by pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray and the presence of a large heart on examination.
4. Klebsiella infection: Previous evidence of ESBL Klebsiella in urine and sputum suggests the need for appropriate antibiotic coverage.
5. Depression: The patient's home medication includes citalopram (celexa), which is being held in the ICU.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed by the healthcare team to ensure the patient's well-being and appropriate treatment."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia, recurrent UTIs, and pneumonias. She presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. The patient is in respiratory failure, hypotensive, and likely septic from a pulmonary or urinary source. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a possibility of developing further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis.

2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis with possible sources including urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. If not promptly treated, it can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and even death.

3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient shows evidence of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. It is important to closely monitor fluid balance and adjust diuretic therapy to prevent worsening of CHF.

4. Central venous catheter-related infections: The patient has multiple central venous catheters in place, which increases the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility due to paraplegia increases the risk of developing DVT"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonias. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath and a UTI, which led to her being intubated due to respiratory failure and placed on pressors for hypotension. The patient is likely suffering from sepsis, possibly originating from either a pulmonary or urinary source. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia/hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF) given the volume resuscitation and large heart seen on imaging. 

The plan of care includes monitoring and treating for potential infections, including sputum, urine, and influenza cultures. Droplet precautions should be maintained, and antiviral treatment with tamiflu should continue until final flu culture results are reported. Antibiotics have been initiated to cover previous evidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella in both urine and sputum. 

Other ongoing management includes maintaining CVP > 10 with volume resuscitation as necessary and using levophed for MAP > 60 and UOP > 60/hr. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be performed today due to pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. 

In terms of long-term care, the patient"

   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR this AM notable

   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - had considered deferring ECHO until septic physiology resolved, but
   given degree of fluid overload in lungs, will get it today
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension: S/p 7L NS in the ED and 4 L (total) here with
   CVP~14. Good UOP at this time.  Attributable to either pulmonary or
   urinary infection--seems to have both.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60; currently favoring levophed over fluids
   given CVP~15
   - serial lactate, LAST 1.2
   - Abd US with no ascites to tap
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4 which is the upper limit of
   what is considered to be sensitive. This was discussed w/ ID; their
   recommendation was to add gentamicin to meropenem given the severity of
   her presentation and borderline sensitivity to carbapenems.
   - vancomycin, meropenem, gentamicin D1=[**12-18**]
   - gentamicin troughs daily (goal is trough less than 2 given
   indication), monitor renal fxn daily, minimize other nephtotoxins
   - consider formal ID if pt fails to improve

   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR this AM
   slightly better, no focal consolidation evident, but opacities
   predominantly in the lower lobes c/w PNA.  Switched to AC as now on
   propofol and completely sedated.
   - f/u Blood Cx (NGTD), sputum Cx (MRSA), urine legionella (NEGATIVE),

   - Covering for HAP given recent hospitalization and trach with vanco &
   meropenem, gentamicin stopped (reasons below). d1= [**12-18**], plan for week
   long course
   - also seem to have strep in sputum, f/u sensitivities
   - discontinue tamiflu as viral culture final
   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - ECHO fairly unremarkable
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension: S/p 7L NS in the ED and 4 L (total) here with
   CVP~14. Good UOP at this time.  Attributable to either pulmonary or
   urinary infection--seems to have both.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60; currently favoring levophed over fluids
   given CVP~15
   - serial lactate, LAST 1.2
   - Abd US with no ascites to tap
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4. Here, UCX grew citrobacter
   and it does seem to be sensitive to meropenem.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a UTI and worsening productive cough/hypoxia, likely representing pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is acute but not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has impaired skin integrity and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, and there is a current indication of a UTI.
3. Pneumonia: The patient likely has pneumonia, as evidenced by her worsening productive cough/hypoxia and findings on the chest X-ray.
4. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient has acute respiratory failure, but it is not associated with ARDS.
5. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which is likely due to either a pulmonary or urinary infection.
6. Hypotension: The patient's sepsis has led to hypotension, requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
7. Hepatitis C: The patient has hepatitis C, although her viral load is negative.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonias. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. The patient is currently in respiratory failure and hypotensive, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 114/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 17 mmHg and fluid balance with an input of 1,391 mL and output of 2,455 mL since midnight.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including norepinephrine, propofol, heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam, carafate, and various antibiotics such as cefipime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem, and vancomycin.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26.9 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, and hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 2.8 g/dL. The imaging shows improving bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The microbiology results indicate positive cultures for staphylococcus aureus in the sputum and Citrobacter freundii in the urine, which is sensitive to meropenem.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely pneumonia versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis. The patient may also have congestive heart failure (CHF) given volume resuscitation and large heart size.
   - Follow-up sputum culture, urine culture, and flu culture.
   - Droplet precautions.
   - Continue tamiflu until final flu culture reported.
   - Antibiotics as below.
   - Increase PEEP to 8, decrease FiO2 as tolerated.
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

2. Sepsis: Possible sources include urinary tract infection (UTI) versus pneumonia.
   - Volume resuscitation as necessary to maintain CVP > 10. Levophed for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, urine output (UOP) > 60/hr.
   - Follow-up blood/urine/sputum cultures.
   - Vancomycin (Vanc) at a dose of [Last Name (un)]"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonias. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. The patient was found to be in respiratory failure and hypotensive, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxia/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating a severe respiratory failure. This condition can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination.

2. Pneumonia (PNA) vs Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has evidence of volume overload and improving bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which suggests the possibility of pneumonia or ARDS.

3. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, possibly from a urinary tract infection (UTI) or pneumonia (PNA). This condition can progress to septic shock if not promptly treated.

4. UTI: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, and the current presentation includes UTI symptoms. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance.

5. Hct drop: The patient's hematocrit levels have been decreasing, likely due to fluid mobilization. Regular monitoring of hemodynamics"

   Total time spent: 20 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonias, presenting with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB), cough, and UTI symptoms. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, and is also experiencing hypotension requiring the use of vasoactive medications. The patient's condition is likely sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. This can result in decreased oxygen levels in the blood and increased carbon dioxide levels.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough and SOB could indicate pneumonia, which can progress and become more severe if not properly treated.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of recurrent UTIs and the current septic state may lead to decreased renal perfusion and subsequent kidney injury.

4. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and need for vasopressors suggest the possibility of septic shock, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.

5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory status and adherence to proper ventilator care practices are crucial.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonias. She presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. The patient is in respiratory failure and hypotensive, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of volume overload, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has possible sources of infection including UTI and pneumonia. If not appropriately managed, sepsis can progress and lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers.
6. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The presence of central venous catheters increases the risk of CRBSI.
7. Autonomic dysreflexia: This is a condition that can occur in patients with spinal cord injury above T6, characterized by sudden and severe"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have multiple medical conditions, including impaired skin integrity, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and more. The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can lead to blood clot formation in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can cause stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers should be used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The presence of an arterial line and central venous catheter increases the risk of CRBSI. Regular monitoring of blood cultures and adherence to strict sterile techniques during catheter insertion and maintenance are essential.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from medical devices can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate skin care are important preventive measures.
6. Delirium: ICU stay and sedative"

   51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis,
   presenting with CITROBACTER FREUNDII UTI and MRSA PNA.
   .
   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR this AM
   slightly better, no focal consolidation evident, but opacities
   predominantly in the lower lobes c/w PNA.  On AC as now on propofol and
   completely sedated.
   - f/u Blood Cx (NGTD), sputum Cx (MRSA, strep speciation pending),
   urine legionella (NEGATIVE), flu swab (DFA NEGATIVE, viral culture
   negative)
   - Covering for HAP given recent hospitalization and trach with vanco &
   meropenem, gentamicin stopped (reasons below). d1= [**12-18**], plan for week
   long course
   - also seem to have strep in sputum, f/u sensitivities
   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - Wean sedation and attempt PSV as apnea resolves.
   .
   # Hypotension: S/p 7L NS in the ED and 4 L (total) here with CVP~14.
   Good UOP; PT is auto-diuresisng.  Initially hypotension was clearly
   septic in orign, at this point, seems primarily related to propofol and
   requiring the minimal dose of levophed.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60; currently favoring levophed over fluids
   given CVP~15
   - serial lactate, LAST 1.2, no need to trend further unless
   decompensates
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4. Here, UCX grew citrobacter
   and it does seem to be sensitive to meropenem.
   - d/c
ed gentamicin
   - continue meropenem for 14 day course for UTI
   # ANEMIA: Etiology unclear, Likely related to fluid shifts. Serial
   guiaic negative. Initail hapto negative, will repeat. Transfuse one
   unit to reach goal of 25.
   .
   # S/p traumatic spine injury: continue home methadone, baclofen,

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute sepsis without organ dysfunction, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infections and can lead to complications such as cellulitis or wound infections.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can progress to severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not treated promptly and effectively. This may require mechanical ventilation support.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient is experiencing hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function if not managed properly. This may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which can progress to septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively. This can result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to fluid shifts or blood loss. If left untreated, it can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and further complications.
6. UTI/ESBL: The patient has a history of ESBL-producing bacteria"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis,
   presenting with 3 days of UTI (with + urine culture) and worsening
   productive cough/hypoxia likely representing PNA.
   .
   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR this AM
   slightly better, no focal consolidation evident, but opacities
   predominantly in the lower lobes c/w PNA.  Switched to AC as now on
   propofol and completely sedated.
   - f/u Blood Cx (NGTD), sputum Cx (MRSA), urine legionella (NEGATIVE),
   flu swab (DFA NEGATIVE, viral culture pending)
   - Covering for HAP given recent hospitalization and trach with vanco &
   meropenem, gentamicin stopped (reasons below). d1= [**12-18**], plan for week
   long course
   - also seem to have strep in sputum, f/u sensitivities
   - discontinue tamiflu as viral culture final
   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - ECHO fairly unremarkable
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension: S/p 7L NS in the ED and 4 L (total) here with
   CVP~14. Good UOP at this time.  Attributable to either pulmonary or
   urinary infection--seems to have both.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60; currently favoring levophed over fluids
   given CVP~15
   - serial lactate, LAST 1.2
   - Abd US with no ascites to tap
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4. Here, UCX grew citrobacter
   and it does seem to be sensitive to meropenem.
   - d/c gentamicin
   - consider formal ID if pt fails to improve

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presents with symptoms of a UTI and worsening productive cough/hypoxia, suggesting pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, and pneumonia.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and sepsis. The pneumonia is suspected to be healthcare-associated due to recent hospitalization and tracheostomy. The patient is being covered for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and meropenem, and gentamicin has been stopped.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/51 mmHg to 141/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, and she has received a total of 7 liters of normal saline in the emergency department and 4 liters in the ICU.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15900 cells/uL, elevated lactate levels at 9.0 mmol/L, hyponatremia with sodium levels at"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent UTIs and pneumonias. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently in respiratory failure and hypotensive, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation with Norepinephrine support. There is evidence of volume overload. The patient's sputum culture is pending, and she is being treated with antibiotics that cover Citrobacter, MRSA, and Strep species. The plan is to wean off propofol and attempt spontaneous breathing when not apneic, and then plan for extubation. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including hypotension and organ dysfunction. If not treated promptly and effectively, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death.
3. Volume overload: The patient shows evidence of volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and further respiratory compromise.
4. Pressure injuries: Due to the patient's immobility, there is a risk of developing pressure injuries, especially in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent UTIs and pneumonias who presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. She was found to be in respiratory failure (intubated) and hypotensive (on pressors), likely sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source. The patient has multiple medical conditions including T2 paraplegia, hypothyroidism, and depression. She is currently on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia or ARDS from sepsis. Some evidence of volume overload is also present.
2. Sepsis: The patient may have sepsis with possible sources including UTI or PNA. Pressor requirement is likely related to propofol.
3. Hct drop: The patient's hematocrit levels have dropped, likely from mobilization of fluid. Stools are negative for occult blood.
4. T2 Paraplegia: The patient has T2 paraplegia, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary complications.
5. Hypothroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may affect her metabolism and immune function, potentially worsening her overall condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure due to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The sputum culture is growing MRSA and Group C Beta Strep. The patient has also been diagnosed with a Citrobacter freundii UTI, which is sensitive to meropenem. Her blood cultures are negative for Legionella and influenza. She has a history of hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, traumatic spine injury, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI): The patient's central venous line and peripheral IV lines pose a risk for BSI, especially if proper infection control measures are not followed.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT/PE.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers, particularly over bony prominences.
5. Delirium: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at risk of"

   Good UOP; PT is auto-diuresisng.  Initially hypotension was clearly
   septic in orign, at this point, seems primarily related to propofol and
   requiring the minimal dose of levophed.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60; currently favoring levophed over fluids
   given CVP~15
   - serial lactate, LAST 1.2, no need to trend further unless
   decompensates
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4. Here, UCX grew citrobacter
   and it does seem to be sensitive to meropenem.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, sepsis, and paralysis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU due to hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure likely caused by healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Her sputum culture is growing MRSA and Group C Beta Strep. She has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, for her pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which seems to be primarily related to propofol and requiring the use of levophed to maintain blood pressure.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia etiology is unclear, but it is likely related to fluid shifts. She has been transfused one unit to reach a goal of 25.
3. UTI/ESBL: The patient has a history of ESBL-producing Klebsiella UTI, and her urinary culture grew Citrobacter freundii, which is resistant to fluoroquinolones and cefazolin but sensitive to meropenem.
4. HAP: The patient has developed hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure likely due to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP).

   51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis,
   presenting with CITROBACTER FREUNDII UTI and MRSA PNA.
   .
   # PNA / hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory failure: CXR this AM
   slightly better, no focal consolidation evident, but opacities
   predominantly in the lower lobes c/w PNA.  On AC as now on propofol and
   completely sedated.
   - f/u Blood Cx (NGTD), sputum Cx (MRSA, strep speciation pending),
   urine legionella (NEGATIVE), flu swab (DFA NEGATIVE, viral culture
   negative)
   - Covering for HAP given recent hospitalization and trach with vanco &
   meropenem, gentamicin stopped (reasons below). d1= [**12-18**], plan for week
   long course
   - also seem to have strep in sputum, f/u sensitivities
   - serial ABG, daily CXR
   - Albuterol MDI prn
   - Wean sedation and attempt PSV as apnea resolves.
   .
   # Hypotension: S/p 7L NS in the ED and 4 L (total) here with CVP~14.
   Good UOP; PT is auto-diuresisng.  Initially hypotension was clearly
   septic in orign, at this point, seems primarily related to propofol and
   requiring the minimal dose of levophed.
   - bolus to maintain HR~80, UOP>60
   - levophed to maintain MAP~60; currently favoring levophed over fluids
   given CVP~15
   - serial lactate, LAST 1.2, no need to trend further unless
   decompensates
   .
   # UTI/ hx of ESBL: Pt's last UTI was [**3-6**] ESBL Klebsiella with only
   intermediate sensitivity to the zosyn given in the ED.  It has been
   treated successfully with meropenem in the past and is highly reistant
   to other agents.  Her UCX from 3d PTA grew Citrobacter freundii which
   is resistant to fluroquinolones & cefazolin, but otherwise sensitive.
   That said, MIC for Imipenem listed as <=4. Here, UCX grew citrobacter
   and it does seem to be sensitive to meropenem.
   - d/c
ed gentamicin
   - continue meropenem for 14 day course for UTI
   # ANEMIA: Etiology unclear, Likely related to fluid shifts. Serial
   guiaic negative. Initail hapto negative, will repeat. Transfuse one
   unit to reach goal of 25.

The patient has been given multiple antibiotics to treat the infection, including gentamicin, meropenem, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient is currently on propofol infusion for sedation and various ICU medications such as pantoprazole, carafate, heparin sodium, and furosemide. They also have several other medications prescribed for different conditions.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/66 to 194/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has gained weight since admission.

   cc: pneumonia, ARDS
   51 yo woman, paraplegic.
   Vent-dependent with rapid shallow breathing pattern. Unclear if anxiety
   or if she has a diaphragmatic dysfunction, particularly considering her
   numerous admissions with similar pneumonia and resp failure, previously
   requiring trach. No signficant secretions.
   No acute distress. Following commands. Lungs clear. 100% on PSV 5/15
   FiO2 0.5. Vt spont only 150cc on [**6-11**], 250 now on [**6-16**].
   Although there does seem to be a significant anxiety component (pt
   tachypneic to 40s when propofol weaned), this may also represent panic
   due to resp distress/fatigue when her vent support is decreased. Would
   like to trial extubation after obtaining more information from pt
   husband or PCP regarding possible diaphragmatic injury. Even if this is
   present she might benefit from trial of extubation, with plan to trach
   if she fails, and keep trach in place (or at least the tract by
   [**Location (un) 6045**] button). If extubation is indicated will try with BiPAP
   available.
   30 min critical care time.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonias. She presents with shortness of breath, cough, and symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection. The patient is currently in respiratory failure and hypotensive, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/51 mmHg to 141/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She is currently admitted to the ICU with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 30 mmHg, and she has received a total of 3,020 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 1,192 mL in the same time period.

The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.02 mcg/kg/min and propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min for sedation. She is also receiving piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and meropenem for antibiotic coverage.

Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 120 mg/dL, potassium of 4."

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the respiratory support is inadequate or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, the patient may experience worsening respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If not managed appropriately, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has impaired skin integrity and urinary catheterization, which increases the risk of UTI. If left untreated or inadequately managed, the UTI can lead to more severe infections like pyelonephritis or urosepsis.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and if not appropriately treated, it can worsen respiratory function and lead to sepsis.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can cause decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and may contribute to respiratory distress or other complications.
6. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has a fluid balance deficit and abnormal electrolyte levels, which can affect organ function and contribute to complications if not corrected.
7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and subsequent infections.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheterization. If a clot forms, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition.

The patient's medical progress note indicates various ongoing medical issues, including respiratory failure, sepsis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and others. The potential medical complications include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis, urinary tract infection, worsening pneumonia, complications from anemia, electrolyte and fluid imbalances, development of pressure ulcers, and risk of deep vein thrombosis."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) and has small tidal volumes.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 to 141/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 197 K/uL, sodium level of 120 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, and glucose level of 120 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures are negative for any growth, while sputum culture is positive for MRSA and Group C beta-streptococcus. Urine culture is positive for Citrobacter freundii, which is sensitive to meropenem.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including an"

   HPI:
   50 yo paraplegic female (T2 injury following MVC [**1-5**]) who has a
   history of recurrent UTIs and pneumonias who presents with SOB/cough x
   a few days and UTI symptoms.  Found to be in respiratory failure
   (intubated) and hypotensive (on pressors), likely sepsis from a
   pulmonary vs urinary source.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. She was intubated due to hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure, likely caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Sputum culture is growing MRSA and Group C Beta Strep. The goal is to wean her off mechanical ventilation with the possibility of a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) and extubation tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Drug Fever: The patient developed a fever overnight, which could be due to a drug reaction. The eosinophil count suggests a possible drug fever. Monitoring for further signs of drug reaction, and if present, considering switching antibiotics.

2. Line-Related Infection: The patient may be at risk for a line-related infection, especially since she has multiple lines in place. Continuously monitoring for any signs of infection and considering a change in antibiotic therapy if necessary.

3. UTI: The patient's urine culture is growing Citrobacter freundii, which is sensitive to Meropenem. Continuing with a 14-day course of Meropenem for the UTI.

4. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension likely related to sepsis, but it has now improved. Monitoring blood pressure closely to ensure it remains stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presents with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics to cover for HAP. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure of 150/86 mmHg, heart rate of 63 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her current medications include Klonopin, pantoprazole, heparin, and sucralfate. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired skin integrity. She has a history of paraplegia, hypothyroidism, hepatitis C, and traumatic spine injury. The patient's plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation, serial ABG, daily chest X-ray, and monitoring for potential complications such as pneumonia, UTI, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing further infections, especially considering her hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. UTI: The patient has a Citrobacter freundii UTI, and recurrent UT"

   ADDENDUM
  Patient extubated without difficulty. Over the first 20
   minutes following extubation, she developed increased WOB despite
   well-controlled anxiety. After d/w patient and team, decision was made
   to reintubate patient rather than try NPPV, which would likely result
   in increased risk of aspiration and worsening pneumonia. It is likely
   that she failed extubation d/t NM weakness in conjunction with
   underlying pneumonia. Events d/w friend in detail, including
   possibility of repeat tracheostomy.
   Total time: 65 minutes, patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pneumonias. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath and UTI, leading to respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and on pressors, suspected to be in septic shock from either a pulmonary or urinary source. She has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and recent tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis. Some evidence of volume overload is present, but it appears to be resolving.
2. Sepsis: Possible sources include UTI or PNA. The patient is now resolving, off pressors, with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 and urine output greater than 60/hour.
3. Persistent fevers: An ongoing infectious work-up is needed. There is concern for drug fever given the elevated eosinophil percentage. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on exam. Discontinue the central line. Consider changing the catheter if the patient does not defervesce with antibiotic change.
4. T2 Paraplegia: The patient is on home medications including baclofen, methadone, and lyrica.
5. Hypothyroidism:"

   50 yo paraplegic female (T2 injury following MVC [**1-5**]) who has a
   history of recurrent UTIs and pneumonias who presents with SOB/cough x
   a few days and UTI symptoms.  Found to be in respiratory failure
   (intubated) and hypotensive (on pressors), likely sepsis from a
   pulmonary vs urinary source.
   # Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely [**3-6**] PNA vs ARDS from
   sepsis.  Some evidence of volume overload. Appears to be resolving. Has
   a hx of recurrent resp failure and recent trach.
   - Abx as below
   - Auto-diuresing + lasix prn to keep net negative
   - Plan to turn off propofol and extubate this am.  [**Month (only) 8**] need Presidex to
   bridge. If fails, plan on reintubation and trach.
   # Sepsis: Possible sources include UTI  vs PNA.  Now resolving, off
   pressors. Goal MAP 60, UOP > 60/h
   - Vanc/Cefepime Day [**8-9**] for MRSA and strep, day [**8-15**] for Citrobacter
   UTI
   # Persistent fevers: Infectious work-up ongoing.  Concern for drug
   fever given elevated eosinophil %. No evidence of DVT on exam.  D/c a.
   line. Consider changing CL if does not defervesce with antibiotic
   change.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Change [**Last Name (un) 350**] to Cefepime
   # T2 Paraplegia:
   - On home meds: baclofen, methadone and lyrica

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pneumonias. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. The patient was found to be in respiratory failure and hypotensive, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source. She has been intubated and on pressors.

The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and recent tracheostomy. The plan is to turn off propofol and extubate her in the morning, with the need for Prescott to bridge. If extubation fails, reintubation and tracheostomy will be planned.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory failure leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: There is a possibility of ongoing sepsis, potentially from a urinary or pulmonary source. This could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Persistent fevers: The patient's elevated temperature indicates an ongoing infection. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source and manage accordingly.
4. Drug fever: Given the elevated eosinophil count, there is a concern for drug fever. Changing antibiotics may be necessary to address this possibility.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although no evidence of DVT was found on examination, the patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, and sepsis. She is currently in the ICU with pneumonia, UTI, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, anemia, electrolyte/fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). She is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and meropenem.
2. UTI: The patient has a UTI caused by Citrobacter freundii, which is sensitive to meropenem. She will continue to receive a 14-day course of meropenem for the UTI.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator will be attempted tomorrow, but she may require a tracheostomy instead of a button placement.
4. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction. Her fevers have improved, but she will continue to be monitored. If she develops a rash, she may need to switch antibiotics. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been sent.
5. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia of chronic disease. Her daily lab results will be trended, and she"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent UTIs, pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. She has been treated with antibiotics but continues to have respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has been reintubated due to increased work of breathing and a new ventricular rhythm. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. Her blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture are pending. The patient has multiple comorbidities including paraplegia, anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorders, impaired skin integrity, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Monitoring for new or worsening respiratory symptoms, such as fever, increased sputum production, or changes in oxygenation, would be important.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent sepsis and is currently showing signs of sepsis with fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any worsening of sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pneumonias. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. She was found to be in respiratory failure, hypotensive, and likely septic from a pulmonary or urinary source.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia/hypercarbic respiratory failure, possible pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis, evidence of volume overload, and sepsis with possible sources including UTI vs PNA. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate 73 bpm, blood pressure 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin for MRSA and streptococcus pneumoniae, and meropenem for Citrobacter UTI. She is also on diuretics and lasix to manage fluid balance.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory system assessment using a sedation-agitation scale (RSBI) should"

","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP).

She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has been hospitalized and received treatment with vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Anemia of chronic disease
- Electrolyte and fluid disorder
- Impaired skin integrity
- Urinary tract infection (UTI)
- Pneumonia, other
- Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
- Sepsis without organ dysfunction

The patient is intubated and sedated, with positive sputum cultures growing MRSA and Group C beta-streptococcus. She is being weaned off mechanical ventilation with the goal of possible extubation today, although a tracheostomy may be required. The patient's blood culture is negative, and other cultures are pending.

The patient has a history of traumatic spine injury, hypothyroidism, hepatitis C, and a code status of full code. Her current medications include levophed, methadone, baclofen, lyrica, Klonopin, levothyroxine, and PPI/sucralfate.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She is currently admitted to the ICU for severe pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Citrobacter freundii. The patient remains ventilator-dependent and is likely to require either a tracheostomy or tracheostomy button for long-term respiratory support.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent need for mechanical ventilation suggests ongoing respiratory failure, which may be due to severe pneumonia or underlying lung disease.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The urine culture is positive for Citrobacter freundii, a type of bacteria that can cause UTIs. The patient's history of recurrent UTIs increases the risk of future infections.

3. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of sepsis and current infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis again, especially if the bacteria become resistant to antibiotics or if a new infection occurs.

4. Pneumonia: Although the current pneumonia is being treated, there is still a risk of developing further lung infections while the patient is immobile and intubated.

5. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia of chronic disease, which may worsen during the course of her hospital stay due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of T2 paraplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pneumonias. She presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and UTI symptoms. The patient was found to be in respiratory failure and hypotensive, likely due to sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source.

The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and recent tracheostomy. She failed extubation yesterday and is currently intubated. The patient's vital signs show hypertension, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an overall positive balance with net intake exceeding output.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 260 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging reveals persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities in the lungs.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient likely has pneumonia versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis. There is evidence of volume overload but appears to be resolving.
   - Antibiotics as below
   - Auto-diuresing with Lasix as needed to keep net negative
   - Consider tracheostomy (likely open vs recent tracheostomy) vs button +/- Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG); check Nasogastric Intubation Function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. She was successfully extubated but experienced pain and anxiety overnight, requiring medication for sedation and pain management. She was started on mechanical insufflation/exsufflation with good effect and had good urine output. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is well-nourished. Her blood work shows anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes. She has multiple medical conditions including paraplegia, hypothyroidism, hepatitis C, and a traumatic spine injury. She is currently being treated for pneumonia and UTI with appropriate antibiotics. The plan is to continue monitoring her respiratory status, diurese with lasix, avoid oversedation, and trend daily lab results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure and remains hypercarbic with significant O2 requirement. Close monitoring of respiratory status is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. UTI: The patient has a current UTI caused by Citrobacter freundii, which is sensitive to meropenem. It is crucial to complete the 14-day course of meropenem to prevent relapse or antibiotic resistance.
3. Hypertension/Hypotension: The patient has fluctuating blood pressures"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. The patient has been extubated successfully and has been doing well. However, she remains hypercarbic with significant oxygen requirement. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure due to MRSA and Group C strep pneumonia. Although she has been extubated, she continues to have significant O2 requirements and is hypercarbic. This indicates a risk of respiratory failure.

2. UTI: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and is currently growing Citrobacter freundii in her urine culture. This indicates a risk of urinary tract infection.

3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Given her history and current condition, there is a risk of sepsis recurrence.

4. Hypertension/Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have been fluctuating between the 120s and 160s. This suggests an ongoing issue with blood pressure regulation and may require further management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. She was treated with vancomycin for 7 days and has since been doing well after extubation. The patient remains hypercarbic with significant O2 requirement. She has a history of anemia of chronic disease, hypertension, traumatic spine injury, hypothyroidism, hepatitis C, and hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to persistent hypercarbia and significant O2 requirement.
2. UTI: The patient has a Citrobacter freundii UTI which is sensitive to meropenem. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy for the recommended duration.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, likely related to sepsis. Close monitoring is required, and short-acting BP medications can be used as needed. Antihypertensives may need to be started once the patient is out of the ICU.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia of chronic disease. Daily trends should be monitored, and transfusion may be necessary.
5. Spinal injury: The patient has a history of traumatic spine injury. Pain management should be restarted as tolerated by respiratory function.
6. Hypothyroid"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of T2 injury from a motor vehicle accident, resulting in paraplegia. She has recurrent respiratory failure and was previously intubated but decannulated at a rehabilitation center. She also has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is receiving invasive ventilation but has been successfully extubated.

The patient has a history of hypertension, for which she is being treated. She also has a history of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing UTI, for which she is receiving meropenem.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.3 K/uL, and normal kidney function with creatinine levels of 0.2-0.3 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure due to likely aspiration. The patient is doing well post-extubation and will continue aggressive chest physical therapy and mechanical inspiratory"

She has recurrent respiratory failure, tracheostomy after pea arrest following prolonged respiratory failure, and recurrent urinary tract infections. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and pantoprazole (Protonix). She has also been on invasive ventilation, which was stopped on 12/27/2147 at 05:03 PM.

The flow sheet data indicates that the patient's maximum temperature was 37.1°C, current temperature is 36.4°C, heart rate is within normal range, blood pressure is controlled, respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation remains stable. Her weight has increased since admission.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 1,198 mL of fluids, with 373 mL being given intravenously. She has also received a total of 3,935 mL of blood products, with 1,920 mL being given intravenously. Her urine output is within normal range. The patient's NG output is not assessed, and her stool output is also not assessed. Drains are not mentioned.

The respiratory support section shows that the patient is on standby ventilator mode, with set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PS) of 5 cmH2O, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, and plateau pressure (PIP) of 4 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 51 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 84 mmHg, and oxygen ventilation (Ve) of 3.2 L/min.

The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals that the radial pulses on both sides are not assessed, as well as the dorsalis pedis pulses."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She was admitted to the ICU with MRSA pneumonia and a Citrobacter freundii UTI. The patient has been extubated but requires encouragement to cough and clear secretions. She is still hypercarbic with significant oxygen requirements.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to persistent hypercarbia and significant oxygen requirements. Measures such as incentive spirometry, mechanical insufflator/exsufflator, and avoiding oversedation should be continued.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a confirmed Citrobacter freundii UTI. Meropenem therapy should be continued for a 14-day course. Monitoring of urine output and signs of infection is necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, likely related to sepsis. Chlorthalidone has been started for BP management, and blood pressure should continue to be monitored.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia of chronic disease. Daily trending of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed is advised.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility. Regular skin assessments and preventive measures like repositioning and pressure relief should be implemented.
6. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has improved, continued monitoring for any signs of septic rebound or new infections is important.
7. Hepatitis C: Although the patient's viral load is negative, ongoing monitoring of liver function and follow-up are necessary.
8. Nutritional support: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed, and enteral nutrition may be required. A swallow evaluation should be conducted prior to advancing the diet.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of respiratory failure, tracheostomy, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and other medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure.

From the note, it can be inferred that the patient has been experiencing recurrent respiratory failure, with the most recent episode likely being due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient underwent tracheostomy but was decannulated at a rehabilitation facility prior to the current admission.

The patient also has a history of hypertension (HTN), which is currently being managed with medication. Additionally, the patient has had a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organism, for which she is still receiving meropenem.

The patient's anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis without organ dysfunction are also noted. There are plans for further investigations, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head for possible delirium or other neurological symptoms.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through intravenous fluids (D5), arterial line for blood pressure monitoring, and a presep catheter for difficult central access. Prophylaxis measures include enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, sucralfate and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of recurrent respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications including meropenem, carafate, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 163/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as slightly low potassium and sodium levels. There are no significant abnormalities in liver function tests or kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and was recently extubated. She may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or another episode of respiratory failure.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, indicating possible hypertension. This could lead to complications such as stroke or heart disease if not managed properly.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, which can lead to complications like kidney infection or sepsis if not treated appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's hem"

","The patient's medical progress note indicates that they are currently in the ICU with multiple health issues. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 163/97 mmHg, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 75.5 kg at admission to 78.9 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,960 mL and output of 4,250 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,290 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including Carafate and Pantoprazole.

Laboratory results show low hemoglobin levels at 9.8 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 384 K/uL. The patient also has elevated creatinine levels at 0.3 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including alterations in nutrition, anxiety, anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and others.

The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial and peripheral lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening of respiratory failure, development of further infections such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection, progression of sepsis to septic shock, worsening of electrolyte imbalances, and potential worsening of kidney function indicated by the elevated creatinine levels."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and sepsis. She presented with a Citrobacter freundii UTI and MRSA pneumonia. The patient has been successfully extubated but remains hypercarbic with significant oxygen requirements. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/77 to 165/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, increased platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include several medical conditions:

1. Pneumonia: The patient had MRSA pneumonia treated with vancomycin for 7 days. She remains at risk for respiratory failure due to hypoxia and hypercapnia. The plan includes incentive spirometry, encouragement of cough, chest physical therapy, and mechanical insufflation/exsufflation.

2. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a Citrobacter freundii UTI, which is sensitive to meropenem. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, pneumonia, sepsis, and now presenting with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). She is paraplegic and has a history of hypothyroidism, hepatitis C, traumatic spine injury, and anemia of chronic disease. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia, which has been treated with vancomycin for 7 days. She continues to require significant oxygen support and has been receiving frequent chest physiotherapy in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. PRES: The patient is diagnosed with PRES, a neurological disorder characterized by symptoms such as severe headache, binocular blindness, and decreased facial sensation. Imaging studies confirm the diagnosis, and neurology recommends maintaining blood pressure between 120-140 mmHg and monitoring with an EEG. The patient's blood pressure dropped very low on the smallest doses of labetalol, so the medication was stopped, and she is now only on chlorthalidone.

2. Hypoxic & Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient still requires significant oxygen support despite treatment for MRSA pneumonia. The floor is unable to provide the necessary level of respiratory support, so she will continue to receive frequent chest physiotherapy in the ICU. Measures include incentive spirometry, encouraging cough, chest PT, mechanical insufflator/exsufflator,"

","The patient is a 65-inch, 78.9 kg male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination, the patient had a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (64-100), blood pressure of 133/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (17-27), and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction and was admitted to the ICU for further management.

During the course of treatment, the patient developed sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature within normal range, normal heart rate, and controlled blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support included oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and arterial blood gases were not provided in the note.

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 437 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 90 mg/dL.

   Patient is critically ill.
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of traumatic spinal cord injury, recurrent respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. She is now doing well post-extubation but requires aggressive chest physical therapy and mechanical inspiratory-expiratory (MIE) to improve her poor cough.
2. Hypertension: The patient presented mildly hypotensive but has since resolved.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria causing UTI. She is currently being treated with meropenem to complete on the 30th.
4. Headache: The patient is experiencing symptoms that warrant a CT scan of the head for further evaluation and symptomatic treatment.
5. Anemia: The patient's blood work shows a decreased hemoglobin level.
6. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels are abnormal.
7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may have impaired skin integrity due to prolonged immobility and critical illness.
8. Pneumonia: The patient may have pneumonia, which needs to be managed appropriately.
9. Acute Respiratory Failure (not ARDS): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of T2 injury following a motor vehicle collision. She has recurrent respiratory failure and was intubated after experiencing a pea arrest. The patient also has recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and is currently admitted to the ICU.

24-hour events include the removal of an arterial line and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/77 mmHg to 165/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), meropenem, and other ICU medications. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 711 mL, output of 2,690 mL, and a negative balance of -1,979 mL. The patient's blood products, urine output, and other drainage measurements are also documented.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and alert, with no obvious distress. Her lungs are clear bilaterally, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver function tests. However, her creatinine levels are slightly elevated at 0.3 mg/d"

   I was physically present with the housestaff team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, physical, data and assessment and plan
   with which I agree.  I would add the following comments.
   Patient is a 50 yo female with presentation with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure and found to have polymicrobial infection and now with
   successful extubation on [**2147-12-26**].  She has been able to be maintained
   on stable O2 requirements following second extubation.
   Of note, patient has had persistent hypertension with evolution of
   significant headache with cortical blindness with PRESS seen on MRI.
   Now, patient has had improved stability with antihypertensives.
   Will move to transition to medical floor with improved blood pressure
   stability, resolving headache/blindness and continued stability of
   respiratory status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old paraplegic female with a history of T2 injury following a motor vehicle collision. She has recurrent respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and recurrent urinary tract infections. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, course complicated by PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:
1. PRES: This is an unusual finding in this patient with mild hypertension, but it has been reported before. The patient's vision has dramatically improved after close monitoring and treatment.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has undergone prolonged periods of ventilation, which may lead to partial CO2 retention. 
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is unclear in etiology and may be related to pain or sympathetic drive from the ICU.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, and she is currently on meropenem to complete the course.
5. Pain management: The patient is on morphine for pain relief.
6. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level.
7. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels and fluid balance need to be closely monitored.
8. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for skin"

   51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis, now
   presenting w/ PRES
   #PRES: Per neurology this will take several days to a week for the
   cerebral edema to resolve and for symptoms to improve. Her BP dropped
   very low on smallest doses of labetalol so drip was stopped and she is
   continued only on chlorthalidone now.
   - Esmolol drip if BP rises again
   - consider captopril after first 48 hours
   .

   treated for 7 days of vanc. Still has significant O2 requirement, has
   been getting frequent chest PT in the ICU and nursing does not feel
   that floor is capable of providing this.
   - incentive [**Location (un) 2811**]/encourage cough
   - chest PT
   - mechanical insuflator/exsuflator
   - avoid oversedation, decrease klonipen dose
   - monitor respiratory status, diuresis prn
   - Albuterol MDI prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, pneumonia, sepsis, and now presenting with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). She is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical conditions including pain control, altered nutrition, anxiety, anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis, and hypothyroidism. The patient's current medications include chlorthalidone, morphine sulfate, and meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PRES: The patient's symptoms of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances are consistent with PRES. It is important to closely monitor her neurological status and manage her blood pressure to prevent further complications.
2. UTI: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and is currently being treated with meropenem. Close monitoring of her urine output and renal function is essential to prevent renal complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is still requiring significant oxygen support. Monitoring her respiratory status and providing appropriate chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry can help prevent further respiratory complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia of chronic disease. Regular monitoring of her hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed are important to maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electroly"
