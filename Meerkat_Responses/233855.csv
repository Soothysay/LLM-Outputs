   52 yo female with PMHx sig. for HTN, CHF, asthma who presents with URI
   symptoms, acute mental status changes, found to have pneumonia,
   intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  She is not requiring high amounts of oxygen.
   There is some evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT.  It's unclear
   whether this is a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, aytpical
   pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status
   changes.  CTA did not reveal a PE.  She does not seem volume
   overloaded.
   - f/u micro including flu and BAL cultures
   - at this point still too altered to extubate
   - wean sedation
   - cont empiric CTX, vanc, and levaquin
   # Acute mental status changes:  Concerning for meningitis/encephalitis.
    CSF and h/o of URI could be c/w aseptic meningitis.  Currently, she is
   too sedated for an adequate neuro exam.  Reportedly, her neuro exam was
   normal at [**Doctor First Name 2653**].  CT head does not show any acute pathology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a
   concussion from the fall.  She also had ativan, morphine, and possibly
   dilantin at the OSH; however, she was altered prior to arrival.
   - switch to propofol to assess mental status
   - f/u CSF
   - f/u MRI read
   - EEG to assess for seizures but will hold AEDs for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with significant past medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma. She presented with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection (URI), acute mental status changes, and was found to have pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and lumbar puncture has been performed. She is also receiving various medications including propofol, antibiotics, and antipyretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress, suggesting a potential respiratory failure. The presence of pneumonia on chest CT further supports this complication.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing acute mental status changes, which could be concerning for meningitis/encephalitis. CSF analysis and an MRI read are pending to further evaluate this condition.
3. Fracture: The patient has a left humeral fracture that needs to be managed with a sling and orthopedic follow-up.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension but has been holding antihypertensives for now. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential.
5. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Although the patient has a history of CHF, she does not appear to be volume overloaded at the moment. Monitoring her volume status and considering an echocardiogram would be beneficial.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo female with PMHx sig. for HTN, CHF, asthma who presents with URI
   symptoms, acute mental status changes, found to have pneumonia,
   intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  She is not requiring high amounts of oxygen.
   There is some evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT.  It's unclear
   whether this is a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, aytpical
   pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status
   changes.  CTA did not reveal a PE.  She does not seem volume
   overloaded.
   - f/u micro including flu and BAL cultures
   - wean sedation
   - cont empiric CTX and levaquin for CAP
   - start tamiflu for empiric concern given preceding URI sx
   - send BAL washings to state for PCR
   # ? tracheal injury from intubation
   Blood outside ET tube on BAL and in lung w/o e/o active bleeding.
   -Repeat BAL and if e/o active bleeding may be wise to hold off on
   extubation. If no further blood, extubate and monitor for changes in
   Hct, vitals. Concern would be for development of tracheo-esophageal
   fistula, pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum
   # Acute mental status changes:  Concerning for
   meningitis/encephalitis.  CSF and h/o of URI could be c/w aseptic
   meningitis.  Currently, she is too sedated for an adequate neuro exam.
   Reportedly, her neuro exam was normal at [**Doctor First Name 2653**].  CT head does not show
   any acute pathology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a concussion from the fall, which was
   severe enough to cause humeral fracture.  She also had ativan,
   morphine, and possibly dilantin at the OSH; however, she was altered
   prior to arrival.
   - switch to propofol to assess mental status
   - f/u CSF
   - f/u MRI read
   - EEG to assess for seizures but will hold AEDs for now
   - d/c acyclovir as no WBCs in CSF
   - no need to treat for bacterial meningitis so decrease CTX to 1g for
   PNA
   # s/p fall
   Still unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] consider further w/u for syncope when able
   to obtain more h/o from patient. No e/o arrhythmia on telemetry.
   # Troponin bump
   Was normal in ED. Peaked at 0.2 and now trending down. No change on ECG
   but does have minimal ST dep V4-V6 on ECG from ED. Would recommend
   outpt f/u. On aspirin.
   # L humeral fracture:
   - Needs sling, likely nonoperative
   - Ortho following, appreciate recs
   # HTN: Was on triamterene/HCTZ and verapamil at home
   - have been holding antihypertensives for now
   - given only peripheral access and concern for sepsis will continue to
   hold for now and treat prn
   # CHF:  Not on ACEI, [**Last Name (un) **], or Lasix at home.  Currently not volume
   overloaded.
   - monitor volume status
   - consider ECHO (also for sycope w/u if indicated)
   # Asthma:  Not currently wheezy.
   - albuterol/ipratropium MDIs prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma. She presented with upper respiratory infection symptoms and acute mental status changes. She was found to have pneumonia and intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and has been started on empiric antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and oseltamivir for suspected influenza.

Potential medical complications:
1. Tracheal injury from intubation: The patient has evidence of blood outside the endotracheal tube on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which may indicate a tracheal injury. Further evaluation is needed, and if active bleeding is present, extubation may be delayed.
2. Development of tracheo-esophageal fistula or pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum: These complications are possible due to the suspected tracheal injury.
3. Meningitis/encephalitis: The patient's acute mental status changes raise concern for meningitis or encephalitis. CSF analysis and h/o of URI suggest aseptic meningitis. An MRI of the head is pending, and the patient's sedation will be assessed with a switch to propofol.
4. Troponin bump: The patient's troponin levels have increased but are now trending down. There"

   intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  She is not requiring high amounts of oxygen.
   There is some evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT.  It's unclear
   whether this is a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, aytpical
   pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status
   changes.  CTA did not reveal a PE.  She does not seem volume
   overloaded.
   - flu swab, sputum culture, urine legionella
   - bronch for bal, assess for bleeding source
   - send CBC
   - well covered with CTX, vanc, and levaquin
   - will plan to lighten sedation, try PS
   .
   # Acute mental status changes:  This is most concerning for
   meningitis/encephalitis.  It could be a viral meningitis as she had URI
   symptoms.  The concern would be bacteria meningitis from complication
   of pneumonia.  However, she has no fever and only a very mild
   leukocytosis, no bands.  Currently, she is too sedated for an adequate
   neuro exam.  Reportedly, her neuro exam was normal at [**Doctor First Name 2653**].  CT head
   does not show any acute pathology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a concussion from the fall.
   She also had ativan, morphine, and possibly dilantin at the OSH;
   however, she was altered prior to arrival.
   - switch to propofol to assess mental status
   - attempt LP, may need to be IR guided
   - obtain MRI to assess for temporal lobe enhancement, stroke
   - EEG to assess for seizures but will hold AEDs for now

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant medical history of hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), and asthma. She presented with upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, acute mental status changes, and was found to have pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, fever, fracture of the left humerus, pneumonia, benign hypertension, and congestive heart failure. 

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is not requiring high amounts of oxygen. There is evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT, which could be a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, atypical pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status changes. A CT angiogram did not reveal a pulmonary embolism (PE), and she does not seem volume overloaded. Further investigations include obtaining a flu swab, sputum culture, urine legionella, bronch for BAL to assess for bleeding source, and sending a CBC. She is well covered with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. It is planned to lighten sedation and try pressure support ventilation (PSV).

2. Acute mental status changes: This is most concerning for meningitis/encephalitis. It could be viral meningitis as she had URI symptoms. The concern would be bacterial meningitis from complications of pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient was found down and brought to the ICU. They underwent several procedures including an EEG, bronchoscopy, and imaging studies. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are extubated. They have a history of allergies, last doses of antibiotics, and infusions. Review of systems is unchanged from admission. The patient's flow sheet shows normal blood work and imaging results. They have mild encephalopathy on EEG and no acute fractures on CT C-spine. Microbiology results are negative for influenza A and B, and CSF analysis shows no polymorphonuclear leukocytes or microorganisms. The patient is on multiple medications, including antivirals, antibiotics, and prophylactic medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient still requires antibiotics for pneumonia, indicating an ongoing infection.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are trending down, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive medication.
4. Delirium: Although the patient is oriented x2 and not agitated, they have mild encephalopathy on EEG, which could progress to delirium if not closely monitored.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on DVT prophylaxis, indicating a risk for blood clot formation.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo female with PMHx sig. for HTN, CHF, asthma who presents with URI
   symptoms, acute mental status changes, found to have pneumonia,
   intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  She is not requiring high amounts of oxygen.
   There is some evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT.  It's unclear
   whether this is a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, aytpical
   pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status
   changes.  CTA did not reveal a PE.  She does not seem volume
   overloaded.
   - f/u micro including flu and BAL cultures
   - wean sedation
   - cont empiric CTX and levaquin for CAP
   - start tamiflu for empiric concern given preceding URI sx
   - send BAL washings to state for PCR
   # ? tracheal injury from intubation
   Blood outside ET tube on BAL and in lung w/o e/o active bleeding.
   -Repeat BAL and if e/o active bleeding may be wise to hold off on
   extubation. If no further blood, extubate and monitor for changes in
   Hct, vitals. Concern would be for development of tracheo-esophageal
   fistula, pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum
   # Acute mental status changes:  Concerning for
   meningitis/encephalitis.  CSF and h/o of URI could be c/w aseptic
   meningitis.  Currently, she is too sedated for an adequate neuro exam.
   Reportedly, her neuro exam was normal at [**Doctor First Name 2653**].  CT head does not show
   any acute pathology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a concussion from the fall, which was
   severe enough to cause humeral fracture.  She also had ativan,
   morphine, and possibly dilantin at the OSH; however, she was altered
   prior to arrival.
   - switch to propofol to assess mental status
   - f/u CSF
   - f/u MRI read
   - EEG to assess for seizures but will hold AEDs for now
   - d/c acyclovir as no WBCs in CSF
   - no need to treat for bacterial meningitis so decrease CTX to 1g for
   PNA
   # s/p fall
   Still unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] consider further w/u for syncope when able
   to obtain more h/o from patient. No e/o arrhythmia on telemetry.
   # Troponin bump
   Was normal in ED. Peaked at 0.2 and now trending down. No change on ECG
   but does have minimal ST dep V4-V6 on ECG from ED. Would recommend
   outpt f/u. On aspirin.
   # L humeral fracture:
   - Needs sling, likely nonoperative
   - Ortho following, appreciate recs
   # HTN: Was on triamterene/HCTZ and verapamil at home
   - have been holding antihypertensives for now
   - given only peripheral access and concern for sepsis will continue to
   hold for now and treat prn
   # CHF:  Not on ACEI, [**Last Name (un) **], or Lasix at home.  Currently not volume
   overloaded.
   - monitor volume status
   - consider ECHO (also for sycope w/u if indicated)
   # Asthma:  Not currently wheezy.
   - albuterol/ipratropium MDIs prn

   add the following points: 62F HTN, CHF, asthma recent URI sx c cough /
   weakness / malaise x1 week, found down by niece, confused but
   conscious, BIBA to OSH, head / neck CT negative, L humeral fx -

   Agree with plan to manage acute encephalopathy and respiratory failure
   with antibiotics for CAP - will use CTX, levo and tamiflu. Await BAL
   results, continue flu precautions for now. Given hemoptysis and concern
   for tracheal lac, will rebronch today to confirm resolution and to
   exclude lower bleeding source. Continue propofol for sedation and
   transition to PSV. For altered mental status, LP negative for
   infectious process, will check spot EEG and f/u MRI read. Fall likely
   d/t medical illness, ortho eval of humeral [**Last Name (LF) 1992**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need clinical

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma. She presented with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection (URI) and acute mental status changes. She was found down and intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress. The patient has pneumonia on chest CT, possibly secondary to a viral URI or aspiration pneumonia. She also has a humeral fracture from a fall. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal injury from intubation: The patient had blood outside the endotracheal tube on bronchoscopy, which may indicate a tracheal injury. Further evaluation is needed.
2. Meningitis/encephalitis: The patient's acute mental status changes are concerning for meningitis or encephalitis. CSF analysis is pending, and an MRI has been ordered.
3. Troponin bump: The patient's troponin levels have increased, suggesting possible cardiac involvement. This requires further investigation, especially since there are minimal ST depression changes on the ECG.
4. Fall: The cause of the patient's fall is unclear and requires further evaluation. Syncope may be a contributing factor, which needs to be explored further.
5. Hypotension and hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and antihypertensive medications have been held. Close monitoring is necessary.
6. Congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma. She presented with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection (URI), acute mental status changes, and was found to have pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory distress has resolved, but she has evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT. There were concerns about a possible pulmonary embolism, but a CT angiogram did not reveal any thrombus. She did not appear to be volume overloaded.

The patient underwent various diagnostic tests including a bronchoscopy, which showed evidence of trauma thought to be from intubation. There was blood outside the endotracheal tube on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the lung, but no active bleeding was observed. Repeat BAL was unremarkable with only old blood present. Blood cultures, including CSF, were negative for growth. A CT head did not show any acute pathology, and an MRI of the brain showed chronic small vessel disease and a right parotid enhancing nodule (possibly a pleomorphic adenoma). An EEG showed mild encephalopathy but no evidence of seizures.

The patient's troponin levels peaked at 0.2 and are now trending down. There was minimal ST depression in V4-V6 on the ECG from the emergency department, and the patient is currently on aspirin. She also has a"

   add the following points: 62F HTN, CHF, asthma recent URI sx c cough /
   weakness / malaise x1 week, found down by niece, confused but
   conscious, BIBA to OSH, head / neck CT negative, L humeral fx -

   Agree with plan to manage acute encephalopathy and respiratory failure
   with antibiotics for CAP - will use CTX, levo and tamiflu. Await BAL
   results, continue flu precautions for now. Given hemoptysis and concern
   for tracheal lac, will rebronch today to confirm resolution and to
   exclude lower bleeding source. Continue propofol for sedation and
   transition to PSV. For altered mental status, LP negative for
   infectious process, will check spot EEG and f/u MRI read. Fall likely
   d/t medical illness, ortho eval of humeral [**Last Name (LF) 1992**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need clinical
   clearance of c-spine following extubation. Will also check echo and
   continue to hold antihypertensives in the setting of medical illness
   and bump in troponins. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia on chest CT and is being treated with antibiotics. It is important to monitor for any worsening of symptoms or signs of infection.

2. Tracheal injury: The patient has hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and a bloody tracheal aspirate. Further evaluation is needed to rule out any tracheal injury from intubation.

3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, and there is a plan to replete potassium. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary.

4. Troponin bump: The patient's troponin levels have increased slightly, indicating a possible cardiac event. Further evaluation and monitoring are required.

5. Fall-related injuries: The patient experienced a fall, leading to a humeral fracture. Orthopedic evaluation is needed for further management.

6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and their antihypertensive medications are being held. Blood pressure should be closely monitored.

7. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF, and it is important to monitor for signs of volume overload or cardiac dysfunction.

8. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and while not currently wheezy, they may require bronchodilators as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo female with PMHx sig. for HTN, CHF, asthma who presents with URI
   symptoms, acute mental status changes, found to have pneumonia,
   intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  She is not requiring high amounts of oxygen.
   There is some evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT.  It's unclear
   whether this is a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, aytpical
   pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status
   changes.  CTA did not reveal a PE.  She does not seem volume
   overloaded.
   - f/u micro including flu and BAL cultures
   - wean sedation
   - cont empiric CTX and levaquin for CAP
   - start tamiflu for empiric concern given preceding URI sx
   - send BAL washings to state for PCR
   # ? tracheal injury from intubation: Blood outside ET tube on BAL and
   in lung w/o e/o active bleeding. Repeat BAL wnl with only old blood and
   no e/o bleeding.
   - Monitor airway
   # AMS: This was initially concerning for meningitis/encephalitis,
   however CSF nl and cultures negative for growth. CT head does not show
   any acute pathology. Likely due to a concussion from a mechanical fall
   as pt denied LOS, CP, SOB, dizziness, or palpitations or any prodrome
   to fall. Says she simply lost her balance. She also had ativan,
   morphine, and possibly dilantin at the OSH; however, she was altered
   prior to arrival.
   - MRI to assess for temporal lobe enhancement, stroke - MRI no acute IC
   process, chronic small vessel disease, R parotid enhancing nodule (ddx:
   pleomorphic adenoma)
   - EEG - mild encephalopathy no e/o seizures
   - MS improving
   # s/p fall
   Still unclear etiology, although likely mechanical based on history.
   [**Month (only) 51**] consider further w/u for syncope when able to obtain more h/o from
   patient. No e/o arrhythmia on telemetry.
   - Consider outpatient echo
   # Troponin bump
   Was normal in ED. Peaked at 0.2 and now trending down. No change on ECG
   but does have minimal ST dep V4-V6 on ECG from ED. Would recommend
   outpt f/u. On aspirin.
   - Monitor for symptoms
   # L humeral fracture:
   - Needs sling, likely nonoperative
   - Ortho following, appreciate recs
   # HTN: Was on triamterene/HCTZ and verapamil at home
   - have been holding antihypertensives for now
   - given only peripheral access and concern for sepsis will continue to
   hold for now and treat prn
   # CHF:  Not on ACEI, [**Last Name (un) **], or Lasix at home.  Currently not volume
   overloaded.
   - monitor volume status
   - consider ECHO (also for sycope w/u if indicated)
   # Asthma:  Not currently wheezy.

   Agree with plan to manage acute encephalopathy and respiratory failure
   with antibiotics for CAP - will use CTX, levo and tamiflu. Await BAL
   results, continue flu precautions for now. Given hemoptysis and concern
   for tracheal lac, will rebronch today to confirm resolution and to
   exclude lower bleeding source. Continue propofol for sedation and
   transition to PSV. For altered mental status, LP negative for
   infectious process, will check spot EEG and f/u MRI read. Fall likely
   d/t medical illness, ortho eval of humeral [**Last Name (LF) 1992**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need clinical

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma. She presented with upper respiratory infection symptoms, acute mental status changes, pneumonia, and was intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.

The patient has multiple potential medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient requires oxygen supplementation and has evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the pneumonia, including microbiological cultures and possibly a bronchoscopy.

2. Traumatic brain injury: The patient experienced a fall resulting in a concussion. An MRI was recommended to assess for any acute intracranial processes or chronic small vessel disease. An EEG also showed mild encephalopathy but no focal or epileptiform abnormalities.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, and her antihypertensive medications have been held due to the medical illness and concern for sepsis.

4. Congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of CHF, but there is no evidence of volume overload at this time. An echocardiogram may be considered to evaluate her cardiac function.

5. Asthma: Although the patient has a history of asthma, she is not currently wheezy. Albuterol and ipratropium MDIs can be used as needed for respiratory symptoms.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory distress, pneumonia, possible tracheal injury from intubation, acute mental status changes, a fall resulting in a humeral fracture, elevated troponin levels, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing, which may worsen if not properly managed. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions such as oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia on chest CT, and it is unclear whether it is a bacterial superinfection, atypical pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and further monitoring and evaluation of the response to treatment are needed.

3. Tracheal Injury: The presence of blood outside the endotracheal tube on bronchoscopy raises concerns for tracheal injury from intubation. If active bleeding is identified, consideration should be given to holding off on extubation. Regular reassessment of the airway and respiratory status is essential.

4. Acute Mental Status Changes: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma. She presented with URI symptoms, acute mental status changes, pneumonia, and was intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress. She is now extubated and on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient had pneumonia and required intubation. She has been extubated but will need close monitoring of her oxygen saturation levels and respiratory status. She may require continued bronchodilators and antiviral medications.
2. Acute mental status changes: The patient experienced confusion and altered mental status. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, which could be due to infection, hypoxia, or other factors. Monitoring and supportive care are necessary.
3. Fall and possible head injury: The patient fell and experienced acute mental status changes. Although she denies losing consciousness and her MRI was unremarkable, she should be closely observed for any signs of worsening neurological symptoms.
4. Troponin elevation: The patient's troponin levels were elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. However, they are trending down and may be a result of acute illness or the fall.
5. L humeral fracture: The patient has a left humeral fracture, which will require orthopedic consultation for management. Nonoperative management, such as immobilization with a sling, may be appropriate.
6. Hypertension: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo female with PMHx sig. for HTN, CHF, asthma who presents with URI
   symptoms, acute mental status changes, found to have pneumonia,
   intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  She is not requiring high amounts of oxygen.
   There is some evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT.  It's unclear
   whether this is a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, aytpical
   pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status
   changes.  CTA did not reveal a PE.  She does not seem volume
   overloaded.
   - f/u micro including flu and BAL cultures
   - wean sedation
   - cont empiric CTX and levaquin for CAP
   - start tamiflu for empiric concern given preceding URI sx
   - send BAL washings to state for PCR
   # ? tracheal injury from intubation
   Blood outside ET tube on BAL and in lung w/o e/o active bleeding.
   -Repeat BAL and if e/o active bleeding may be wise to hold off on
   extubation. If no further blood, extubate and monitor for changes in
   Hct, vitals. Concern would be for development of tracheo-esophageal
   fistula, pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum
   # Acute mental status changes:  Concerning for
   meningitis/encephalitis.  CSF and h/o of URI could be c/w aseptic
   meningitis.  Currently, she is too sedated for an adequate neuro exam.
   Reportedly, her neuro exam was normal at [**Doctor First Name 2653**].  CT head does not show
   any acute pathology.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a concussion from the fall, which was
   severe enough to cause humeral fracture.  She also had ativan,
   morphine, and possibly dilantin at the OSH; however, she was altered
   prior to arrival.
   - switch to propofol to assess mental status
   - f/u CSF
   - f/u MRI read
   - EEG to assess for seizures but will hold AEDs for now
   - d/c acyclovir as no WBCs in CSF
   - no need to treat for bacterial meningitis so decrease CTX to 1g for
   PNA
   # s/p fall
   Still unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 51**] consider further w/u for syncope when able
   to obtain more h/o from patient. No e/o arrhythmia on telemetry.
   # Troponin bump
   Was normal in ED. Peaked at 0.2 and now trending down. No change on ECG
   but does have minimal ST dep V4-V6 on ECG from ED. Would recommend
   outpt f/u. On aspirin.
   # L humeral fracture:
   - Needs sling, likely nonoperative
   - Ortho following, appreciate recs
   # HTN: Was on triamterene/HCTZ and verapamil at home
   - have been holding antihypertensives for now

","The patient is a 62-year-old lady with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma. She presented with symptoms of a urinary respiratory infection (URI), acute mental status changes, and was found to have pneumonia. The patient was intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is not requiring high amounts of oxygen, but there is evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT. It is unclear whether this is a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, atypical pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status changes.
2. Tracheal injury from intubation: Blood outside the ET tube on BAL and in the lung without evidence of active bleeding. If further blood is present, it may be wise to hold off on extubation. If no further blood, extubate and monitor for changes in Hct, vitals. Concern would be for the development of tracheo-esophageal fistula, pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum.
3. Acute mental status changes: Concerning for meningitis/encephalitis. CSF and h/o of URI could be c/w aseptic meningitis. Currently, she is too sedated for an adequate neuro exam.

   symptoms, acute mental status changes, found to have pneumonia,
   intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress:  She is not requiring high amounts of oxygen.
   There is some evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT.  It's unclear
   whether this is a bacterial superinfection from her viral URI, aytpical
   pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia secondary to her acute mental status
   changes.  CTA did not reveal a PE.  She does not seem volume
   overloaded.

   - start tamiflu for empiric concern given preceding URI sx
   - send BAL washings to state for PCR
   # ? tracheal injury from intubation
   Blood outside ET tube on BAL and in lung w/o e/o active bleeding.
   -Repeat BAL and if e/o active bleeding may be wise to hold off on
   extubation. If no further blood, extubate and monitor for changes in
   Hct, vitals. Concern would be for development of tracheo-esophageal

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma. She was found down and altered mental status, possibly due to a fall. She has been intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress, diagnosed with pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has evidence of pneumonia on her chest CT. The assessment and plan include weaning sedation, continuing empiric antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, starting Tamiflu for influenza, and sending BAL washings to the state for PCR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may continue to experience respiratory distress due to pneumonia. Close monitoring and management of her oxygen levels and respiratory function are necessary.
2. Tracheal Injury: There is a concern for tracheal injury from intubation, as blood was found outside the ET tube on BAL and in the lung. Further evaluation and consideration for repeat BAL, monitoring for changes in Hct, and vital signs are recommended.
3. Acute Mental Status Changes: The patient's acute mental status changes raise concern for meningitis or encephalitis. CSF analysis and an MRI of the head should be followed up. Switching to propofol to assess mental status and holding acyclovir may be appropriate.
4. Fall-related Injuries: The etiology of the fall is still unclear. Further investigation and consideration for additional diagnostic tests, such as an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and asthma who presented with URI symptoms, acute mental status changes, and was found to have pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress but is now extubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is alert and awake. Her chest examination shows scattered rales but no wheezes. The patient's lab results indicate slightly elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, which are trending down. Imaging studies reveal nonspecific T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease, and a right parotid enhancing nodule. The patient's condition is stable, and she is ready for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient previously had pneumonia and was intubated for airway protection and respiratory distress. Although she is now extubated, there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory distress due to underlying lung pathology.
2. Acute mental status changes: The patient experienced acute mental status changes, which could be attributed to various causes such as infection, hypoxia, or other neurological conditions. Monitoring and further investigation are required to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
3. Fall-related injuries: The patient had a fall, resulting in a humeral fracture. It is"
