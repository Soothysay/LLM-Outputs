","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (EF 25-30%), previous pacemaker placement, pancreatic insufficiency, and a prosthetic knee replacement. He was admitted with melena, likely due to a duodenal ulcer. His INR was supratherapeutic, and he received two units of blood transfusion overnight. An endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed, revealing a duodenal ulcer without active bleeding and normal colonic mucosa. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 60s and blood pressure ranging from 111/49 to 123/91 mmHg. He has mild edema in his extremities but no evidence of fluid overload. Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count and slightly increased troponin level, but other cardiac markers are within normal limits. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and INR. He is currently on various medications including proton pump inhibitors, allopurinol, and simvastatin. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and plans include transfusing blood products to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) above 25, holding antihypertensives, and repeating laboratory tests. The patient has a full code status and is expected to be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). They received two units of packed red blood cells overnight, with an increase in hematocrit from 19.1% to 21.5%. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed, and the patient underwent a golytely prep overnight, producing black tarry stool initially but clear liquid stool in the morning. The patient has been kept nil per os (NPO) for possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy this morning.

Allergies include penicillins, ciprofloxacin, and adhesive tape, all causing rashes. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the ongoing GIB. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/49 to 123/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's rhythm is set to atrioventricular paced.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,603 mL and output of 600 mL through urine and 850 mL through NG drainage. Total fluid input is 4,162 mL, with a total fluid output of 3"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 25-30%), previous pacemaker placement, pancreatic insufficiency, and a prosthetic knee replacement. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and found to have a non-bleeding duodenal ulcer. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to significant blood loss. His hemoglobin concentration increased from 21.1% to 28.5%. He is currently receiving pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor) for stress ulcer prophylaxis and heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/44 mmHg to 76/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. He is currently on mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 6,861 mL and output of 2,450 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,411 mL. 

Physical examination reveals fine rales at the lung bases, regular heart rhythm, soft abdomen, and trace bilateral edema. The"
