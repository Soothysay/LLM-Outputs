   Imaging: [**3-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-9-6**], the LV
   systolic funciton appears slightly less vigorous
   [**3-21**] CXR: Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged location. Lung volumes are
   low causing bronchovascular crowding and exaggeration of
   cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Marked cardiomegaly is stable. There is
   mild pulmonary edema. Right costophrenic angle is excluded from the
   field of view. There is a small left pleural effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema, stable severe cardiomegaly and a
   small left pleural effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo f with hx of asthma, pulm htn, sarcoid and dCHF, on chronic trach
   with new worsening SOB and hypoxia and hypercarbia in setting of
   increased secretions, concern for CHF exacerbation and possible PNA.
   # Shortness of breath/CHF: Patient with multiple reasons to have
   dyspnea including scarcoid, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic
   CHF. Pt is now having a resp acidosis and hypoxia. Symptoms came on
   over last 24 hours per pt. Xray is concerning for pulm edema and BNP is
   elevated which are both concerning for CHF exacerbation. Right heart
   cath [**6-17**] showed sever diastolic dysfunction and pulm htn. She does
   have an elevated Cr, but this may be due to poor forward flow since the
   pt appears fluid overloaded on exam. However, her thick secretions are
   concerning also for infection. It is difficult to tell on the CXR if
   there is also an infiltrate.
   -will change her trach to a cuffed trach, so pt can be vented if needed
   -aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -continue home nebs (albuterol, iprat and mucomyst)
   -continue home advair
   -will dieresis with goal negative 1 liter today (responses to 80IV)
   -will check urine, sputum, and blood cx
   -PM lytes
   -will empirically tx pna with cefepime and flagyl, will hold off on
   vanco due to allergy but if febrile will add linezolid (but would need
   to stop the SSRI)
   # Acute on chronic renal failure/UTI: Cr is mildly elevated to 1.6 from
   recent 1.4. This may be secondary to poor forward flow since on exam
   the pt does not appear low on volume. However, could also be secondary
   to UTI. Prelim UA findings consistent with infection. She is at risk
   for infection due to chronic foley and recurrent past infections with
   pseudomonas as well as other GNR and enterococus.
   - UA and urine cx
   - urine lytes
   - monitor UO
   - will give lasix as stated above
   - will exchange foley
   -will empirically start tx with cefepime due to prior sensitivity and
   allergy to FQ
   # EKG changes: some T wave changes in the inferior and lateral leads.
   First set of CE were negative. Pt has a hx of CABG. Cath in 05 with
   patent grafts. However due to suddenness of sx, this is concerning for
   possible cardiac event.
   - will ROMI
   - check EKG in AM
   - will check echo for wall motion defects (last one was in 08)
   - monitor on tele
   - if HR>80 and BP can tolerate it, will restart home BB
   - continue ASA and plavix
   # DMI: long hx of DM. BS today is elevated. Unclear if the pt had her
   PM lantus last night. Pt is followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**]
   - will place on home lantus and SSI
   - will consider [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   # Hyponatremia: Had a Na of 127 on admission, now 130 after lasix. Pt
   appears hypervolemic. Likely this is [**3-13**] CHF.
   - will restrict fluid to 2 liters
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Chronic anemia: hct improved from baseline
   - will monitor
   # Depression:
   - will continue home SSRI
   # Migraines: stable
   - will hold off on home meds for now
   # Chronic back pain: pt is currently hypoventilating so will hold off
   on home pain meds
   # FEN: NPO for now, will place NGT once trached, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Bowel regimen
   -Pain management with Tylenol for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of asthma, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with worsening shortness of breath, hypoxia, and hypercarbia over the past 24 hours. Her chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion. She also has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, which are concerning for CHF exacerbation. Right heart catheterization revealed severe diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms, elevated BNP levels, and chest X-ray findings suggest an exacerbation of her CHF. Aggressive pulmonary toilet, diuresis, and empirical treatment for pneumonia are planned.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure/UTI: The patient's serum creatinine level is mildly elevated, and preliminary urinalysis findings are consistent with infection. Further investigation and treatment for UTI are needed.
3. Possible cardiac event: The patient's sudden onset of symptoms and EKG changes raise concern for a possible cardiac event. Monitoring, ROMI, and checking for wall motion defects on echo are planned.
4. Poor glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and she has a history of diabetes. Management of her diabetes, including insulin therapy, is necessary.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is slightly low, and she appears hypervolemic. Restricting fluid intake and managing her CHF exacerbation may help address this issue.
6. Chronic anemia: The patient's hematocrit level has improved from baseline. Monitoring her anemia and considering further management if necessary.
7. Other chronic conditions: The patient has several other chronic conditions, including depression, migraines, and chronic back pain. These conditions should be managed appropriately.

Please note that the patient's medical history, current condition, and potential complications are complex. Close monitoring and individualized care are essential for her well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of asthma, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She has been admitted to the ICU for worsening shortness of breath, hypoxia, and hypercarbia. She is on chronic tracheostomy with increased secretions. Her current condition shows improvement in shortness of breath but still experiences dyspnea when repositioned. There are concerns about CHF exacerbation and possible pneumonia. She has a chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type 1, depression, headache, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), renal failure, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, hypoxia, and hypercarbia, along with fluid overload, suggest an exacerbation of her known CHF. It is crucial to monitor her fluid balance and continue diuresis to manage this complication.
2. Pneumonia: Although less likely due to normal white blood cell count and absence of fever, it is still important to monitor for signs of infection, especially since the patient is on chronic tracheostomy. Follow-up on sputum and blood cultures will help determine if pneumonia is present.
3. UTI: The patient's history of GU infections with pseudomonas, other GNR, and enterococcus, along"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of asthma, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. She was admitted with new-onset worsening shortness of breath, hypoxia, and hypercarbia. She has chronic tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs show high blood pressure, normal heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. She has a positive fluid balance of -4 liters and her labs indicate stable electrolytes and creatinine levels. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shortness of breath/CHF: The patient's shortness of breath has significantly improved today. She feels less short of breath, although dyspnea worsened after being repositioned/cleaned in bed. Suspect fluid overload from exacerbation of known CHF, although the reason for exacerbation is unclear. The tracheostomy was changed to a cuffed tracheostomy for potential mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia is less likely given normal WBC, afebrile state, and chronic hypercarbia.

- Continue home Advair
- Continue diuresis, goal another -1 liter today
- Follow-up urine, sputum, and blood cultures
- Monitor potassium levels

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of asthma, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. She is currently on chronic tracheostomy with new worsening shortness of breath and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding her fluid balance, with a net fluid intake of -2745 mL and output of 3555 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and furosemide (Lasix). She has a reducible periumbilical hernia and a history of urinary tract infections, including with pseudomonas, other gram-negative rods, and enterococcus. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's troponin T level is below the detection limit, and her blood gases are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications for this patient may include worsening of her chronic heart failure symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath and fluid overload, due to her dilated cardiomyopathy. There is also a concern for the development of further kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury given her abnormal renal function tests and history of medication-induced renal toxicity. Additionally, the patient's past history of urinary tract infections"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of asthma, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with worsening shortness of breath, hypoxia, and hypercarbia. The patient has chronic tracheostomy and is suspected to have CHF exacerbation and possible pneumonia.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Shortness of breath/CHF: The patient's symptoms have improved today, but she still experiences dyspnea after being repositioned in bed. This suggests fluid overload due to exacerbation of known CHF. The underlying pulmonary diseases and chronic hypercarbia may contribute to the exacerbation. A cuffed tracheostomy was changed for potential mechanical ventilation, although it does not seem necessary at this time. Pneumonia is less likely due to normal WBC count and absence of fever.

2. [Last Name (un)]/UTI: The patient's serum creatinine has improved to 0.8, which is her baseline. There is suspicion of involvement from urinary tract infection (UTI), possibly related to sympathetic vasoconstriction during CHF exacerbation. Cultures are pending. Past GU infections with pseudomonas and other GNR and enterococcus have been noted. F/u urine culture, monitor urine output, continue diuresis with Lasix, and administer cefepime for empiric"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of asthma, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoid, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with worsening shortness of breath, hypoxia, and hypercarbia. The patient has underlying chronic respiratory diseases and is chronically hypercarbic. Her tracheostomy tube was changed to a cuffed tracheostomy tube due to potential mechanical ventilation needs. Pneumonia is less likely given normal white blood cell count and absence of fever.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shortness of breath/CHF: The patient's dyspnea improved significantly today, although it worsened after repositioning in bed. There is a suspicion of fluid overload from CHF exacerbation, possibly due to hypoxia causing salt/fluid retention. The patient has significant underlying pulmonary diseases and is chronically hypercarbic. The tracheostomy tube was changed to a cuffed one for potential mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia is less likely.
- Continue aggressive pulmonary toilet.
- Continue home nebulizers (albuterol, ipratropium, and N-acetylcysteine).
- Continue home Advair.
- Continue diuresis with Lasix IV (goal of negative 2-4 liters today).
- Transition to Lasix gtt if urine output decreases.
- Follow-up urine, sputum, and blood cultures.
- Monitor electrolytes.
