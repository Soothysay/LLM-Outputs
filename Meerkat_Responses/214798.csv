   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history mild dementia and hypertension who
   presents from home with confusion and inability to perform his
   activities of daily living.  He suffered a fall with head trauma on
   [**2158-2-23**].
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Most likely related to new hemorrhage on CT scan.  Neurologic exam is
   currently non-focal with the exception of disorientation.  Unclear how
   far he is from his baseline.  UA negative.  No WBC count or fevers.  No
   localizing signs of infection.  No new medications.  Mental status
   significantly improves when restraints are removed. Mitts were placed
   overnight to prevent him from harming himself.
   - Attempt to reorient as much as possible
   - Low dose ativan for agitation (avoid haldol given Parkinson's)- will
   check thyroid profile
   - Limit medications which can worsen delerium
   # Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage:
   Right frontal lobe. Neurosurgery consulted in the emergency room,
   recommended repeat CT scan this AM as well as close blood pressure
   monitoring.  Blood pressure elevation highly correlated to agitation.
   Overnight was on nitroprusside drip to maintain SBP < 160.
   - Dose amlodipine 5 mg this AM and attempt to liberate from
   nitroprusside drip
   - Follow-up read on repeat head CT
   - Q4H neuro checks
   - Follow-up speech and swallow evaluation from this AM
   # Hypertension:
   Attempting to maintain SBP <160 as per NSGY. On nitroprusside drip
   overnight as above. Increased amlodipine to 5 mg daily. Attempt
   liberation from nitroprusside today.
   # [**Last Name (un) 5620**] Disease:
   Stable.  Increased tone and cog wheeling on exam.
   - Continue sinemet

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of mild dementia, hypertension, and Parkinson's disease who presented with confusion and an inability to perform activities of daily living after a fall with head trauma. He has an altered mental status, likely related to a new hemorrhage on the CT scan, and no signs of infection. His neurological exam is non-focal except for disorientation. He is currently on a low dose of ativan for agitation and is being monitored closely. He has an intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, and neurosurgery recommended a repeat CT scan this morning as well as close blood pressure monitoring. His blood pressure elevation is highly correlated with agitation, so he was on a nitroprusside drip overnight to maintain SBP < 160. The plan is to liberate him from the nitroprusside drip today and follow up with a read on the repeat head CT. He has a history of hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and hypothyroidism, and his medications will be continued as before. The patient's condition is stable, and he will initiate diet per speech and swallow recommendations. He is on prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and his code status is DNR/DNI."

   disorientation.  Unclear how far he is from his baseline, though
   appears much improved today.  UA negative.  No fevers.  No localizing
   signs of infection.  No new medications.  Mental status significantly
   improved with restraints removed. Has passed speech and swallow eval.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency or malignant hypertension due to elevated blood pressure.
2. Increased risk of bleeding or rebleeding from the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) due to the patient's current use of anticoagulants (heparin sodium).
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal function due to hypotension and potential hypoperfusion of the kidneys.
4. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history mild dementia and hypertension who
   presents from home with confusion and inability to perform his
   activities of daily living found to have an intraparenchymal and
   subdural hemorrhage.
   .
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to new hemorrhage on CT
   scan.  Neurologic exam is currently non-focal with the exception of
   disorientation.  Unclear how far he is from his baseline.  UA
   negative.  No WBC count or fevers.  No localizing signs of infection.
   No new medications.  Mental status significantly improves when
   restraints are removed.
   - management as above for intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
   - attempt to reorient as much as possible
   - low dose ativan for aggitation (avoid haldol given Parkinson's)- will
   check thyroid profile
   - limit medications which can worsen delerium
   .
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage:  Neurosurgery consulted in the emergency
   room, recommended repeat CT scan in AM as well as close blood pressure
   monitoring.  Blood pressure elevation highly correlated to agitation.
   - nitroprusside drip for SBP < 160
   - amlodipine increased to 5 mg daily
   - limit use of restraints as much as possible
   - low dose ativan for agitation
   - repeat CT scan in the AM
   - Q4H neuro checks

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of mild dementia and hypertension. He presented with confusion and an inability to perform activities of daily living. He was found to have an intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhage. The patient's altered mental status is likely related to the new hemorrhage on the CT scan. Neurologic exam is non-focal with disorientation. There are no signs of infection or new medications that could worsen delirium. The patient's mental status significantly improves when restraints are removed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has an intraparenchymal hemorrhage which requires close monitoring and management. Neurosurgery has been consulted, and repeat CT scans will be done to assess the progress of the hemorrhage. Blood pressure control is crucial to prevent further bleeding.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed to prevent worsening of the hemorrhage and other complications. The current blood pressure is elevated, and the patient is on amlodipine. Nitroprusside drip may be used for blood pressure control below 160.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is common in elderly patients with acute illnesses or injuries. It is important to limit medications that can worsen delirium and to reorient the patient as much as possible.
4. Dementia: The patient has a"

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently receiving multiple ICU medications. On review of systems, the patient has decreased urine output and increased blood pressure. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, but within normal limits. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, but currently not requiring supplemental oxygen. The physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for irregularly irregular heart rhythm and positive Babinski sign. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal electrolyte levels. The patient's neurological examination shows impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired motor function and range of motion. The patient has a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is currently experiencing acute confusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history mild dementia and hypertension who
   presents from home with confusion and inability to perform his
   activities of daily living found to have an intraparenchymal and
   subdural hemorrhage.
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage:  Neurosurgery consulted in the emergency
   room, recommended repeat CT scan, which showed stable bleed, as well as
   close blood pressure monitoring.  Blood pressure elevation highly
   correlated to agitation. Nitroprusside drip now off
   - cont amlodipine, currently 5 mg daily, can increase if needed
   - limit use of restraints as much as possible
   - low dose ativan for agitation (has not needed this recently)
   - neuro checks
   Altered Mental Status:  Most likely related to new hemorrhage on CT
   scan.  Neurologic exam is currently non-focal with the exception of
   disorientation.  Unclear how far he is from his baseline, though
   appears much improved today.  UA negative.  No fevers.  No localizing
   signs of infection.  No new medications.  Mental status significantly
   improved with restraints removed. Has passed speech and swallow eval.
   - supportive management for intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
   - attempt to reorient as much as possible
   - low dose ativan for aggitation (avoid haldol given Parkinson's)
   - limit medications which can worsen delerium

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of mild dementia and hypertension who presented with confusion and inability to perform activities of daily living. He was found to have an intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhage. The patient's blood pressure elevation is highly correlated with agitation, and he has been on amlodipine 5 mg daily. His altered mental status is most likely related to the new hemorrhage on the CT scan. The patient's neurologic exam is non-focal with the exception of disorientation. He has passed speech and swallow evaluation. The plan includes supportive management for the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, attempting to reorient as much as possible, using low-dose ativan for agitation, limiting medications that can worsen delirium, and continuing sinemet for Parkinson's disease. The patient also has stable hypertension and hypothyroidism, for which he is already on appropriate medication. In the ICU, he is receiving regular diet with nectar-thickened liquids and crushed pills with puree. He has two IV lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and is on DNR/DNI status. The patient will continue to receive ICU care, and social work has been involved. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Increased intracranial pressure due to the presence of intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhages.
2. Hypotension and shock if there is significant blood loss or if antihypertensive medications lead to a drop in blood pressure.
3. Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and use of indwelling lines or devices.
4. Thrombosis of the deep veins due to immobility and presence of a central venous catheter.
5. Gastric ulcers or stress ulcers due to prolonged critical illness and immobilization.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and immobilization.
7. Further deterioration in mental status or development of delirium.
8. Worsening of hypertension or hypotension.
9. Development of renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury due to decreased urine output.
10. Malnutrition due to decreased oral intake and inability to eat normally.
11. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and pressure on bony prominences.
12. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and hypercoagulable state.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's condition and potential complications. The actual clinical situation may vary, and additional information from the patient's medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests would be required to provide a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of mild dementia and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with confusion and an inability to perform daily activities. He was found to have an intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhage. Neurosurgery recommended close blood pressure monitoring, and nitroprusside drip was stopped. The patient's blood pressure elevation is highly correlated with agitation. He is currently on amlodipine and captopril for blood pressure control. He is also experiencing altered mental status, likely at his baseline, with struggles from sundowning. Verbal redirection has been effective so far. He has passed a speech and swallow evaluation. The plan includes reorientation, low-dose ativan for agitation, and limiting medications that can worsen delirium. He has hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and hypothyroidism, all of which are being managed accordingly. The patient's current ICU care includes regular diet with nectar-thickened liquids and crushed medications. He has two IV lines in place, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP precautions. The patient's wife has been informed, and he has a DNR/DNI code status with a possible transfer to rehab from the ICU."
