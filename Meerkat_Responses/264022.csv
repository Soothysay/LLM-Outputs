   -ERCP demonstrated dislodged stent. Stent removed and replaced. Pt with
   cholangitis as pus and sludge were found with stent removal.
   -Pt became hypotensive (70s/40s) after procedure. She had been on neo
   drip throughout procedure. Pt was hypotensive on floor and anesthesia
   gave a neo bolus. R Subclavian CVL and A line put in.
   -Pt started on dopamine drip through PIV until central access obtained.
   Then started on levophed via Subclavian. Continued on Levo 0.04. UOP
   dropped to 20- 25cc/hr - CVP around 17. Increased levo to 0.06 and
   bolused 0.5L and 1L LR. Per surgery this AM, ok to have UOP 20cc/hr and

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O CHOLANGITIS
   .
   #. Septic Shock:  Source most likely cholangitis as pt seen to have pus
   on ERCP with replacement of stent in CBD. Hypotension improved with
   fluid boluses and levophed. Pt still requiring pressors.  CVP approx
   17-19 although UOP low at 20-25cc/hr.
   -Per surgery, UOP> 20 cc/hr ok given her CVP is elevated and MAP has
   remained > 70.
   -Will check SvO2; if <65-70%, will transfuse to Hct >30
   -Continue Cipro/flagyl
   -Continue levophed
 wean to keep MAP >70
   -Monitor UOP with goal >20cc/hr
   -Pt
s BP may improve once off sedation and extubated
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 pt continued on ventilator due to h/o
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]. Did well on current vent settings with no changes.
   -SBT this AM
   -Extubated today
   - Post-extubation, will need Q6 hour NIF and vital capacity checks.
   can be done in SICU
   .
   #. Elevated troponin - Baseline unknown. No EKG changes and no ST
   elevations.  Patient has reported CAD with recent perstantine stress
   test which was normal. Mild renal insufficiency may be contributing.
   Also likely demand ischemia secondary to hypotensive episodes earlier
   today. Sepsis can also increase troponins.
   - Trend troponin Q8 hours
   - Repeat EKG this AM to monitor for progression
   - Holding beta-blocker, statin, ASA given non-PO and hypotension
   .
   #. Acute renal failure
 Resolved with Cr 0.8 today (Baseline 1.0-1.1).
   Given poor PO intake, likely prerenal in nature; this is support by
   BUN/creatinine ratio. Also, given recent hypotensive episodes, ATN is
   also on differential.
   - Gently hydrate; pRBCs, as above, should also help
   - Hold HCTZ, lisinopril
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - Likely related to biliary/biliary tree process, as
   above. UA without evidence of UTI. No symptoms to suggest pulmonary
   pathology.
   - Management of cholangitis as above
   - F/u blood cultures
   - F/u urine culture
   .
   #. Anemia - Macrocytic. Recent ([**2130-5-24**]) B12, folate within normal
   limits. No evidence of alcohol abuse. No colonoscopy available in our
   records. Iron studies should be checked at some point.
   - Given troponin bump, would maintain hct>25
   - Continue iron supplement per home regimen
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   #. History of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] - Per anesthesia, patient will be
   intubated for procedure. [**Month (only) 51**] have difficulty coming off of vent given
   MG.
   - Continue pyridostigmine, imuran per home regimen once extubated
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation - Pt did go into A-fib with dopamine infusion
   but currently in sinus rhythm. Not on anticoagulation.
   - Continue amiodarone once extubated
   - Continue ASA once extubated
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II
   - Given creatinine bump, hold metformin
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Hypertension - Episodes of hypotension earlier today.
   - In anticipation of upcoming surgery, continue beta-blocker
   - Hold HCTZ, lisinopril, Imuran
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue Synthroid per home regimen once extubated

   Disposition: ICU for now. To SICU after extubation and pending SvO2
   measurement and need for transfusion.
","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] with a complex medical history, including cholangitis, septic shock, respiratory failure, elevated troponin, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, anemia, myasthenia gravis, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient underwent an endoscopy procedure and experienced hypotension afterwards, which improved with fluid boluses and levophed. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and low urine output indicate septic shock, likely secondary to cholangitis. Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and laboratory values is essential. Pressors may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation due to myasthenia gravis. Extubation will be considered once the patient shows improvement in their respiratory status. Post-extubation, the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress or obstruction.
3. Elevated Troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia or damage. Trending the troponin levels and performing repeat EKGs are necessary to monitor for any progression of cardiac involvement.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved from baseline"

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O CHOLANGITIS
   .
   #. Septic Shock:  Source most likely cholangitis as pt seen to have pus
   on ERCP with replacement of stent in CBD. Hypotension improved with
   fluid boluses and levophed. Pt still requiring pressors.  CVP approx
   17-19 although UOP low at 20-25cc/hr.
   -Per surgery, UOP> 20 cc/hr ok given her CVP is elevated and MAP has
   remained > 70
   -Continue Cipro/flagyl
   -Continue levophed
 wean to keep MAP >70
   -Monitor UOP
   -Pt
s BP may improve once off sedation and extubated
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 pt continued on ventilator due to h/o
   myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]. Did well on current vent settings with no changes.
   -SBT this AM
   -Will likely be extubated today
   - Post-extubation, will need Q6 hour NIF and vital capacity checks.
   .
   #. Elevated troponin - Baseline unknown. No EKG changes and no ST
   elevations.  Patient has reported CAD with recent perstantine stress
   test which was normal. Mild renal insufficiency may be contributing.
   Also likely demand ischemia secondary to hypotensive episodes earlier
   today.
   - Trend troponin Q8 hours
   - Repeat EKG in AM to monitor for progression
   - Maintain hematocrit > 25, preferrably prior to procedure
   - Holding beta-blocker, statin, ASA given non-PO and hypotension
   .
   #. Acute renal failure
 Resolved with Cr 0.8 today (Baseline 1.0-1.1).
   Given poor PO intake, likely prerenal in nature; this is support by
   BUN/creatinine ratio. Also, given recent hypotensive episodes, ATN is
   also on differential.
   - Gently hydrate; pRBCs, as above, should also help
   - Hold HCTZ, lisinopril
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - Likely related to biliary/biliary tree process, as
   above. UA without evidence of UTI. No symptoms to suggest pulmonary
   pathology.
   - Management of cholangitis as above
   - F/u blood cultures
   - F/u urine culture
   .
   #. Anemia - Macrocytic. Recent ([**2130-5-24**]) B12, folate within normal
   limits. No evidence of alcohol abuse. No colonoscopy available in our
   records. Iron studies should be checked at some point.
   - Given troponin bump, would maintain hct>25
   - Continue iron supplement per home regimen
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   #. History of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] - Per anesthesia, patient will be
   intubated for procedure. [**Month (only) 51**] have difficulty coming off of vent given
   MG.
   - Continue pyridostigmine per home regimen once extubated
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation - Pt did go into A-fib with dopamine infusion
   but currently in sinus rhythm. Not on anticoagulation.
   - Continue amiodarone once extubated
   - Continue ASA once extubated
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II
   - Given creatinine bump, hold metformin
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   #. Hypertension - Episodes of hypotension earlier today.
   - In anticipation of upcoming surgery, continue beta-blocker
   - Hold HCTZ, lisinopril, Imuran
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue Synthroid per home regimen once extubated

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including cholangitis, septic shock, respiratory failure, elevated troponin levels, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, anemia, myasthenia gravis, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient underwent an endoscopy and multiple lumens placement. She experienced hypotension after the procedure and was started on dopamine and levophed drips. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 113/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is currently intubated and on ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient has a history of cholangitis, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock. The presence of pus and sludge in the stent removal suggests ongoing infection.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension after the procedure and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible septic shock secondary to cholangitis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of myasthenia gravis and current need for ventilatory support indicate the possibility of respiratory failure.
4. Elevated Troponin Levels: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which could"

   83 yof cholangitis, sepsis, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated for procedure.  No evidence for lung
   pathology.  RSBI favorable.  Plan to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, may be in part attributable to
   sedatives.
   ANEMIA -- would replete to Hct >27.
   SEPSIS -- main concern is cholangitis (biliary obstruction).
   Responding to current level of care.
   TACHYCARDIA -- developed during dopamine infusion.  Resolved after
   discontinuing dopamine.
   ELEVATED TROPONIN -- attributable to sepsis or demand ischemia.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event/ACS.  Monitor serial troponins and ECG.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K>4.0.
   BILIARY OBSTRUCTION -- attributed to ampulary carcinoma.  Now with new
   biliary stent placed.   ERCP team to follow.
   AMPULLARY CARCINOMA -- awaiting Whipple procedure, scheduled for next
   week (once infection clears).
   [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 9529**] [**Last Name (un) **] -- may contribute to respiriatory function.  Continue

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of cholangitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated for an ERCP procedure and experienced transient hypotension during the procedure, requiring vasopressor support. Upon return to the MICU, the patient remained hypotensive and required dopamine and levophed for hemodynamic support. The patient is still intubated and received 2 units of packed red blood cells for anemia.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, morphine, and codeine. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 07/10/2130 at 10:45 PM and metronidazole on 07/11/2130 at 05:18 AM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F) and 36.3°C (97.3°F)
