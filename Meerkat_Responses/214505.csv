   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Fevers: Differential includes RLL fluid collection which is most
   likely source of hypotension.  SVRs and CVP not consistent with septic
   shock, however WBCs with bands today and pt continues to be febrile.
   All blood cultures have been negative to date and LP done yesterday
   showed a negative gram stain with only 1 WBC. Medications can also
   contribute to fever as well as subdural hematomas.
   -follow up cultures- blood, sputum, CSF
   - f/u final Chest CT read, speak with IR regarding drainage
   -follow up BAL cultures from bronch
   -continue linezolid for MRSA VAP
   -send surveillence cultures
   -cooling blanket prn
   -follow fever curve
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test today
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely etiology is septic shock, although CVP and SVR
   more consistent with cardiogenic shock.  Given overall clinical
   picture, sepsis is most likely etiology.  Pt responded to IV fluids
   without requiring pressors last night.  Lactate 1.2 which may be in the
   setting of volume resuscitated sepsis.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed.
   - switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   -lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
    -f/u BAL
   -nebs and suctioning
   -minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl
   .
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.
   -appreciate neurology recs
   -f/u final EEG read
   -hold as many sedating medications as possible with daily wake up
   -monitor neuro exams
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Differential includes Tylenol toxicity, medication
   effects, hepatic abscess or early stages of shock liver given
   hypotension and sepsis; however I think this is less likely.
   - RUQ U/S
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   -monitor on tele
   -f/u TSH (was lowish range on admission which was likely sick euthyroid
   related, but if came back undetectable, hyperthyroidism could account
   for tachycardia and even fevers)
   -continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   -continue keppra for seizure ppx
   -neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for
   surveillence
   .
   # Hyponatremia: now low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine. Checking TSH as above.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   - Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   .
   # FEN: on tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars, replete lytes PRN.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   .
   # Access: Lines LSC and aline are new [**2156-12-21**].

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   .
   # fevers: There are many potential sources for infection. He has a
   right pleural effusion which could be a source, empyema, pneumonia. His
   sputum is growing MRSA. Also has hygromas and residual blood in his
   subdural space, last CT scan suggests right parietal hypodense area
   which could be infectious. Last urinalysis from yesterday was not
   overly convincing for infection; he does not seem to have abdominal
   tenderness or profuse diarrhea to suggest C diff infection. Sinus
   infection also on the differential as is a central process for
   hyperthermia. He did have a bronch today which reportedly was not very
   impressive with only thin secretions but maybe signs of trachitis. All
   blood cultures have been negative to date and LP done yesterday showed
   a negative gram stain with only 1 WBC. His original central line was
   discontinued and left subclavian line was just placed yesterday. He
   also does have an aline in place. Medications can also contribute to
   fever. He was recently on high doses of seroquel, haldol and benzos for
   agitation. They were discontinued yesterday. He is still on reglan,
   zofran and meperidine both of which could contribute to altered mental
   status.
   -follow up cultures- blood, sputum, CSF
   -chest CT to see if effusion is loculated and then may need IP to do
   thoracentesis vs VATS for clean out.
   -follow up BAL from bronch today
   -continue linezolid for MRSA VAP but discontinue aztreonam.
   -send surveillence cultures
   -cooling blanket prn
   -follow fever curve
   .
   # respiratory failure: currently trach in place and on ventilator
   requiring FIO2 of 0.6 with high tital volumes. This could be secondary
   to a MRSA pneumonia. Also concern for the pleural fluid and ? empyema
   contributing. Could also be secondary to altered mental status or even
   a central process given the head bleed. His CXR also suggests fluid
   overload.
   -try a trial of pressure support [**1-28**] and see how he tolerates it
   -lasix gtt for diuresis
   -CT chest as above
   -f/u BAL
   -nebs and suctioning
   -continue sedation for comfort but give trials off sedation
   -continue albuterol/ipratropium
   .
   # mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. He had an LP yesterday which did not
   show any organisms or suggest any meningitis.
   -appreciate neurology recs
   -f/u final EEG read
   -hold as many sedating medications as possible with daily wake up
   -monitor neuro exams
   -d/c reglan, zofran, meperidine
   .
   # tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process. I do not think he is intravascularly dry
   causing tachycardia. Agitation could also contribute.
   -monitor on tele
   -check TSH (was lowish range on admission which was likely sick
   euthyroid related, but if came back undetectable, hyperthyroidism could
   account for tachycardia and even fevers)
   -continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   -continue keppra for seizure ppx
   -neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for
   surveillence
   .
   # hyponatremia: now low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas. Continue sodium bicarb for now and monitor.
   .
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine. Checking TSH as above.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive. continue metoprolol. d/c amlodipine and
   hydralazine for now.
   .
   # FEN: on tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control
   and increase scale for tighter control.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care. Lines LSC and
   aline are new [**2156-12-21**].

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall and has been hospitalized with complications including tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. 

The patient has been experiencing rigors, high fever, and hypotension, which could be signs of infection. His sputum is growing MRSA, and there is a right pleural effusion that could be a source of infection. Additionally, the patient has hygromas and residual blood in his subdural space, suggesting possible infectious etiology. The last urinalysis did not show convincing signs of infection, and there is no evidence of sinus infection or central nervous system infection based on the negative gram stain and low white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid.

The patient is currently on multiple medications that can contribute to fever and altered mental status. Blood cultures have been negative, and the central line has been discontinued. Further follow-up cultures, including blood, sputum, and cerebrospinal fluid, are planned to identify the source of infection. A chest CT will be performed to assess the pleural effusion and determine if thoracentesis or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is necessary for cleaning out the effusion.

The patient is also being weaned off sedating medications to assess mental status improvement. The"

   shock, however WBCs with bands today and pt continues to be febrile.
   All blood cultures have been negative to date and LP done yesterday
   showed a negative gram stain with only 1 WBC. Medications can also
   contribute to fever as well as subdural hematomas.
   -follow up cultures- blood, sputum, CSF

   -continue linezolid for MRSA VAP
   -send surveillence cultures
   -cooling blanket prn
   -follow fever curve
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test today
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely etiology is septic shock, although CVP and SVR
   more consistent with cardiogenic shock.  Given overall clinical
   picture, sepsis is most likely etiology.  Pt responded to IV fluids
   without requiring pressors last night.  Lactate 1.2 which may be in the
   setting of volume resuscitated sepsis.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who was admitted for the evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. During hospitalization, he experienced a tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes a right lower lobe fluid collection, which is likely the source of hypotension. The patient's WBC count with bands suggests an ongoing infection. Blood cultures have been negative, and a lumbar puncture showed a negative gram stain with only one white blood cell. Medications and subdural hematomas can also contribute to fever. Follow-up cultures are needed, and further investigations are required to identify the source of infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient's likely etiology for hypotension is septic shock, although central venous pressure (CVP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) are more consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient responded to intravenous fluids without requiring pressors last night, and lactate levels are within acceptable range. Fluid resuscitation and diuresis as needed for blood pressure management are recommended.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Fevers: Differential includes RLL fluid collection which is most
   likely source of hypotension.  SVRs and CVP not consistent with septic
   shock, however WBCs with bands today and pt continues to be febrile.
   All blood cultures have been negative to date and LP done yesterday
   showed a negative gram stain with only 1 WBC. Medications can also
   contribute to fever as well as subdural hematomas.
   -follow up cultures- blood, sputum, CSF
   - f/u final Chest CT read, speak with IR regarding drainage
   -follow up BAL cultures from bronch
   -continue linezolid for MRSA VAP
   -send surveillence cultures
   -cooling blanket prn
   -follow fever curve
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test today
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely etiology is septic shock, although CVP and SVR
   more consistent with cardiogenic shock.  Given overall clinical
   picture, sepsis is most likely etiology.  Pt responded to IV fluids
   without requiring pressors last night.  Lactate 1.2 which may be in the
   setting of volume resuscitated sepsis.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim test
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed.
   - switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   -lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
    -f/u BAL
   -nebs and suctioning
   -minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl
   .
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.
   -appreciate neurology recs
   -f/u final EEG read
   -hold as many sedating medications as possible with daily wake up
   -monitor neuro exams
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Differential includes Tylenol toxicity, medication
   effects, hepatic abscess or early stages of shock liver given
   hypotension and sepsis; however I think this is less likely.
   - RUQ U/S
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   -monitor on tele
   -f/u TSH (was lowish range on admission which was likely sick euthyroid
   related, but if came back undetectable, hyperthyroidism could account
   for tachycardia and even fevers)
   -continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   -continue keppra for seizure ppx
   -neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for
   surveillence
   .
   # Hyponatremia: now low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine. Checking TSH as above.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   - Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   .
   # FEN: on tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars, replete lytes PRN.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   .
   # Access: Lines LSC and aline are new [**2156-12-21**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. The note includes various events and findings from the past 24 hours. The patient underwent a chest CT, which showed fluid collections that were too small to tap and no interventional radiology (IR) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed. The patient's TSH level was measured at 5.9. The patient was on pressure support ventilation overnight at a level of 50%. An EEG showed diffuse generalized slowing, with no focal deficits or seizure activity. The patient passed a [Last Name] stim test. The patient's fluid balance is +3.5L. An ultrasound of the liver/gallbladder was conducted. The arterial line was stopped at 02:30 PM and restarted at 03:20 PM.

The patient has allergies to ampicillin and unknown allergens. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 12/22/2015 at 05:00 AM, aztreonam on 12/22/2015 at 04:00 PM, and linezolid on 12/24/2015 at 02:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 4 mg/hour, fentanyl at a rate of 200 mcg/hour, and propofol at 50 mcg/kg/min. The patient is also receiving other ICU medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, which was started at 11:49 PM on 12/23/2015. Additionally, the patient is on other medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, however now afebrile X 24 hours without
   Tylenol, ibuprofen. Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   -follow up cultures- blood, sputum, CSF, BAL
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   -follow fever curve
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.
   Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors necessary.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed.
   - switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   -lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
    -f/u BAL
   -nebs and suctioning
   -minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, try to wean today
   .
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   -appreciate neurology recs
   -hold as many sedating medications as possible with daily wake up
   -monitor neuro exams
   - Zyprexa 5mg PO TID and wean propofol
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: RUQ U/S normal without hepatic abscess.  Tylenol
   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower today.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   -monitor on tele
   -continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   -continue keppra for seizure ppx
   -neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for
   surveillence
   .
   # Hyponatremia: now low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine. Checking TSH as above.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   - Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   .
   # FEN: on tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars, replete lytes PRN.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent an evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall and has since experienced several complications during his hospitalization.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Fevers: The patient has had fevers, which may be due to an ongoing infection. Staphylococcus aureus, likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), was identified in bronchial secretions. Follow-up cultures are planned to monitor the infection. Linezolid has been prescribed for 21 days.

2. Hypotension: The patient may have had sepsis, which is now resolving. Medications such as Lasix have contributed to low blood pressure. Fluid resuscitation and diuresis as tolerated by blood pressure are recommended.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be multifactorial including pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process due to the head bleed. The plan includes weaning from mechanical ventilation, decreasing FiO2 as tolerated, using nebulizers and suctioning, minimizing sedation, and following up with a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

4. Mental status: The patient's mental status is"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, however now afebrile X 24 hours without
   Tylenol, ibuprofen. Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   -follow up cultures- blood, sputum, CSF, BAL
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   -follow fever curve
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.
   Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors necessary.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed.
   - switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   -lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
    -f/u BAL
   -nebs and suctioning
   -minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, try to wean today
   .
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   -appreciate neurology recs
   -hold as many sedating medications as possible with daily wake up
   -monitor neuro exams
   - Zyprexa 5mg PO TID and wean propofol
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: RUQ U/S normal without hepatic abscess.  Tylenol
   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower today.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   -monitor on tele
   -continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   -continue keppra for seizure ppx
   -neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for
   surveillence
   .
   # Hyponatremia: now low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine. Checking TSH as above.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   - Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   .
   # FEN: on tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars, replete lytes PRN.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of fevers and respiratory failure, which may indicate an ongoing infection. The bronchoscopy showing Staphylococcus aureus, likely MRSA, further supports the possibility of a bacterial infection. Follow-up cultures are recommended to monitor for any changes in bacterial growth.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension. This may be due to sepsis resolving or medication (Lasix) contributing to low blood pressure. Close monitoring and fluid resuscitation as needed are important for managing this condition.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, and possibly secondary to altered mental status or a central process given the head bleed. Weaning from mechanical ventilation by switching to pressure support (PS) and decreasing FiO2 as tolerated is recommended. Diuretics like Lasix may be used for diuresis as tolerated by blood pressure.

4. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including medications, subdural hematomas, and infection. An EEG showed severe encephalopathy without focal deficits or seizure activity. Minimizing sedating medications with daily wake-up calls and monitoring neuro exams are important.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 64M HTN, TKR, fibromyalgia, mechanical fall
   [**10-25**] c/b progressive B SDH. Initial trip to OR c/b R PTX, taken back
   [**12-10**] and [**12-11**] for B evacs. Post op course c/b respiratory failure,
   tachycardia, altered mental status, fevers to 103, and probable MRSA
   RLL VAP. Fevers now resolved X 48 hr. Elevated LFTs (trending down)
   and RUQ USG normal. EEG severe encephalopathy. [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim and TSH
   normal.

   No new film today.
   64 yo M with complicated course, SDH, respiratory failure, fevers, now
   resolved and persistent altered mental status. Agree with plan to
   continue 21 day course linezolid for MRSA VAP.  Now AF, F/u additional
   cx data. Remains vent dependent, continue PS with slow wean to [**6-21**].
   Continue gentle diuresis with lasix drip for component of volume
   overload (goal even to neg 500). MS remains altered/decreased, likely
   multifactorial.  Continue fentanyl for pain. Continue low dose klonopin
   for element of benzo dependence / withdrawal and sedation and attempt
   to wean propofol. Continue keppra for sz prophylaxis; imaging stable
   post SDH / evac, with neurosurg following. Hyponatremia
   improved--monitor. Will continue metoprolol as able. Continue TFs with

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and recent bilateral subdural hematomas following a fall. He has been hospitalized with complications including tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation and sedation due to altered mental status. Laboratory results show elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, and a recent positive blood culture for MRSA. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated liver function tests and positive blood culture for MRSA suggest an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis or septic shock if not adequately treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to multifactorial causes such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or fluid collection. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need close monitoring as it can cause neurological symptoms like confusion, seizures, or even coma if severe.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, volume overload, or medication effects. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure to ensure organ perfusion.
5. Altered mental status: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, however now afebrile X 48 hours without
   Tylenol, ibuprofen. Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   -follow up cultures- blood, sputum, CSF, BAL
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   -follow fever curve
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.
   Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors necessary.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - PM lytes with Lasix gtt
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   -lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   -nebs and suctioning
   -minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, try to wean today
   .
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   -appreciate neurology recs
   -hold as many sedating medications as possible with daily wake up
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: RUQ U/S normal without hepatic abscess.  Tylenol
   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower today.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   -monitor on tele
   -continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   -continue keppra for seizure ppx
   -neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for
   surveillence

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after falling and suffering bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed a tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, respiratory failure, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), tachycardia, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and sepsis. There is a risk of further infections, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive lines and tubes.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or central nervous system involvement. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis or medication-induced diuresis. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be caused by multiple factors such as medication-induced sed"

   # Fevers: No clear source, however now afebrile X 48 hours without
   Tylenol, ibuprofen. Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   -follow up cultures- blood, sputum, CSF, BAL
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   -follow fever curve

   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.
   Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors necessary.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - PM lytes with Lasix gtt

   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.

   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity

   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower today.
   - continue to trend LFTs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall and has had complications including tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Fevers: No clear source, now afebrile for 48 hours without Tylenol or ibuprofen. Bronchial samples show Staphylococcus aureus, likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Follow-up cultures are needed.
2. Hypotension: Possible sepsis which is now resolving. Medications (Lasix) contributed to low blood pressure. No pressors are necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, and secondary to altered mental status or a central process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph aureus which did not have sensitivities. Switch to pressure support (PS) to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated, and lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by blood pressure.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall and subsequently developed bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he had complications such as tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS).

The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and has shown improvement in his fever without the use of Tylenol or ibuprofen. His blood cultures are pending, and sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures have been sent for speciation. The patient will continue on linezolid for a duration of 21 days.

His blood pressure has been low, which may be due to sepsis that is now resolving. Lasix has contributed to the low blood pressure, and fluid resuscitation will be given as needed. His respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process. The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial as well, including medications, subdural hematomas, and infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, however now afebrile X 48 hours without
   Tylenol, ibuprofen. Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   - Follow up cultures - blood, CSF
   - Follow up speciation of sputum and BAL cultures.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Follow fever curve
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.
   Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors necessary.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - PM lytes with Lasix gtt.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, try to wean today
   .
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Appreciate neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: RUQ U/S normal without hepatic abscess.  Tylenol
   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower today.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
 will obtain another set to evaluate trend
   again today, along with triglycerides (while on propofol).
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - Neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after falling and subsequently developed bilateral subdural hematomas, which required surgical evacuation. During his hospital stay, he experienced complications such as tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Fevers: Despite being afebrile for 48 hours without the use of Tylenol or ibuprofen, the patient has been found to have bronchial secretions showing Staphylococcus aureus (likely MRSA). Follow-up cultures and sensitivities are planned, and the patient will be started on linezolid for 21 days.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to sepsis, which is now resolving. Medications, specifically Lasix, have contributed to the hypotension. Fluid resuscitation will be provided as needed, along with Lasix for diuresis as tolerated by blood pressure.
3. Respiratory failure: This is multifactorial and includes pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, and possibly altered mental status or a central process due to the head bleed. BAL showed Staphylococcus aureus, which did not have sensitivities. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, was afebrile X 48 hours without Tylenol,
   ibuprofen, but now w/recurrent low grade temp. Could be due to
   subclavian line: site appears infected.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus,
   likely MRSA given prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was
   appropriate response.
   - Follow up cultures - blood, CSF
   - Follow up speciation of sputum and BAL cultures.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Follow fever curve
   - D/c subclavian line, culture tip, replace w/PICC line
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary at this time.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - PM lytes with Lasix gtt.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - Add diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - repeat head CT as per neurosurgery recommendation
   #Metabolic alkalosis
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] x2 days
   -          Monitor abgs
   -          Replete K+ to 4.5
   # Elevated LFTs: RUQ U/S normal without hepatic abscess.  Tylenol
   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower yesterday.
   -          Continue to trend LFTs
 will obtain another set to evaluate
   trend again tomorrow am
   # hypertrigliceridemia: likely due to propofol. TG improved to 558
   - propofol d/c
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - Neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for
   surveillance, would like another on Monday (tomorrow [**12-27**]).
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine. Checking TSH as above.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   -          Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   .
   # F: Diurese with a goal of neg 0.5-1 L over the day.

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall and subsequent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed a tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Fevers: The patient has recurrent low-grade temperatures. No clear source has been identified, but it may be related to an infected subclavian line. Cultures have been ordered to identify the causative organism.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, possibly due to sepsis which is now resolving. Medications such as Lasix have contributed to the low BP. Fluid resuscitation and diuretic management are being implemented.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process. Staphylococcus aureus has been identified in the sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures, but with no sensitivities. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is being attempted.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, had been afebrile for over 48 hours, now
   febrile this AM at 101.4. Subclavian line site appears infected.
   Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given prior sputums with
   MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   - Follow up cultures
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - start broader coverage with Levo/Flagyl given new fever today
   - Follow fever curve
   - change subclavian line
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary at this time.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - Add diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
   #Metabolic alkalosis
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] x2 days
   -          Monitor abgs
   -          Replete K+ to 4.5
   # Elevated LFTs: RUQ U/S normal without hepatic abscess.  Tylenol
   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower yesterday.
   -          Continue to trend LFTs, now normal
   # hypertrigliceridemia: likely due to propofol. TG improved to 558
   - propofol d/c
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   -          Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   .
   # F: Diurese with a goal of neg 0.5-1 L over the day.
      E: Replete PRN, want K+ to 4.5

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall. He underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.

The patient presents with several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers, which are indicative of an ongoing infection. The source of the infection is suspected to be the subclavian line site, which appears infected. Cultures have been obtained, and the patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including linezolid for MRSA coverage.

2. Hypotension: The patient may have had sepsis, which is now resolving. His mean arterial pressure (MAP) is stable, and medications such as Lasix have contributed to low blood pressure. Fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of blood pressure are recommended.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, and possibly a central process given the head bleed. Bronchoscopy and BAL cultures have shown Staphylococcus aureus, which did not have sensitivities. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and minimizing sedation with propofol/fentanyl are recommended. Nebulizers and suctioning should also be continued.

4. Mental status: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including medications, subdurals, infection, and possibly increased intracranial pressure. Neurology does not believe seizures are the cause, and lumbar puncture did not show any organisms or suggest meningitis. EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both cortical and subcortical structures. Holding and weaning sedating medications with daily wake-up calls are advised, along with monitoring neuro exams.

5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, for which diamox has been prescribed. Monitoring ABGs and repleting potassium to 4.5 are recommended.

6. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The cause of elevated LFTs is unclear, and Tylenol levels are negative. Trending LFTs and monitoring for improvement are advised.

7. Hypertriglyceridemia: This is likely due to propofol, and propofol should be discontinued.

8. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to infection/fevers or a central process. Monitoring on telemetry and continuing metoprolol with additional doses as needed are recommended.

9. Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow the patient's subdural hematomas, which appear improved/stable from prior imaging"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, was afebrile X 48 hours without Tylenol,
   ibuprofen, but now w/recurrent low grade temp. Could be due to
   subclavian line: site appears infected.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus,
   likely MRSA given prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was
   appropriate response.
   - Follow up cultures - blood, CSF
   - Follow up speciation of sputum and BAL cultures.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Follow fever curve
   - D/c subclavian line, culture tip, replace w/PICC line
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary at this time.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix as needed for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - PM lytes with Lasix gtt.
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - Add diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - repeat head CT as per neurosurgery recommendation
   #Metabolic alkalosis
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] x2 days
   -          Monitor abgs
   -          Replete K+ to 4.5
   # Elevated LFTs: RUQ U/S normal without hepatic abscess.  Tylenol
   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower yesterday.
   -          Continue to trend LFTs
 will obtain another set to evaluate
   trend again tomorrow am
   # hypertrigliceridemia: likely due to propofol. TG improved to 558
   - propofol d/c
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - Neurosurgery will let us know how often to follow up CT head for
   surveillance, would like another on Monday (tomorrow [**12-27**]).
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine. Checking TSH as above.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   -          Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   .
   # F: Diurese with a goal of neg 0.5-1 L over the day.
      E: Replete PRN, want K+ to 4.5
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  Discussing with family the option of placing PEG
   tube on Tuesday. Need to discuss with family.  To D/C TF at Midnight
   for PEG tomorrow.
   .
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall and subsequently developed bilateral subdural hematomas, which were evacuated.
2. During his hospitalization, the patient developed complications including tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.
3. The patient's current conditions and plans include:
   - Fevers: The patient had recurrent low-grade temperatures, which could be due to an infected subclavian line. Cultures have been obtained, and the line will be replaced with a PICC line. Linezolid has been initiated for 21 days.
   - Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be resolving sepsis. Medications contributing to the low BP will be adjusted as needed, and PRN fluids will be given for volume resuscitation.
   - Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, and a possible central process. FiO2 will be decreased as tolerated, and efforts will be made to wean the patient off the ventilator.
   - Mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to multiple"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male admit with bilateral sub-dural hematoma and now with
   prolonged hospital course compliacted by recurrent and now persistent
   fevers.  We have worked to keep the sedation at a minimum to allow
   reasonable evaluation of the extent and nature of recovery.  The
   concern over possible Left SCL source of infection is high but have
   been technially unable to find alternative access despite attempts at
   right SLC by anesthesia as well and with ultrasound or IJ region
   showing difficult anatomy.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Improved metabolic alkalosis and even though
   fevers are seen we see minimal evidence of worsening pulmonary
   infiltrates.  He has RR> set Rate on ventilator and will move to
   attempt wean of ventilatory support.
   -PSV today
14/12 tried
   -Will look to have PSV wean as possible
   -Minimize sedation as possible to allow move to improvement in
   ventilatory effort
   -Negative balance today with goal for 2-3 liters negative over next 24
   hours with stabilization of HCO3
   2)Sub-Dural Hematoma
   -Daily wake-up with sedation D/C to eval MS
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2396**]
   yesterday
   -Appreciate Neuro suggestions with sedation choices and will work to
   minimize sedation
   3)Fever-
   -Likely sources are extensive in the setting of prolonged illness
   checked and coming down, VAP is possible, C. Diff and possible urinary
   tract infection are all possible.
   -Will need line change today
   -Will repeat blood cultures today
   -Continue Linezolid dosing and would add Cefepime and Flagyl at this
   time after considering Amp reaction in the past
   -repeat sputum culture, send C. diff, LENI, review head CT for possible
   sinusitis
   4)Nutrition
move to place PEG tube through General Surgery given
   concern for long term feeds and inability for IP to complete procedure.
   Additional assessment and plan according to the resident note on this
   date with which I agree in full.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with bilateral sub-dural hematoma and now experiencing a prolonged hospital course complicated by recurrent and persistent fevers. The patient's sedation has been minimized to allow for reasonable evaluation of recovery. There is concern over a possible left sub-clinical source of infection, but technical difficulties have prevented alternative access.

The patient's respiratory failure has improved metabolic alkalosis, and despite fevers, there is minimal evidence of worsening pulmonary infiltrates. The patient's respiratory rate is above the set rate on the ventilator, and an attempt will be made to wean off ventilatory support.

The patient's sub-dural hematoma requires daily wake-up with sedation discontinuation to evaluate mental status. The patient's fever may be due to various sources, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, urinary tract infection, or sinusitis. A line change, blood cultures, and additional tests will be conducted to identify the source of the fever.

The patient's nutrition plan involves moving to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube through General Surgery given concern for long-term feeds and inability for intraprocedural (IP) completion of the procedure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure
2. Sub-dural hematoma
3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO)
4. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
5. Cardiac dysrhythmia
6. Sepsis without organ dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, had been afebrile for over 48 hours, now
   febrile this AM at 101.4.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA
   given prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate
   response.  Subclavian line changed yesterday.
   - Follow up cultures including catheter tip from SC line [**2156-12-28**]
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - will change coverage to include pseudomonas
 Meropenem, Linezolid,
   Levofloxacin
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary at this time.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - had gotten diamox for 2 days, alkalosis resolved and will stop this
   now
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
     .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   -          Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   .
   # F: Diurese with a goal of neg -2 L over the day.
      E: Replete PRN, want K+ to 4.5
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  Discussing with family the option of placing PEG
   tube on Tuesday. Need to discuss with family.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall and subsequently developed bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, the patient had complications including tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS).

The patient's current condition includes ongoing fevers, hypotension, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The source of the fever is still unclear, but previous cultures showed Staphylococcus aureus, likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The subclavian line has been changed, and the patient is now on a combination of antibiotics including meropenem, linezolid, and levofloxacin to cover for MRSA and pseudomonas.

The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis, which is now resolving. Lasix is being used for diuresis, and fluid resuscitation is being provided as needed. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, and possibly a central process. Efforts are being made to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation and decrease FiO2 as tolerated.

The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including medications, subdural"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, had been afebrile for over 48 hours, now
   febrile this AM at 101.4. Subclavian line site appears infected.
   Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given prior sputums with
   MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   - Follow up cultures
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - start broader coverage with Levo/Flagyl given new fever today
   - Follow fever curve
   - change subclavian line
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary at this time.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - Add diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
   #Metabolic alkalosis
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] x2 days
   -          Monitor abgs
   -          Replete K+ to 4.5
   # Elevated LFTs: RUQ U/S normal without hepatic abscess.  Tylenol
   levels negative.  Unclear etiology.  Slightly lower yesterday.
   -          Continue to trend LFTs, now normal
   # hypertrigliceridemia: likely due to propofol. TG improved to 558
   - propofol d/c
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  low normal range. Could have SIADH picture from
   subdural hematomas.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   -          Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   .
   # F: Diurese with a goal of neg 0.5-1 L over the day.
      E: Replete PRN, want K+ to 4.5
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  Discussing with family the option of placing PEG
   tube on Tuesday. Need to discuss with family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall and underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed a tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS). 

The patient has been febrile with temperatures ranging from 36.9 to 38.7 degrees Celsius. He has shown signs of hypotension with blood pressure readings as low as 105/51 mmHg. His respiratory status has been critical, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's arterial blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.39 and hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 196.

Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, small but reactive pupils, midline trachea, and distant heart sounds. Chest auscultation shows rhonchi bilaterally. The patient's extremities are cool and clammy. Neurologic examination shows sedation and no focal deficits or seizure activity. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, likely methicillin-resistant Staphy"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo amle with bilaterally SDH's and subsequent respiratory failure
   who in the setting of continued fevers and altered mental status
   patient to ICU team for further care.  He has had CVL changed for
   resolution of possible source of persistent fevers and bandemia
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with persistent ventilatiory requirement
   and slow wean of PSV being attmpted with limted success.  This
   persistent failure may be related in large part to a combination of
   chest wall restriction, patient neuromuscular weakness and persistent
   insult from pulmonary infection.
   -Continue with diuresis as tolerated--currently 1 liter negative today
   -PSV wean as tolerated
   -Would favor NIF testing if persistent failure seen
   -Ongoing Rx for possible VAP in the setting of continued fever and high
   secretion volumes are of concern
   2)Sub-Dural Hematoma-
   _Sedation to be weaned as tolerated
   -Continue with neuro exams regularly
   -Residual function and status has yet to be determined with sedation
   wean progressing slowly
   3)Fever-
   -Linezolid/Levo/Flagyl
   -Will expand to Meropenem instead of Levoifloxacin
   -Follow up culture results

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with sub-dural hematomas, respiratory failure, and fever. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has had multiple changes in his central venous line due to fevers and bandemia. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), diuretics for fluid balance, and sedatives for neuromuscular weakness. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to a combination of chest wall restriction, neuromuscular weakness, and persistent pulmonary infection. His fever is being treated with multiple antibiotics. The patient's sub-dural hematoma is being monitored, and sedation is being weaned slowly. The patient's mental status is altered, and regular neuro exams are being performed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to continued ventilatory requirements, limited success in weaning from PSV (pressure support ventilation), chest wall restriction, neuromuscular weakness, and persistent pulmonary infection.
2. Sub-Dural Hematoma: The patient's sub-dural hematoma could lead to increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, or seizures if not managed appropriately.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory process, which requires further investigation to identify the underlying cause.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been in the ICU since admission and has been experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and difficulty maintaining fluid balance. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/67 mmHg to 121/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's arterial line was removed due to erythema, and an EKG was performed. Stool culture showed Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and blood cultures were taken from the central line.

Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's fluid balance is challenging, as evidenced by the negative 875 mL balance since midnight. This could be due to ongoing losses through various routes or inadequate replacement.
2. Impaired airway clearance: The patient's respiratory support indicates impaired airway clearance, which may require assistance for ventilation.
3. Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition: The patient's mental status is altered, as reflected by impaired arousal, attention, and cognition. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Impaired balance: The patient's balance is impaired, potentially due to neurological deficits or muscle weakness.
5. Impaired motor function: The patient exhibits impaired motor function, possibly"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: No clear source, had been afebrile for over 48 hours, now
   febrile this AM at 101.4.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA
   given prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate
   response.  Subclavian line changed yesterday.
   - Follow up cultures including catheter tip from SC line [**2156-12-28**]
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - will change coverage to include pseudomonas
 Meropenem, Linezolid,
   Levofloxacin
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary at this time.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - had gotten diamox for 2 days, alkalosis resolved and will stop this
   now
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
     .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # HTN: currently normotensive/hypotensive.
   -          Lasix, Metoprolol as tolerated by BP
   -          Diamox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days
   .
   # F: Diurese with a goal of neg -2 L over the day.
      E: Replete PRN, want K+ to 4.5

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, who was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall. He underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed a tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.

24-hour events include discontinuation of levoquin, initiation of meropenem, administration of 1700cc diuresis, removal of arterial line due to erythema, three episodes of hypotension (MAPs above 60) with administration of 3 x 250cc normal saline boluses and discontinuation of lasix drip, tachycardia improving with lopressor, replenishment of calcium, and a negative diuresis of -900cc.

The patient has been febrile for over 48 hours, with a temperature of 101.4 this morning. A bronch showed Staphylococcus aureus, likely MRSA given prior sputums with MRSA. The subclavian line was changed yesterday. Cultures including the catheter tip from the SC line were obtained on [**2156-12-28**].

The patient may have had sepsis, which is now resolving. His mean arterial pressure (MAP) is stable, and medications contributing to low blood pressure were"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old overweight male who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient has been experiencing several complications during his stay in the ICU, including hypotension, tachycardia, fever of unknown origin, impaired airway clearance, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired motor function, and impaired ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in his electrolytes and fluid levels, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
2. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypotension, indicating a potential issue with blood pressure regulation.
3. Airway Clearance, Impaired: The patient may have difficulties in clearing his airways, which can increase the risk of respiratory infections or complications.
4. Arousal, Attention, and Cognition, Impaired: The patient's impaired arousal, attention, and cognition may indicate neurological complications or the effects of sedative medications.
5. Balance, Impaired: The patient's impaired balance could be due to neurological issues or muscle weakness, increasing the risk of falls and injuries.
6. Motor Function, Impaired: The patient's impaired motor function may result in difficulties in moving and performing daily activities.
7. Ventilation, Impaired: The patient's impaired ventilation suggests respiratory problems, potentially requiring additional support such as mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Continues to have no clear source and now having more
   low-grade fevers at 100.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA
   given prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate
   response.  Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - will change coverage to include pseudomonas
 Meropenem, Linezolid,
   Levofloxacin
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -1 today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - wean versed slowly
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - use Seroquel for agitation
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
     .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx

- Patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, who underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall.
- Hospitalization has been complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure.
- The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS).
- The patient continues to have no clear source of fever, with low-grade fevers at 100°F. Bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) showed Staphylococcus aureus, likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
- Subclavian line was changed, and the tip culture showed no growth.
- The patient's blood cultures showed an increase in white blood cell count (WBC), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and elevated procalcitonin levels, indicating a possible bacterial infection.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a normal pH, elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and decreased partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), indicating respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.
- The patient's physical examination revealed distant heart sounds, symmetrical chest expansion, rhonchi bilaterally, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no cyanosis or clubbing.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male admit with bilteral sub-dural hematoma and now with
   prolonged hospital course complicated by persistent respiratory failure
   with volume overload and conern for recurrent blood stream infection in
   the setting of fever and polonged time of indwelling catheters which
   have all been changed.  He has had sedation decreased and is showing
   increasing signs of responsiveness to verbal inputs but has failed to
   follow commands to my request.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Barriers to liberation from ventilation are volume overload, fever
   concerning for infection with secretions, mental status primarily
   -Will continue to attempt diuresis as blood pressure permits
   -PSV wean today
   -Will continue to trial decrease in sedation as limited by agitation
   -Would expect prolonged ventilatory support and likely chronic
   ventilator dependence
   2)Sub-Dural Hematoma-Patient with intermittent agitation charcaterized
   -Versed 3
wean by one per day
   -Fentanyl 175/hr
   -Keppra in place
   -Will repeat imaging for any changes in basic exam
   3)Fever
likely source is pulmonary and ventilator associated pneumonia
   most likely
   -Linezolid/Meropenem/Flagyl
   -Follow up cultures
   4)Agiation-
   -Weaning Versed/Fentanly
   -Seroquel as needed
   -Move to evaluate underlying mental status is essential but function is
   likely severely limited

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with bilateral subdural hematoma and now experiencing prolonged respiratory failure, volume overload, and concern for recurrent blood stream infection. The patient has been sedated but is showing increasing responsiveness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure with volume overload and fever, which may indicate infection with secretions. This could lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Sub-Dural Hematoma: The patient has intermittent agitation, and there is a need to monitor for any changes in basic exam. There is a risk of increased intracranial pressure and further neurological deterioration.
3. Fever: The likely source of the fever is pulmonary, possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient is at risk of developing sepsis or septic shock.
4. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may require careful management to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
5. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which can affect various organ functions and overall health.
6. Impaired Airway Clearance: The patient has impaired airway clearance, which can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia.
7. Impaired Arousal, Attention, and Cognition: The patient's mental status is impaired, making it difficult to assess the underlying cause and manage potential complications.
8. Impaired Balance and Motor Function:"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Causes for fever include PNA given sputum and BAL results and
   now C. Diff positive.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - continue Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   with Meropenem to cover pseudomonas and IV Flagyl
   - start PO vanco today for C. Diff, continue IV Flagyl
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -1 today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - wean versed slowly
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - use Seroquel for agitation, increase dose today
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
     .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # F: Diurese with a goal of neg -1 L over the day.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall and underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.

The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (C. Diff positive), bronchopneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (likely MRSA), and pseudomonal infection. He is currently on multiple antibiotics including linezolid, meropenem, and vancomycin for C. Diff. The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth, and his subclavian line was changed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 126 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. His kidney function is within normal limits, but his liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Other lab values, including electrolytes, glucose, and cardiac markers, are within normal"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with initial admission with bilateral sub-dural hematoma.
   He has had prolonged hosptial course with slow to improve mental
   status.  We have made substantial efforts to decrease sedation to allow
   improvement in his mental status or lack of progress to be evaluated.
   In addition, he has had recurrent fevers--mutiple sources considered
   and to date->C. Diff, Sinusistis and possible catheter related blood
   stream infection has all been likley contributing.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -PSV wean to continue as tolerated
   -In the setting of negative fluid balance will consider PEEP wean
   2)Fever-Are treating sinusitis, C. Diff and VAP
   C. Diff-=
   Sinusitis-Will complete Afrin for Rx and continue with antibiotics
   Pneuomonia is a concern but we have minimal change in pulmonary
   infiltrates and will complete course of treatment.
   Continue C. Diff for treatment for two weeks beyond last antibiotic
   Linezolid/Meropenem/Flagyl
for now
   3)Sub Dural Hematoma-
   -Sedation wean to off expected
   -Seroquel as primary [**Doctor Last Name **] for agitation
   -Appreciate neuro and neurosurgery support in consideration of
   treatment plan

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with an initial admission for bilateral subdural hematoma. He has had a prolonged hospital course with slow improvement in mental status. Efforts have been made to decrease sedation to allow for mental status evaluation. The patient has recurrent fevers, and multiple sources have been considered. These include C. Difficile infection, sinusitis, and possible catheter-related bloodstream infection. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, fever, and subdural hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a VT of 899 mL, PS of 14 cmH2O, RR of 14, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 205. These settings suggest that the patient may have difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Weaning from mechanical ventilation should be done cautiously to prevent further respiratory failure.

2. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. Difficile infection. Treatment includes antibiotics such as linezolid, meropenem, and metronidazole. It is important to monitor for symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits. Adequate hand hygiene and appropriate use of antibiotics can help prevent the spread of this infection.

   Other labs: Micro: Cdiff positive ([**12-30**]), Sputum Cx w/S.Aureus and
   G-rods. BCx from [**12-22**] -> current all no growth to date.
   CXR: no change
   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Causes for fever include PNA given sputum and BAL results and
   now C. Diff positive.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - continue Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   with Meropenem to cover pseudomonas and IV Flagyl
   - Continue PO vanco today for C. Diff, Continue IV Flagyl
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease pressure support as
   possible
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal negative today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - wean versed slowly
   .# Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity. MS
   improving as sedation is weaned.
   - Follow neurology recs
 should re-eval once patient is extubated
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   - monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - use Seroquel for agitation
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Review chart, consult cardiology if not already consulted
   - increase metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Causes for fever include PNA given sputum and BAL results and
   now C. Diff positive.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - continue Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   with Meropenem to cover pseudomonas and IV Flagyl
   - Continue PO vanco today for C. Diff, Continue IV Flagyl
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease pressure support as
   possible
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal negative today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - wean versed slowly
   .# Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity. MS
   improving as sedation is weaned.
   - Follow neurology recs
 should re-eval once patient is extubated
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   - monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - use Seroquel for agitation
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Review ch
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and has undergone multiple procedures, including evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas, tracheostomy, and placement of a subclavian line. The patient's condition has been complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, and infection, leading to the need for antibiotic therapy and source control measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be attributed to pneumonia (PNA) caused by MRSA, as indicated by positive sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) to assist with breathing. Close monitoring and weaning off the ventilator will be necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Infection: The patient has developed a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, as evidenced by a positive stool test. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat the infection and prevent its spread. Source control measures should also be implemented to minimize the risk of further infections.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, which is now resolving. Fluid resuscitation and diuretic therapy with Lasix may be required to manage fluid balance"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Causes for fever include PNA given sputum and BAL results and
   now C. Diff positive.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - continue Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   with Meropenem to cover pseudomonas and IV Flagyl
   - start PO vanco today for C. Diff, continue IV Flagyl
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -1 today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - wean versed slowly
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - use Seroquel for agitation, increase dose today
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
     .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, who was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall. The patient underwent an evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During hospitalization, the patient developed tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which have been attributed to pneumonia (PNA), positive C. diff, and Staph Aureus (likely MRSA) in the bronch. The subclavian line was changed, and the tip culture showed no growth. The plan is to continue Linezolid for 21 days, switch to PO vancomycin for C. diff, and continue IV Flagyl. Cultures will be monitored.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may have been due to sepsis, which is now resolving. Medications (Lasix) contributed to the low BP. No pressors are necessary, and urine output is good. PRN fluids will be given for volume resuscitation, and Lasix will be continued for diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Causes for fever include PNA given sputum and BAL results and
   now C. Diff positive.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - continue Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   with Meropenem to cover pseudomonas and IV Flagyl
   - start PO vanco today for C. Diff, continue IV Flagyl
   - continue to follow cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -1 today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Minimize sedation with propofol/fentanyl, switched to versed 2^nd to
   hyperlipidemia.
   - wean versed slowly
   # Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity
   - Follow neurology recs
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   -monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - use Seroquel for agitation, increase dose today
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
     .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Continue metoprolol and give more prn
   .
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # F: Diurese with a goal of neg -1 L over the day.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  PEG tube when afebrile X 24 hours.

   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who was hospitalized for evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. During his hospitalization, he developed a tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS).

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions:
1. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which are likely due to pneumonia (PNA) as evidenced by positive sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results. Additionally, he tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection. The causative organism for his respiratory infection is Staphylococcus aureus, which is likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
2. Hypotension: The patient may have had sepsis, which is now resolving. His mean arterial pressure (MAP) is stable, and medications such as furosemide (Lasix) contributed to low blood pressure. No pressors are necessary, and his urine output is good.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process given the head bleed. The BAL showed Staphylococcus"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with an initial admission for bilateral sub-dural hematoma. He has had a prolonged hospital course with slow improvement in mental status. The patient has been experiencing recurrent fevers, and multiple sources have been considered. It appears that C. Diff, sinusitis, and possible catheter-related blood stream infection have all been likely contributing factors.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, obstructive sleep apnea, subdural hemorrhage, cardiac dysrhythmia, chronic respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and agitation.

The plan includes continuing with pressure support ventilation (PSV) wean, considering PEEP wean in the setting of negative fluid balance. The patient is being treated for sinusitis and C. Diff, with plans to complete a course of antibiotics for both. Pneumonia is a concern but there have been minimal changes in pulmonary infiltrates, so the treatment will be completed.

The patient is also being monitored for SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and is on beta blockers. The plan is to uptitrate the beta blocker and review old records for apparent cardiac consultation. For the subdural hematoma, sedation wean is expected, with plans to titrate fentanyl down to 75 today and use Seroquel as the primary medication for agitation.

Neuro and neurosurgery support is appreciated in considering the treatment plan. Additional plans are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with an initial admission for bilateral subdural hematoma. He has had a prolonged hospital course with slow improvement in mental status. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation support. The plan is to continue weaning off the PSV as tolerated and consider PEEP wean in the setting of a negative fluid balance.

2. Fever: The patient has recurrent fevers, and multiple sources have been considered. It is suspected that C. Diff, sinusitis, and possible catheter-related blood stream infection are contributing factors. Treatment includes antibiotics for C. Diff and sinusitis, and linezolid/meropenem for pneumonia.

3. SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia): The patient is on a beta blocker but needs uptitration. There is a concern about cardiac consultation, as the tachycardia may not be related to sinus tachycardia.

4. Subdural Hematoma: Sedation weaning is planned to be off soon, with titration of fentanyl down to 75 today. Seroquel is being used as primary [Doctor Last Name] for agitation. Neuro and neurosurgery support is appreciated in consideration of the treatment plan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not tolerate the weaning of"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Causes for fever include PNA given sputum and BAL results and
   now C. Diff positive.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - continue Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   with Meropenem to cover pseudomonas and IV Flagyl
   - Continue PO vanco today for C. Diff, Continue IV Flagyl
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease pressure support as
   possible
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal negative today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - wean versed slowly
   .# Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity. MS
   improving as sedation is weaned.
   - Follow neurology recs
 should re-eval once patient is extubated
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   - monitor neuro exams
   - increase Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - use Seroquel for agitation
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Review chart, consult cardiology if not already consulted
   - increase metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: Diurese with a goal of negative over the day.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  PEG tube when afebrile X 24 hours.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after falling and subsequently developed bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he experienced tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.

Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers, which have been attributed to pneumonia (PNA) with sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results showing Staphylococcus aureus, likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). His subclavian line was changed, and the tip culture showed no growth.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, and secondary to altered mental status or a central process due to the head bleed. BAL showed Staph aureus, which did not have sensitivities.

3. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including medications, subdural hematomas, and infection. Neurology does not believe seizures are the cause. A lumbar puncture (LP) did not show any organisms or suggest meningitis. An electroencephalogram"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Causes for fever include PNA given sputum and BAL results and
   now C. Diff positive.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - continue Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   with Meropenem to cover pseudomonas and IV Flagyl
   - Continue PO vanco for C. Diff, Continue IV Flagyl
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease pressure support as
   possible
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -500 cc negative
   today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - wean versed slowly
   .# Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity. MS
   improving as sedation is weaned.
   - Follow neurology recs
 should re-eval once patient is extubated
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   - monitor neuro exams
   - Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - Seroquel increased to 75 mg TID for agitation
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Review chart, consider cardiology consult if not already consulted
   - increase metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: Diurese with a goal of negative 500 cc over the day.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, who presented to the hospital with bilateral subdural hematomas following a fall. His hospitalization has been complicated by a tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 155/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient appears to be tachycardic and has had episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, tachycardia without murmurs, rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no extremity edema or cyanosis. Neurologically, the patient is awake, alert, and responsive, following simple commands, and moves all four extremities spontaneously.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine, slightly low potassium, and normal liver function tests. The patient is positive for C. difficile toxin and Staphylococcus aure"

   64 yo male with initial admission with bilateral sub-dural hematoma.
   He has had prolonged hospital course with slow to improve mental
   status.  We have made substantial efforts to decrease sedation to allow
   improvement in his mental status or lack of progress to be evaluated.
   In addition, he has had recurrent fevers--multiple sources considered
   and to date->C. Diff, Sinusitis and possible catheter related blood
   stream infection has all been likely contributing.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -PSV wean to continue as tolerated
   -In the setting of negative fluid balance will consider PEEP wean
   2)Fever-Are treating sinusitis, C. Diff and VAP
   C. Diff- on Flagyl for 2 weeks after d/c of all ABX
   Sinusitis-Will complete Afrin for Rx and continue with antibiotics
   Pneumonia is a concern but we have minimal change in pulmonary
   infiltrates and will complete course of treatment.
   Linezolid/Meropenem - for now
   3) SVT: on beta blocker but need to uptitrate, review old records as

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with an initial admission for bilateral sub-dural hematoma. He has had a prolonged hospital course with slow improvement in mental status. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress, and he is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with episodes rising to the 160s, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals that he is alert but slightly agitated, with chest findings of congestive heart failure (CTA) and abdominal findings of obesity and distension. There are no edema in the extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and normal creatinine (Cr). Other lab values are within normal limits or do not show significant abnormalities.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation, and plans are to continue weaning as tolerated. In the setting of a negative fluid balance, the plan is to consider PEEP wean.

2. Fever: The patient has recurrent fevers, and multiple sources have been considered. C. Difficile infection, sinusitis, and possible catheter-related blood stream infection have all been treated. C. Difficile infection has been treated with Flag"

   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - trach mask today as tolerated with PS if needed
   - stop Lasix gtt today and continue to assess fluid status
   - Nebs and suctioning
   .# Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity. MS
   improving as sedation is weaned.  Most likely central process.  Pt is
   now receiving Versed, Clonazepam and Ativan PRN for agitation.  Will
   need to adjust meds for better control on less agents.
   - repeat head CT today per neuro
   - will stop Clonazepam, Fentanyl, Versed today and treat with Ativan
   - psych consult for further recommendations
   - Seroquel 75mg PO TID and PRN
   - continue to check ECGs for QTc prolongation given Seroquel
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - hold on Lasix today
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  Most likely from agitation
   as pt has been responsive with ativan.
   - Monitor on tele
   - metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  PEG in AM, NPO after midnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall and subsequent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During hospitalization, the patient developed tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever: The patient has tested positive for MRSA and Acinetobacter in his sputum. His subclavian line was changed, and the tip culture showed no growth. The patient is being treated with linezolid for MRSA, meropenem to cover Acinetobacter, VAP, and possible pseudomonas, IV Flagyl for C. Diff, and oral Vanc for C. Diff.
- Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, and possibly a central process due to the head bleed. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed Staphylococcus aureus, which did not have sensitivities.
- Mental status: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including medications, subdural hematomas, and infection. Neurology does not believe seizures are the cause, and a lumbar puncture did not show any organisms or suggest meningitis. An"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: Causes for fever include PNA given sputum and BAL results and
   now C. Diff positive.  Bronch showing Staph Aureus, likely MRSA given
   prior sputums with MRSA.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was appropriate response.
   Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no growth.
   - continue Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   with Meropenem to cover pseudomonas and IV Flagyl
   - Continue PO vanco for C. Diff, Continue IV Flagyl
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - Switch to PS to attempt to wean, decrease pressure support as
   possible
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -500 cc negative
   today
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - wean versed slowly
   .# Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity. MS
   improving as sedation is weaned.
   - Follow neurology recs
 should re-eval once patient is extubated
   - Hold and wean as many sedating medications as possible with daily
   wake up.
   - monitor neuro exams
   - Clonazepam to 1mg PO TID
   - Seroquel increased to 75 mg TID for agitation
   - decrease Versed with slow taper per neurosurg recs
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis, monitor BP
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Review chart, consider cardiology consult if not already consulted

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with bilateral sub-dural hematoma now with improved
   alertness in the setting of sedation weaning and capacity fo wean
   extent of ventilator support.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Trial to trach mask trials today
   -WIll continue with PSV in interim
   -Goal is for 2 hour TM trials 2x/d at a minimum
   -Return to PSV overnight
   -Will need to continue with Rx fof VAP with
   -Linezolid x 21 days
   -Meropenem to continue
   2)Sub-Dural Hematoma
   -Minimize sedating medications
   -Continue with supportive care
   3)Altered Mental Status
This is likely a combination of factors
   including the underlying hematoma insult, active infection, paradoxical
   effects of sedating medications.  Will need to find a more optimal PRN
   dosing.
   -Seroquel dosing PRN and standing
   -Ativan PRN for benzo dosing only and wean Versed to off and D/C
   Clonazepam
   -Fentanyl-will move to wean as possible

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with bilateral sub-dural hematomas and is currently in the ICU. The patient's alertness has improved while undergoing sedation weaning and has the capacity to wean off ventilator support. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, sub-dural hematoma, and altered mental status. The respiratory failure is being managed with tracheostomy mask trials, pressure support ventilation (PSV), and plans for 2-hour trials of spontaneous breathing twice a day. The sub-dural hematoma is being managed with minimizing sedating medications and supportive care. The altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors including the underlying hematoma insult, active infection, and paradoxical effects of sedating medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure - The patient may experience further respiratory distress or difficulty weaning off the ventilator support.
2) Sub-Dural Hematoma - There is a risk of increased intracranial pressure or neurological deterioration due to the hematoma.
3) Altered Mental Status - The patient may continue to have confusion or cognitive impairment.
4) HEMATEMESIS (Upper GI Bleed, UGIB) - There is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5) C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF Colitis, Clostridium difficile) - The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers and respiratory failure.
   Transferred to the MICU service, in order to further evaluate
   persistent fevers and AMS.
   .
   # Fevers: MRSA in sputum and now acinitobacter.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was
   appropriate response.  Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no
   growth.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course)
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid
   collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central
   process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus which did not
   have sensitivities.
   - trach mask today as tolerated with PS if needed
   - stop Lasix gtt today and continue to assess fluid status
   - Nebs and suctioning
   .# Mental status: likely multifactorial including medications,
   subdurals, infection all are likely contributing. Neurology does not
   feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any organisms or
   suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy of both
   cortical and subcortical structures which  may be due to increased
   intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity. MS
   improving as sedation is weaned.  Most likely central process.  Pt is
   now receiving Versed, Clonazepam and Ativan PRN for agitation.  Will
   need to adjust meds for better control on less agents.
   - repeat head CT today per neuro
   - will stop Clonazepam, Fentanyl, Versed today and treat with Ativan
   - psych consult for further recommendations
   - Seroquel 75mg PO TID and PRN
   - continue to check ECGs for QTc prolongation given Seroquel
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - hold on Lasix today
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  Most likely from agitation
   as pt has been responsive with ativan.
   - Monitor on tele
   - metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  PEG in AM, NPO after midnight.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**]
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU level of care, may consider calling out to floor if

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who has been admitted to the ICU. He underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall and his hospitalization has been complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently being treated for MRSA and Acinetobacter infections in the sputum. 

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, and secondary to altered mental status or a central process given the head bleed. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including medications, subdural hematomas, infection, and other factors. Neurology does not feel seizures are the likely cause. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) that did not show any organisms or suggest any meningitis. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed severe encephalopathy of both cortical and subcortical structures, which may be due to increased intracranial pressure, without focal deficits or seizure activity. The patient's mental status is improving as sedation is weaned. The patient is now receiving lorazepam (Ativan) PRN for agitation and will need to adjust medications for better control on fewer agents. A psych consultation"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   .
   # Fevers: MRSA in sputum and now acinitobacter.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was
   appropriate response.  Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no
   growth.  Was afebrile for several days and then spiked fever again on
   [**12-30**] which we are attributing to CDiff infection.  Patient started on
   treatment for CDiff on [**12-31**].  Now afebrile since [**1-1**] at 4am.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - need to repeat sputum culture b/c last 2 contaminated
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with Hx of PNA, pulmonary edema,
   fluid collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a
   central process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus w/no
   sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum sample from the same day
   showed S. Aureus sensitive to Vanco, Gent, Tetracycline, and Bactrim.
   Had one episode of respiratory distress last night due to mechanical
   obstruction after which he had to be put back on the vent overnight.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above.
   - trach mask today as tolerated with PS if needed
   - stop Lasix gtt today and continue to assess fluid status
   - Nebs and suctioning
   .# Mental status/agitation: likely multifactorial including
   medications, subdurals, infection, long stay in ICU -> delirium; likely
   all are contributing. Neurology does not feel seizures are likely
   cause. LP did not show any organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG
   showed severe encephalopathy of both cortical and subcortical
   structures which may be due to increased intracranial pressure, no
   focal deficits or seizure activity. MS improving as sedation is weaned,
   although he has been very agitated over the last 48 hours.  Repeat head
   CT shows no change.  Psych recommendation:
   - psych consult for further recommendations
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day.
   -
   - Seroquel 75mg PO TID and PRN
   - continue to check ECGs for QTc prolongation given Seroquel
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - hold on Lasix today
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  Most likely from agitation
   as pt has been responsive with ativan.
   - Monitor on tele
   - metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  PEG in AM, NPO after midnight.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**]
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU level of care, may consider calling out to floor if
   agitation can be managed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas following a fall. The hospital course has been complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS). He underwent tracheostomy due to the inability to wean from the ventilator and sedation.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Fevers: The patient had fevers attributed to MRSA and acinetobacter infections. He was treated with linezolid and meropenem, respectively. His fever subsided after starting treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection on 12/31. The patient is now afebrile since 1/1 at 4 am.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed Staphylococcus aureus with no sensitivities, while an endotracheal sputum sample from the same day showed S. aureus sensitive to vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and bact"

   other abxs stopped
   - need to repeat sputum culture b/c last 2 contaminated
   - continue to follow cultures
   # Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with Hx of PNA, pulmonary edema,
   fluid collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a
   central process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus w/no
   sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum sample from the same day
   showed S. Aureus sensitive to Vanco, Gent, Tetracycline, and Bactrim.
   Had one episode of respiratory distress last night due to mechanical
   obstruction after which he had to be put back on the vent overnight.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above.
   - trach mask today as tolerated with PS if needed
   - stop Lasix gtt today and continue to assess fluid status
   - Nebs and suctioning
   .# Mental status/agitation: likely multifactorial including
   medications, subdurals, infection, long stay in ICU -> delirium.
   Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any
   organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy
   of both cortical and subcortical structures which may be due to
   increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity.
   MS improving as sedation is weaned, although he has been very agitated
   over the last 48 hours.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych
   recommendation:
   - psych consult for further recommendations
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day.
   -
   - Seroquel 75mg PO TID and PRN
   - continue to check ECGs for QTc prolongation given Seroquel
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt may have had sepsis which is now resolving.  MAPs
   stable.  Medications (Lasix) contributed to low BP.  No pressors
   necessary.  Urine output good.
   - PRN fluids for volume resuscitation
   - hold on Lasix today
   .
   # Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  Most likely from agitation
   as pt has been responsive with ativan.
   - Monitor on tele
   - metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   # Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status. The patient had undergone an evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas following a fall.

The patient's current condition is complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 148 bpm, blood pressure of 131/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function. Urinalysis reveals the presence of >50 red blood cells, 7-27 white blood cells, and moderate bacteria. A urine culture is pending. Stool and drain samples have also been collected for further analysis.

The patient has been diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter infection in his sputum. He was initially treated with linezolid, but it was stopped due to Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently receiving meropenem to cover Acinetobacter, ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Fevers: MRSA in sputum and now acinitobacter.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was
   appropriate response.  Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no
   growth.  Was afebrile for several days and then spiked fever again on
   [**12-30**] which we are attributing to CDiff infection.  Patient started on
   treatment for CDiff on [**12-31**].  Now afebrile since [**1-1**] at 4am.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - need to repeat sputum culture b/c last 2 contaminated
   - continue to follow cultures
   #2 Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with Hx of PNA, pulmonary edema,
   fluid collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a
   central process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus w/no
   sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum sample from the same day
   showed S. Aureus sensitive to Vanco, Gent, Tetracycline, and Bactrim.
   Had one episode of respiratory distress last night due to mechanical
   obstruction after which he had to be put back on the vent overnight.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above.
   - trach mask today as tolerated with PS if needed
   - stop Lasix gtt today and continue to assess fluid status
   - Nebs and suctioning
   #3 Mental status/agitation: likely multifactorial including
   medications, subdurals, infection, long stay in ICU -> delirium.
   Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any
   organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy
   of both cortical and subcortical structures which may be due to
   increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity.
   MS improving as sedation is weaned, although he has been very agitated
   over the last 48 hours.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych
   recommended d/c seroquel and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Patient required quite a bit of PRN Haldol and Ativan last night for
   agitation.  Because patient has been on high doses of several
   benzodiazepines, it is likely that 0.5mg Ativan [**Hospital1 **] is not enough to
   adequately wean her off of benzodiazepines.
   - Change Ativan to Valium 10mg PO TID w/Valium 5mg PO PRN.
   - Increase Haldol to 5mg TID
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  Likely from agitation as pt
   has been responsive with ativan, however over the last 48 hours the
   patient has been persistently more tachycardic (130
 140
s) than has
   been over the last few weeks. EKG shows sinus rhythm.  Concern for PE.
   Will need to discuss with neuro whether patient is anticoagulation
   candidate given recent subdurals.  Have checked TSH recently, was
   slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due to
   hyperthyroidism).
   - CTA to r/o PE
   - B/L LE U/S to r/o DVT
   - Monitor on tele
   - metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   #  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  PEG in AM, NPO after midnight.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who was admitted to the hospital after falling and experiencing bilateral subdural hematomas. The patient has had a complicated hospitalization, including tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS). A tracheostomy was performed due to the inability to wean from the ventilator and sedation.

The patient's current issues include:
1. Fevers: The patient has been febrile with MRSA and acinetobacter in the sputum. The subclavian line was changed, and the tip culture showed no growth. The patient was afebrile for several days before experiencing a spike in fever attributed to Clostridium difficile (CDiff) infection. Treatment for CDiff was initiated on December 31st. The patient has been afebrile since January 1st at 4am. The plan is to continue linezolid for 21 days, meropenem for 14 days, and oral vancomycin for 2 weeks after stopping other antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, and a possible central process. A bronchoalveolar lav"

   Imaging: Head CT--no change in SDH
   ECG: nl axis, nl QTC intervals.  Patient with tachcardia---sinus
   tachycardia
   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male admit with bilateral SDH and with prolonged course of
   respiratory failure now with good tolerance of trach mask trials.  He
   has ongoing challenges of wean of sedation in the setting of what was
   previously significant doses of benzodiazepines.
   1)Agitation-This manifests as movements, tachycardia and tremor
This
   will be continued titration in sedating medications as well as path to
   define any underlying source that my currently be unresolved
however he
   has WBC, Na+, LFT
s which have all been within normal limits of late.
   There is a real suspicion for possible withdrawl effects of rapid
   decrease in benzodiazepine dosing.  The leading sources are medication
   withdrawl, SDH, ICU delirium all contributing.
   -Will check ECG, CXR,
   -Haldol 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and will increase to 5mg [**Hospital1 **] as background
   -Valium po
will continue with 5mg doses to titrate to effect as Ativan
   has proven to be a rapid taper and may be contributing to withdrawl
   symptoms.  Start with Valium 10mg po tid
   -Fentanyl gtt continuing and will move to wean off today
   -Have considered EEG and LP for evaluation of possible sources in the
   setting of SDH and prolonged illness if not able to rapidly diminish
   agitation
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Trach in place and patient with successful wean to TM trial today
   -Continue
   3)SDH--
   -Keppra
   -Repeat CT shows no change
   4)Sepsis-
   -Vanco/Meropenem for VAP
   -Linezolid to continue for likely catheter related bloodstream
   infection
   5)Tachycardia-This is a sinus tachycardia with periodic elevations to
   140-150.  The differential for this is led by pain, discomfort,
   agitation but has failed to decrease with control of sedation.  Do not
   see evidence of alternative focus on ECG as P-wave axis is normal on
   the ECG during persistent tachycardia.
   -TSH has been sent and is normal
   -Patient with persistent tachycardia noted across past week--this has
   reliably been manifest as sinus tachycardia
   -Will scan for PE to consider diagnosis
   -Will obtain LENI
   Additional active issues to be addressed as defined in housestaff note
   of this date.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with bilateral subdural hematomas (SDH) and prolonged respiratory failure. The patient has been tolerating tracheostomy mask trials well but continues to have challenges with weaning off sedation, which has been significant in the past. 

The patient's current issues include agitation, tachycardia, and tremor, which are likely due to medication withdrawal or ICU delirium. The sedating medications such as Haldol and Valium will be continued and titrated to effect. An EEG and lumbar puncture may be considered if the agitation does not improve.

The patient also has respiratory failure, for which a tracheostomy has been placed and the patient has successfully weaned to a tracheostomy mask trial. 

SDH is still present and shows no change on repeat head CT. The patient is also suspected to have sepsis with VAP and a possible catheter-related bloodstream infection. Linezolid will continue for the latter, while Vancomycin and Meropenem will be used for VAP.

The patient has a sinus tachycardia, which is likely due to pain, discomfort, or agitation. A scan for pulmonary embolism (PE) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been sent to evaluate further.

Other issues mentioned in the note include hematemesis (upper gastrointestinal bleed), Clostrid"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with Hx of PNA, pulmonary edema,
   fluid collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a
   central process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus w/no
   sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum sample from the same day
   showed S. Aureus sensitive to Vanco, Gent, Tetracycline, and Bactrim.
   Had one episode of respiratory distress last night due to mechanical
   obstruction after which he had to be put back on the vent overnight.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above.
   - trach mask today as tolerated
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   .
   #2. C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: likely multifactorial including
   medications, subdurals, infection, long stay in ICU -> delirium.
   Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any
   organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy
   of both cortical and subcortical structures which may be due to
   increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity.
   MS improving as sedation is weaned, although he has been very agitated
   over the last 48 hours.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych
   recommended d/c seroquel and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   which has not been sufficient.  Started Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN
   and increased Haldol to 5mg IV TID.  This regimen seems to be working.
   - continue Haldol 5mg IV TID, Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Concern for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
   -check echo today
   - continue with Metoprolol 75mg PO TID for now and will reassess after
   echo
   #  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: NPO for now, plan for PEG today per surgery
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**].
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU level of care, may consider calling out to floor if
   agitation can be managed.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall. He underwent an evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to his inability to wean off the ventilator. A tracheostomy was performed. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate in the 140s-150s bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/95 mmHg to 108/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and prolonged PT/PTT with normal INR. The patient's blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, but sensitivity tests showed resistance to vancomycin. The patient's chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema and fluid collection.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, positive for Clostridium difficile ("

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Fevers: MRSA in sputum and now acinitobacter.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim test was
   appropriate response.  Subclavian line changed, tip culture with no
   growth.  Was afebrile for several days and then spiked fever again on
   [**12-30**] which we are attributing to CDiff infection.  Patient started on
   treatment for CDiff on [**12-31**].  Now afebrile since [**1-1**] at 4am.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - need to repeat sputum culture b/c last 2 contaminated
   - continue to follow cultures
   #2 Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with Hx of PNA, pulmonary edema,
   fluid collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a
   central process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus w/no
   sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum sample from the same day
   showed S. Aureus sensitive to Vanco, Gent, Tetracycline, and Bactrim.
   Had one episode of respiratory distress last night due to mechanical
   obstruction after which he had to be put back on the vent overnight.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above.
   - trach mask today as tolerated with PS if needed
   - stop Lasix gtt today and continue to assess fluid status
   - Nebs and suctioning
   #3 Mental status/agitation: likely multifactorial including
   medications, subdurals, infection, long stay in ICU -> delirium.
   Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any
   organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy
   of both cortical and subcortical structures which may be due to
   increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity.
   MS improving as sedation is weaned, although he has been very agitated
   over the last 48 hours.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych
   recommended d/c seroquel and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Patient required quite a bit of PRN Haldol and Ativan last night for
   agitation.  Because patient has been on high doses of several
   benzodiazepines, it is likely that 0.5mg Ativan [**Hospital1 **] is not enough to
   adequately wean her off of benzodiazepines.
   - Change Ativan to Valium 10mg PO TID w/Valium 5mg PO PRN.
   - Increase Haldol to 5mg TID
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  Likely from agitation as pt
   has been responsive with ativan, however over the last 48 hours the
   patient has been persistently more tachycardic (130
 140
s) than has
   been over the last few weeks. EKG shows sinus rhythm.  Concern for PE.
   Will need to discuss with neuro whether patient is anticoagulation
   candidate given recent subdurals.  Have checked TSH recently, was
   slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due to
   hyperthyroidism).
   - CTA to r/o PE
   - B/L LE U/S to r/o DVT
   - Monitor on tele
   - metroprolol dose to 75mg TID
   #  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: On tube feeds to goal. Continue insulin SS for glycemic control,
   monitor blood sugars.  PEG in AM, NPO after midnight.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**]
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU level of care, may consider calling out to floor if
   agitation can be managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who was admitted to the ICU due to a fall resulting in bilateral subdural hematomas. The patient's hospitalization has been complicated by a tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas and was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status. A tracheostomy was performed due to the inability to wean from the ventilator, and sedation was required.

Medical Complications:

1. Fevers: The patient had fevers initially attributed to MRSA in the sputum and Acinetobacter infection. The subclavian line was changed, and the tip culture showed no growth. The patient was afebrile for several days before experiencing another spike in fever on 12/30, which was attributed to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient was started on treatment for C. diff on 12/31 and has been afebrile since 1/1 at 4am. The patient will be treated with Linezolid for 21 days, Meropenem for 14 days, and IV Flagyl and PO Vanc for 2 weeks after stopping other antibiotics.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male admit with bilteral SDH and now with prolonged hospital
   course complicated by intermittent delirium and persistent respiratory
   failure which has been attributable to volume overload, mental status
   and persistent secretions all of which have improved to the point of
   patient tolerating trach mask trials.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with CT scan showing only bilateral lower
   lobe consolidations consistent with collapse.  He has good tolerance of
   the trach mask trials at this time and would expect continued
   mobilization to be optimal treatment to work towards lung recruitment.
   -OOB to chair if possible
   -Suction PRN
   -Will continue to support with O2 as possible.
   -Linezolid and  Meropenem to continue
   2)Altered Mental Status-He has had substantial improvement in mental
   status over time although intermittent agitation still seen.
   -Continue with Haldol
   -Wean Benzo's as possible as there still may be a component of
   paradoxical reaction
   3)Tachycardia-Source remains to be definatively defined but this may be
   a marker of continued anxiety/agitation and PE has been ruled out.
   -Trial bolus sedation to monitor response
   -[**Month (only) 8**] need to consider background beta blocker if persistently seen to
   be fast
   -This would be beta blocker use for control of hypertension and will
   need to increase dose
   -Will check ECHO to eval baseline cardiac function as impaired stroke
   volume may be contributing.
   Additional Active issues to be addressed as per the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with bilateral subdural hematomas and has had a prolonged hospital course. The patient's health progress includes intermittent delirium, persistent respiratory failure, and volume overload. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/88 mmHg to 157/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals dullness and diminished breath sounds in the chest, decreased peripheral pulses in the extremities, and no skin or neurologic assessments performed. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit and platelet count, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, altered mental status, and tachycardia. The assessment and plan include continued mobilization to work towards lung recruitment, suctioning as needed, and support with oxygen. The patient will continue to receive linezolid and meropenem antibiotics. For altered mental status, the plan is to continue with haloperidol and wean benzodiazepines as possible. Tachycardia source remains undetermined, but trial bolus sedation will be monitored, and consideration"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with Hx of PNA, pulmonary edema,
   fluid collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a
   central process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus w/no
   sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum sample from the same day
   showed S. Aureus sensitive to Vanco, Gent, Tetracycline, and Bactrim.
   Had one episode of respiratory distress last night due to mechanical
   obstruction after which he had to be put back on the vent overnight.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above.
   - trach mask today as tolerated
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   .
   #2. C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: likely multifactorial including
   medications, subdurals, infection, long stay in ICU -> delirium.
   Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any
   organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy
   of both cortical and subcortical structures which may be due to
   increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity.
   MS improving as sedation is weaned, although he has been very agitated
   over the last 48 hours.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych
   recommended d/c seroquel and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   which has not been sufficient.  Started Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN
   and increased Haldol to 5mg IV TID.  This regimen seems to be working.
   - continue Haldol 5mg IV TID, Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Concern for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
   -check echo today
   - continue with Metoprolol 75mg PO TID for now and will reassess after
   echo
   #  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: NPO for now, plan for PEG today per surgery
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, chlorhexidine mouth care, Ranitidine,
   bowel regimen.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**].
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU level of care, may consider calling out to floor if
   agitation can be managed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall and subsequently developed bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he had complications such as tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS). A tracheostomy was performed due to his inability to wean from the ventilator and sedation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including a previous pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed Staphylococcus aureus with no sensitivities, while an endotracheal sputum sample from the same day showed S. aureus sensitive to Vancomycin, Gentamicin, Tetracycline, and Bactrim. The patient had one episode of respiratory distress last night due to mechanical obstruction and was put back on the ventilator overnight. The plan is to continue linezolid and meropenem as above, use a tracheostomy mask today as tolerated, administer nebulizers and suctioning, and treat for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) for 2 weeks after"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with Hx of PNA, pulmonary edema,
   fluid collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a
   central process given the head bleed. BAL showed Staph Aureus w/no
   sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum sample from the same day
   showed S. Aureus sensitive to Vanco, Gent, Tetracycline, and Bactrim.
   Had one episode of respiratory distress two nights due to mechanical
   obstruction after which he had to be put back on the vent overnight but
   has been on trach mask now for >24h and has done well
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask today as tolerated
   - Nebs and suctioning
   - speech and swallow to assess today for tracheostomy cap to allow for
   speaking.
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   Re-dosed yesterday for patient
s body habitus.
   .
   #2. C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: likely multifactorial including
   medications, subdurals, infection, long stay in ICU -> delirium.
   Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any
   organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy
   of both cortical and subcortical structures which may be due to
   increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity.
   MS improving as sedation is weaned, and he appears to be less agitated
   today.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych recommended d/c seroquel
   and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] which has not been
   sufficient.  Started Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN and increased
   Haldol to 5mg IV TID 2 days ago.  This regimen seems to be working.
   - continue Haldol 5mg IV TID, But wean Valium to 10mg TID. Will taper
   to [**Hospital1 **] in 48h, then 5BID in 48h after that.
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still in 150
 160
s, w/out patient being agitated.
   - cardiology consulted, to see patient
   - d/c albuterol, give xopenex instead.
   #  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT to see today (consult placed)
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: d/w surgery, OK to use PEG for feeds.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppxRanitidine, bowel regimen.  chlorhexidine
   d/c.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**].

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male admit with bilteral sub-dural hematoma now with encouraging
   wean in sedation, wean in need for ventilatory support but with
   persistent tachycardia and absence of findings on CTA for PE or recent
   ECHO to explain a persistnet tachycardia.  He, however has continued
   improvement in mental status as sedation is weaned.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue trach mask
   -Move to speech and swallow evaluation for PMV trial
   -O2 as needed
   2)Tachycardia-
   -Likely has an atrial tachycardia given persistent tachycardia and
   intermittent change in p-wave morphology  with episodes of sustained
   elevation in heart rate
   -PE negative on CTA, ECHO without cardiac dysfunction
   -Increase Dilt to 90mg qid
   3)VAP
   -Linezolid and Meropenem to continue
   -Low grade fevers improving
   3)Altered Mental Status
   -Will continue to wean IV sedation to off
   -PRN bolus dosing as needed
   Additional issues to be defined and treated as described in housestaff
   note of this date.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with bilateral subdural hematoma. He has shown improvement in mental status as sedation is weaned. The patient continues to have respiratory failure, persistent tachycardia, and an atrial tachycardia likely due to an atrial tachycardia. He also has VAP and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure:
- The patient is still on tracheal mask ventilation and may require speech and swallow evaluation for potential extubation trial.
- Oxygen supplementation as needed.

2. Tachycardia:
- The patient has persistent tachycardia, likely due to atrial tachycardia.
- Increase Diltiazem dosage to 90 mg qid.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP):
- Continue Linezolid and Meropenem antibiotics.
- Low-grade fevers are improving.

4. Altered Mental Status:
- Wean off IV sedation gradually.
- PRN bolus dosing as needed.

Other potential medical complications include:
- Hematemesis (upper GI bleed, UGIB)

   sputum gram stains from [**1-3**] and [**1-5**].
   BCx [**12-28**]
 [**12-31**] final read negative

   Cath tip culture [**12-28**] negative
   CXR: free air resolved
   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Had one episode of respiratory distress
   three nights ago due to mechanical obstruction after which he had to be
   put back on the vent overnight but has been on trach mask now for >48h
   and has done well.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   Re-dosed yesterday for patient
s body habitus.
   .
   #2 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium. Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause.
   LP did not show any organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed
   severe encephalopathy of both cortical and subcortical structures which
   may be due to increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or
   seizure activity. MS improving as sedation is weaned, and he appears to
   be less agitated today.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych
   recommended d/c seroquel and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   which has not been sufficient.  Started Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN
   and increased Haldol to 5mg IV TID 2 days ago.  This regimen seems to
   be working.
   - continue Haldol 5mg IV TID, But wean Valium to 10mg TID. Will taper
   to [**Hospital1 **] in 48h, then 5BID in 48h after that.
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still was still in 150
 160
s, w/out patient being
   agitated, so cardiology was consulted.
   - cardiology consulted, on Dilt 60mg QID and Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   -> increase Metoprolol to 62.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Will continue to uptitrate for
   normal rate as BP tolerates.
   - albuterol d/c
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT was to see yesterday (consult placed) but no note in chart or
   OMR.
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: PEG for tube feeds.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**].
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU level of care, may consider calling out to floor once
   tachycardia can be managed.  CM attempting to place: may have bed
   available at [**Hospital1 2791**]?

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Multifactorial causes such as pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or central process have been identified. The patient's condition has been continually improving, but they still require tracheostomy and tracheal mask ventilation.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient tested positive for C. diff on [**12-30**]. Treatment with IV Flagyl and PO Vanc has been initiated for a duration of two weeks after other antibiotics are stopped.

3. Mental status/Agitation: The patient has been experiencing agitation, likely multifactorial including medications, subdural hematomas, infection, and prolonged ICU stay leading to delirium. Neurology does not believe seizures are the cause. LP did not show any organisms or suggest meningitis. EEG showed severe encephalopathy. The patient's mental status is improving as sedation is weaned, and they appear less agitated today. Repeat head CT shows no change. Psych recommended discontinuing Seroquel and using Haldol and Ativan. Valium is being tapered.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which may be related to infection/fevers, central process,"

   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: likely multifactorial including
   medications, subdurals, infection, long stay in ICU -> delirium.
   Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause. LP did not show any
   organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed severe encephalopathy
   of both cortical and subcortical structures which may be due to
   increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or seizure activity.
   MS improving as sedation is weaned, and he appears to be less agitated
   today.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych recommended d/c seroquel
   and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] which has not been
   sufficient.  Started Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN and increased
   Haldol to 5mg IV TID 2 days ago.  This regimen seems to be working.
   - continue Haldol 5mg IV TID, But wean Valium to 10mg TID. Will taper
   to [**Hospital1 **] in 48h, then 5BID in 48h after that.
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still in 150

   - cardiology consulted, to see patient
   - d/c albuterol, give xopenex instead.
   #  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas following a fall. His hospitalization has been complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure but was recently placed on a tracheostomy and is now breathing spontaneously with the support of a trach mask. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 121/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's blood cultures showed Staphylococcus aureus, but endotracheal sputum sample showed sensitivity to vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and bactrim.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory failure: Multifactorial with history of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL showed"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Had one episode of respiratory distress
   three nights ago due to mechanical obstruction after which he had to be
   put back on the vent overnight but has been on trach mask now for >48h
   and has done well.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   Re-dosed yesterday for patient
s body habitus.
   .
   #2 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium. Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause.
   LP did not show any organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed
   severe encephalopathy of both cortical and subcortical structures which
   may be due to increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or
   seizure activity. MS improving as sedation is weaned, and he appears to
   be less agitated today.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych
   recommended d/c seroquel and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   which has not been sufficient.  Started Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN
   and increased Haldol to 5mg IV TID 2 days ago.  This regimen seems to
   be working.
   - continue Haldol 5mg IV TID, But wean Valium to 10mg TID. Will taper
   to [**Hospital1 **] in 48h, then 5BID in 48h after that.
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still was still in 150
 160
s, w/out patient being
   agitated, so cardiology was consulted.
   - cardiology consulted, on Dilt 60mg QID and Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   -> increase Metoprolol to 62.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Will continue to uptitrate for
   normal rate as BP tolerates.
   - albuterol d/c
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT was to see yesterday (consult placed) but no note in chart or
   OMR.
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: PEG for tube feeds.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: R subclavian inserted [**2156-12-28**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. During hospitalization, he experienced complications such as tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status. A tracheostomy was performed due to the inability to wean from the ventilator, and sedation was administered.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure. It is improving but still requires continued support with a tracheostomy and Nebulized bronchodilators.
2. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection: The patient tested positive for C. Diff on [**12-30**]. He is being treated with both IV Flagyl and PO Vanc for a duration of two weeks after stopping other antibiotics.
3. Mental Status/Agitation: The patient's mental status and agitation are likely multifactorial, including medications, subdural hematomas, infection, and prolonged ICU stay leading to delirium. Neurology does not believe seizures are the cause. A lumbar puncture showed no organisms or signs of meningitis, and an EEG showed severe encephalopathy. The patient's agitation has improved as sedation is weaned"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, who was admitted for evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. The hospitalization has been complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS). He underwent tracheostomy due to inability to wean from the ventilator and sedation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure, including pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, and possibly secondary to AMS or a central process. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed Staphylococcus aureus with no sensitivities, while an endotracheal sputum sample from the same day showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sensitive to vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and Bactrim. The patient had one episode of respiratory distress due to mechanical obstruction and had to be put back on the ventilator overnight but has been on tracheostomy mask for over 48 hours and has done well.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) Infection: The patient tested positive for C. Diff on [**12-30**]. He is being treated with IV Flagyl for 2 weeks after other antibiotics are stopped, and PO Vanc for C. Diff starting on [**12-31**] for 2 weeks after other antibiotics are stopped.

3. Mental Status/Agitation: The patient's mental status and agitation are improving but are likely multifactorial, including medications, subdural hematomas, infection, and long ICU stay leading to delirium. Neurology does not feel seizures are likely the cause. A lumbar puncture (LP) did not show any organisms or suggest meningitis. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed severe encephalopathy of both cortical and subcortical structures, which may be due to increased intracranial pressure, without focal deficits or seizure activity. The repeat head CT shows no change. Psychiatry recommended discontinuing Seroquel and using Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1**], which has not been sufficient. The patient was started on Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN and increased Haldol to 5mg IV TID 2 days ago. This regimen seems to be working.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to infection/fevers but could also be from a central process, agitation, or pain. An EKG shows sinus rhythm. Lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) and computed tomography angiogram (CTA) without pulmonary embolism (PE) were performed, ruling out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE. The tachycardia did not respond to Valium, Haldol, or Lopressor. TSH was recently checked and was slightly elevated, making hyperthyroidism an unlikely cause. A repeat echocardiogram (ECHO) was normal. The patient was switched from metoprolol to diltiazem 60mg QID, which did not improve the tachycardia, so the dose was increased to 90mg QID without improvement. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was started on diltiazem 60mg QID and metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1**] today, with an increase in metoprolol to 62.5mg [**Hospital1**]. The plan is to continue uptitrating metoprolol for a normal heart rate as tolerated.

5. Subdural Hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow the patient's subdural hematomas. They appear improved/stable from prior imaging.

Potential Medical Complications:
- The patient's history of hypertension and hypothyroidism may contribute to the current medical complications.
- There is a risk of developing further infections due to the prolonged ICU stay and use of indwelling medical devices.
- The patient's renal function should be monitored closely due to the use of multiple nephrotoxic medications.
- The patient's mental status and agitation may continue to fluctuate, requiring close monitoring and adjustment of sedation and delirium management strategies.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Had one episode of respiratory distress
   three nights ago due to mechanical obstruction after which he had to be
   put back on the vent overnight but has been on trach mask now for >48h
   and has done well.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   - Linezolid X 21 days (start date = [**12-22**], end date = [**1-12**])
   - Meropenem to cover acinitobacter, VAP and possible pseudomonas (start
   date = [**12-29**], 14 day course
 start date based on when patient was
   afebrile before fever spiked again but presumed due to Cdiff).
   Re-dosed yesterday for patient
s body habitus.
   .
   #2 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium. Neurology does not feel seizures are likely cause.
   LP did not show any organisms or suggest any meningitis.  EEG showed
   severe encephalopathy of both cortical and subcortical structures which
   may be due to increased intracranial pressure, no focal deficits or
   seizure activity. MS improving as sedation is weaned, and he appears to
   be less agitated today.  Repeat head CT shows no change.  Psych
   recommended d/c seroquel and use Haldol 2.5mg TID and Ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   which has not been sufficient.  Started Valium 10mg PO TID with 5mg PRN
   and increased Haldol to 5mg IV TID 2 days ago.  This regimen seems to
   be working.
   - continue Haldol 5mg IV TID, But wean Valium to 10mg TID. Will taper
   to [**Hospital1 **] in 48h, then 5BID in 48h after that.
   - will wean Fentanyl 20% per day
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still was still in 150
 160
s, w/out patient being
   agitated, so cardiology was consulted.
   - cardiology consulted, on Dilt 60mg QID and Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   -> increase Metoprolol to 62.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Will continue to uptitrate for
   normal rate as BP tolerates.
   - albuterol d/c
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT was to see yesterday (consult placed) but no note in chart or

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who has been hospitalized for several complications including tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is continually improving but is multifactorial with a history of pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed Staphylococcus aureus with no sensitivities, while an endotracheal sputum sample from the same day showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sensitive to vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and Bactrim. The patient had one episode of respiratory distress due to mechanical obstruction and required reintubation but has been on a tracheostomy mask for over 48 hours and is doing well.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection: The patient tested positive for C. Diff on [12-30]. Treatment includes IV Flagyl for 2 weeks after other antibiotics are stopped and PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [12-31"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Had one episode of respiratory distress
   three nights ago due to mechanical obstruction after which he had to be
   put back on the vent overnight but has been on trach mask now for >48h
   and has done well.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   .
   #2 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium.
   - Fentanyl weaned off today
   - Haldol 5mg PO BID today
   - Valium 10mg PO BID today
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still was still in 150
 160
s, w/out patient being
   agitated, so cardiology was consulted.
   - cardiology consulted, on Dilt 60mg QID and Metoprolol 75mg PO TID
   - albuterol d/c
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT to see
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: PEG for tube feeds.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: PICC line. Subclavian pulled.
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo:.  CM attempting to place: may have bed available at [**Hospital1 2791**]?

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Had one episode of respiratory distress
   three nights ago due to mechanical obstruction after which he had to be
   put back on the vent overnight but has been on trach mask now for >48h
   and has done well.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   .
   #2 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium.
   - Fentanyl weaned off today
   - Haldol 5mg PO BID today
   - Valium 10mg PO BID today
   - psychiatry to follow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium, Haldol or Lopressor.  Have checked
   TSH recently, was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due
   to hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still was still in 150
 160
s, w/out patient being
   agitated, so cardiology was consulted.
   - cardiology consulted, on Dilt 60mg QID and Metoprolol 75mg PO TID
   - albuterol d/c
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT to see
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: PEG for tube feeds.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: PICC line. Subclavian pulled.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who was admitted to the hospital after a fall resulting in bilateral subdural hematomas.
- During hospitalization, the patient experienced complications including tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure.
- The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS).
- A tracheostomy was performed due to the inability to wean from the ventilator, and the patient has been on a tracheostomy for over 48 hours without any significant issues.
- The patient's respiratory failure is improving, but it is multifactorial, including a previous pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process.
- The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection and will be treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vanc for two weeks after stopping other antibiotics.
- The patient's mental status and agitation are also improving but are likely multifactorial, including medications, subdurals, infection, and long ICU stay leading to delirium.
- The patient's persistent tachycardia is likely related to infection/fevers but could also be due to a central process, agitation,"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Had one episode of respiratory distress
   three nights ago due to mechanical obstruction after which he had to be
   put back on the vent overnight but has been on trach mask now for >48h
   and has done well.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   .
   #2 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium.  Fentanyl and versed weaned off.  Appreciate recs
   from psychiatry.
   - stop valium as likely stored in fat and will self-taper per psych
   recs
   - ativan prn per psych
   - Haldol 5mg PO BID today, will taper tomorrow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium or haldol.  Have checked TSH recently,
   was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due to
   hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still was still in 150
 160
s, w/out patient being
   agitated, so cardiology was consulted.
   - cardiology consulted, on Dilt 60mg QID and Metoprolol 75mg PO TID
   - albuterol d/c
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT to see
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: tube feeds via PEG.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: PICC line. Subclavian pulled.
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: patient is being screened for rehab.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall and subsequently underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS). 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including respiratory failure, Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection, mental status/agitation, tachycardia, subdural hematomas, hypothyroidism, and a previous history of pneumonia (PNA). 

For respiratory failure, the patient is currently on a tracheostomy, nebulizer treatments (changed to Xopenex), and suctioning. He is also receiving antibiotics (linezolid and meropenem) for both MRSA and other possible infections. 

For C. Diff infection, the patient is being treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vanc for two weeks after stopping other antibiotics. 

The mental status/agitation is being managed by weaning off fentanyl and versed, stopping valium, and using ativan as needed per psychiatric recommendations. 

Tachycardia is being addressed with a combination of diltiazem and metoprolol as prescribed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU with bilateral subdural hematomas (SDH) requiring tracheostomy due to respiratory failure. He was initially on the neurosurgery service but was transferred to the ICU for persistent fevers and inability to wean from mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA and Acinetobacter pneumonia, as well as Clostridium difficile colitis. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 144/64 to 166/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 105.3 kg, and his height is 67 inches. He has received various medications including linezolid, meropenem, metronidazole, heparin sodium, levoxyl, keppra, vancomycin orally, diltiazem, valium, and haldol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth. The flow sheet data shows fluid balance, vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and other parameters. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactate levels, along with low platelet count and magnesium level. The patient's arterial blood gas values show a pH of 7"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   .
   #1 Elevated WBCs: pt afebrile, possibly infectious but may be
   inflammation, lab variation.
   - will hold on infectious workup and check differential first.  If
   patient becomes febrile or other signs of infection, will consider
   reculturing
   - continue to monitor
   #2 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Doing well on trach  mask for several days
   without need for ventilator.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   .
   #3 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped, end date = [**2157-1-25**]
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped, end date = [**2157-1-25**]
   #4 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium.  Fentanyl and versed weaned off.  Appreciate recs
   from psychiatry.
   - Valium stopped.  Pt written for ativan PRN but has not needed any
   - will change Haldol to PRN and stop standing Haldol
   .
   #5 Tachycardia: Per cardiology, this is an atrial tachycardia with some
   MAT.  Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID from metoprolol w/out improvement.
   Tolerating Metoprolol 75mg PO TID and Diltiazem 60mg PO QID.
   - continue current regimen, consider changing to long-acting but
   unclear if this can be crushed into PEG tube.  Will discuss with
   pharmacy.
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT to see
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: tube feeds via PEG.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: PICC line. Subclavian pulled.
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: patient is being screened for rehab.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. The patient underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas following a fall. Since hospitalization, the patient has experienced complications such as tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. The patient was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS). A tracheostomy was performed due to the inability to wean from the ventilator, and sedation was administered.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Elevated WBCs: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. However, it could also be a result of inflammation or laboratory variation. The physician has decided to hold on infectious workup and check the differential first. If the patient becomes febrile or shows other signs of infection, the physician will consider reculturing.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, but it has been continually improving. This multifactorial issue is attributed to a history of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process due to the head bleed. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed Staphylococcus aureus with no sensitivities, although an endotracheal sputum sample from the same"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Had one episode of respiratory distress
   three nights ago due to mechanical obstruction after which he had to be
   put back on the vent overnight but has been on trach mask now for >48h
   and has done well.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   .
   #2 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped
   #3 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium.  Fentanyl and versed weaned off.  Appreciate recs
   from psychiatry.
   - stop valium as likely stored in fat and will self-taper per psych
   recs
   - ativan prn per psych
   - Haldol 5mg PO BID today, will taper tomorrow
   .
   #4 Tachycardia: likely related to infection/fevers but could also be
   from a central process, agitation or pain.  EKG shows sinus rhythm.
   LENIs show no DVT, CTA without PE.  Not clearly due to pain or
   agitation, no response to Valium or haldol.  Have checked TSH recently,
   was slightly elevated (unlikely that tachycardia is due to
   hyperthyroidism).  Repeat ECHO normal. Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID
   from metoprolol w/out improvement. Increased diltiazem to 90 QID w/out
   improvement, HR still was still in 150
 160
s, w/out patient being
   agitated, so cardiology was consulted.
   - cardiology consulted, on Dilt 60mg QID and Metoprolol 75mg PO TID
   - albuterol d/c
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT to see
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: tube feeds via PEG.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: PICC line. Subclavian pulled.
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: patient is being screened for rehab.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism who has been hospitalized due to complications from a fall, including tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status. The patient underwent tracheostomy for his inability to wean off the ventilator and sedation.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, C. difficile infection, mental status/agitation, tachycardia, subdural hematomas, hypothyroidism, and potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/56 to 153/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on tracheostomy mask.

The patient's recent lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there is an elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and a slightly low potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

Plan:
- Continue linezolid and meropenem as above until [**1-12**].

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   .
   #1 Elevated WBCs: pt afebrile, possibly infectious but may be
   inflammation, lab variation.
   - will hold on infectious workup and check differential first.  If
   patient becomes febrile or other signs of infection, will consider
   reculturing
   - continue to monitor
   #2 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Doing well on trach  mask for several days
   without need for ventilator.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   .
   #3 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped, end date = [**2157-1-25**]
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped, end date = [**2157-1-25**]
   #4 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium.  Fentanyl and versed weaned off.  Appreciate recs
   from psychiatry.
   - Valium stopped.  Pt written for ativan PRN but has not needed any
   - will change Haldol to PRN and stop standing Haldol
   .
   #5 Tachycardia: Per cardiology, this is an atrial tachycardia with some
   MAT.  Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID from metoprolol w/out improvement.
    Tolerating Metoprolol 75mg PO TID and Diltiazem 60mg PO QID.
   - continue current regimen, consider changing to long-acting but
   unclear if this can be crushed into PEG tube.  Will discuss with
   pharmacy.
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT to see
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: tube feeds via PEG.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: PICC line. Subclavian pulled.
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: patient is being screened for rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall, resulting in bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed a tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status (AMS). A tracheostomy was performed due to his inability to wean from the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Elevated WBCs: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection. However, it could also be a result of inflammation or laboratory variation. Further monitoring is recommended, and if the patient becomes febrile or shows signs of infection, reculturing may be necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving, but it is multifactorial, including a history of pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, and possibly secondary to altered mental status or a central process due to the head bleed. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed Staphylococcus aureus with no sensitivities, while an endotracheal sputum sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vancomycin, Gentamicin, Tetracycline, and Bactrim. The patient is doing well on"

   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   #1 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Doing well on trach  mask for several days
   without need for ventilator.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date today
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   .
   #2 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium.  Fentanyl and versed weaned off.  Appreciate recs
   from psychiatry.  Valium stopped.  Pt written for ativan PRN but has
   not needed any.  Standing Haldol d/c, PRN only. Patient continues to
   improve.
   .
   #3 Tachycardia: Per cardiology, this is an atrial tachycardia with some
   MAT.  Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID from metoprolol w/out improvement.
   Tolerating Metoprolol 75mg PO TID and Diltiazem 60mg PO QID.
   -          continue current regimen
   .
   #4  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging. Evaluated by PT/OT.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a fall and underwent evacuation of bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed complications such as tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to the MICU service for further evaluation of persistent fevers and altered mental status. A tracheostomy was performed due to his inability to wean from the ventilator.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown improvement but remains on a tracheostomy mask. His respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process related to the head bleed. The patient's BAL showed Staphylococcus aureus with no sensitivities, while an endotracheal sputum sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vancomycin, Gentamicin, Tetracycline, and Bactrim.

2. Mental status/agitation: The patient's mental status is also improving, likely due to multifactorial causes including medications, subdural hematomas, infection, and prolonged ICU stay leading to delirium. Medications such as fentanyl andversed have been weaned off, and haldol has been discontinued except for prn use. The patient continues to improve.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia with some MAT. Cardiology suggests continuing the current regimen of metoprolol and diltiazem.

4. Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow the patient's condition. The hematomas appear improved/stable from prior imaging.

5. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection: The patient tested positive for C. Diff and is being treated with both IV and PO antibiotics for two weeks after other antibiotics are stopped.

6. Hypothyroidism: The patient is to continue taking levothyroxine.

7. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid intake and output are being monitored and maintained.

8. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's disposition is to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility for further care.

Please note that this summary provides an overview of the patient's conditions and potential medical complications based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare team for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism who is s/p evacuation of
   bilateral subdural hematomas after a fall. Hospitalization has been
   complicated by tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistant tachycardia and
   respiratory failure.  Transferred to the MICU service, in order to
   further evaluate persistent fevers and AMS. Tracheostomy for inability
   to wean from ventilator, sedation.
   .
   #1 Elevated WBCs: pt afebrile, possibly infectious but may be
   inflammation, lab variation.
   - will hold on infectious workup and check differential first.  If
   patient becomes febrile or other signs of infection, will consider
   reculturing
   - continue to monitor
   #2 Respiratory failure: Continually improving. Multifactorial with Hx
   of PNA, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, also secondary to altered
   mental status or even a central process given the head bleed. BAL
   showed Staph Aureus w/no sensitivities, although endotracheal sputum
   sample from the same day showed MRSA sensitive to Vanco, Gent,
   Tetracycline, and Bactrim.  Doing well on trach  mask for several days
   without need for ventilator.
   - continue linezolid and meropenem as above w/end date [**1-12**]
   - trach mask
   - Nebs (changed to xopenex) and suctioning
   - PMV prn
   .
   #3 C. Diff positive from [**12-30**]
   - IV Flagyl for C. Diff, day #1 = [**12-28**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped, end date = [**2157-1-25**]
   - PO Vanc for C. Diff day #1 = [**12-31**]
 will treat for 2 weeks after
   other abxs stopped, end date = [**2157-1-25**]
   #4 Mental status/agitation: Continually improving.  Likely
   multifactorial including medications, subdurals, infection, long stay
   in ICU -> delirium.  Fentanyl and versed weaned off.  Appreciate recs
   from psychiatry.
   - Valium stopped.  Pt written for ativan PRN but has not needed any
   - will change Haldol to PRN and stop standing Haldol
   .
   #5 Tachycardia: Per cardiology, this is an atrial tachycardia with some
   MAT.  Changed to diltiazem 60mg QID from metoprolol w/out improvement.
   Tolerating Metoprolol 75mg PO TID and Diltiazem 60mg PO QID.
   - continue current regimen, consider changing to long-acting but
   unclear if this can be crushed into PEG tube.  Will discuss with
   pharmacy.
   #5  Subdural hematomas: Neurosurgery will continue to follow.  Appear
   improved/stable from prior imaging.
   - Continue Keppra for seizure ppx
   - PT/OT to see
   #  Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine.
   # F: attempt to maintain fluids even today.
      E: Replete PRN
      N: tube feeds via PEG.
   # PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT, ppx Ranitidine, bowel regimen.
   # Access: PICC line. Subclavian pulled.
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: patient is being screened for rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall, which resulted in bilateral subdural hematomas. During his hospitalization, he developed a tension pneumothorax, fevers, persistent tachycardia, and respiratory failure. He underwent a tracheostomy due to his inability to wean from the ventilator and is currently on sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Elevated WBCs: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this is due to an infectious cause or lab variation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving but remains a concern. It is multifactorial, with possible contributions from previous pneumonia, pulmonary edema, fluid collection, altered mental status, or a central process related to the head bleed. The patient is currently doing well on tracheostomy mask and may no longer require ventilator support.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) Infection: The patient tested positive for C. Diff. He is being treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vanc for a duration of two weeks after stopping other antibiotics.

4. Mental Status/Agitation: The patient's mental status and agitation are improving but remain a concern. Factors contributing to these symptoms may include medications, subdural hematom"
