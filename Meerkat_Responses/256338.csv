","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD (liver transplant), and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture. He was transferred to the hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.

The patient has grown GNR (gram-negative rods) from his blood cultures, along with acinetobacter from sinuses and endotracheal swabs. This new bacteremia occurred despite the use of amikacin, which should have provided good gram-negative coverage. Imaging at OSH (other hospital) was unrevealing, and no lumbar puncture (LP) was performed prior to antibiotics.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 118/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.

Physical examination findings include openings eyes to voice, does not follow commands, oriented x 0, sclera anicteric, MM dry, tracheostomy site intact, cervical collar in place, pupils reactive, coarse breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes, ronchi, rales, soft and mildly distended abdomen, G-tube site intact, grimaces to palpation in right lower quadrant, + BS, no"

 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3955**] is a 55 year old male with hypertension, type II diabetes,
   alcohol abuse, ESLD s/p orthotopic liver transplant in 6/00, and severe
   motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and subsequent
   tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [**8-/2145**] who is transferred to our
   hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.
   Fever: Enterobacter sensitive to Meropenem from his blood from cultures
   taken [**11-30**].  Band count of 25% on the day of transfer.  Potential
   sources include urinary tract, abdomen vs. Cervical hard [**Location (un) **].  Repeat
   CT abd without e/o infection. XRAY of foot without evidence of osteo.
   - f/u repeat cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool for c. diff)
   - foley catheter changed
   - right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess for portal flow
   - consider neck CT with contrast given known hardware
   - Narrow coverage to meropenem given sensitivities from [**Hospital3 364**]
   - ID following
   - will hold all neuroleptics as potential cause of non-infectious
   fevers
   Elevated Creatinine:  Per [**Hospital3 364**] records, Cr was 1.4 on [**11-26**],
   spiked up to 2.3 on [**11-30**].  Currently 1.2 and trending down.
   - Likely can get neck CT with contrast today
   - Hydrate well prior to contrast
   - attempt to avoid nephrotoxic agents (closely monitor aminoglycosides)
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Unclear if patient has shown potential to
   wean.  Currently on assist control.  Given mental status and current
   infection will not attempt to wean at present.
   - continue assist control
   Encephalopathy:  Patient with depressed mental status since motor
   vehicle accident with no clear cause.  At OSH was on lactulose and
   haldol along with oxycodone and morphine.  He has had EEGs with
   evidence of severe encephalopathy most recently [**11-24**].
   - hold lactulose
   - hold haldol
   - holding oxycodone and morphine
   - cautious fentanyl if evidence of discomfort
   ESLD s/p liver transplant [**6-/2137**].  Liver team aware.  Will see in AM.
   Would like to obtain pathology reports and possibly slides from biopsy
   in [**9-13**].  INR 1.1, albumin 2.3,
   - continue prograf
   - check prograf levels
   - liver team to see today
   Tachycardia:  Likely secondary to known infection, discomfort.
   - fentanyl for discomfort
   - for now will not use beta blockers
   Type II Diabetes:
   - continue lantus 28 U
   - continue sliding scale
   Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently stable.  Not on any agents.
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD post orthotopic liver transplant in 2000, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture, was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. He has been experiencing fevers, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's large closed wound on the right lateral foot with possible necrosis indicates impaired skin integrity, which can lead to infection or further tissue damage.
2. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient is on assist control ventilation due to chronic respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging given the patient's current infection and mental status.
3. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO, Hypothermia, Pyrexia): The patient has been experiencing fevers of unknown origin, with Enterobacter sensitive to Meropenem found in his blood cultures. Potential sources include the urinary tract, abdomen, or cervical area. Repeat cultures are needed to identify the exact source of infection.
4. Elevated Creatinine: The patient's creatinine levels have been fluctuating, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of kidney function and avoiding nephrotoxic agents are necessary.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient has a depressed mental status since the motor vehicle accident, with EEGs showing severe encephalopathy. Holding neurole"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of liver transplant, MVC, cervical fracture, and multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He remains unresponsive since the MVC and is vent-dependent. He has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has been febrile since admission. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on mechanical ventilation. His extremities are absent, and there is a question of ecchymosis versus necrosis on the right foot, with ulcers on the left foot. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine level, and altered liver function tests. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including meropenem, tobramycin, and vancomycin. He is currently being treated for fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures indicate a possible bacterial infection. This could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is vent-dependent and has chronic respiratory failure. This means"

   Assessment: Mr. [**Known lastname 3955**] is a 55 year old male with hypertension, type II
   diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD s/p orthotopic liver transplant in 6/00,
   and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and
   subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [**8-/2145**] who is
   transferred to our hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   Fever:  Etiology of fevers is unclear.  Currently growing gram negative
   rods from his blood from cultures taken [**11-30**].  Band count of 25% on
   the day of transfer.  Potential etiologies include urinary tract,
   biliary system/abdomen vs. lungs.  Of concern patient has also grown
   acinetobacter from sinuses and endotracheal swabs and this new
   bacteremia has occurred in the setting of amikacin use which should
   have good gram negative coverage. Imaging so far has been unrevealing
   and has included abdominal CT without contrast, head CT (sinus disease)
   and chest CT.  No LP was performed prior to antibiotics.  Gallium scan
   also not revealing. Continues to have persistent fevers.
   - repeat all cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool for c. diff)
   - change foley catheter
   - repeat CXR tonight
   - repeat abdominal CT without contrast
   - right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess for biliary duct dilitation
   - will need to discuss with [**Hospital3 364**] details of hardware from MVC
   prior to considering MRI scans
   - consider neck CT given known hardware
   - XRAY of foot given necrotic appearing ulceration
   - follow up speciation of organisim from [**Hospital3 364**]
   - for now will cover with vancomycin, meropenem and tobramycin (given
   that bacteremia developed on amikacin)
   - ID consult in AM
   - will hold all neuroleptics as potential cause of non-infectious
   fevers
   .
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Unclear if patient has shown potential to
   wean.  Currently on assist control.  Given mental status and current
   infection will not attempt to wean at present.
   - continue assist control
   .
   Encephalopathy:  Patient with depressed mental status since motor
   vehicle accident with no clear cause.  At OSH was on lactulose and
   haldol along with oxycodone and morphine.  He has had EEGs with
   evidence of severe encephalopathy most recently [**11-24**].
   - hold lactulose
   - hold haldol
   - holding oxycodone and morphine
   - cautious fentanyl if evidence of discomfort

   ESLD s/p liver transplant [**6-/2137**].  Liver team aware.  Will see in AM.
   Would like to obtain pathology reports and possibly slides from biopsy
   in [**9-13**].  INR 1.1, albumin 2.3,
   - continue prograf
   - check prograf levels
   - liver team to see in AM

   Elevated Creatinine:  Unclear baseline.  Currently 1.4.  Per notes was
   higher at OSH.
   - urine electrolytes
   - urine sediment
   - attempt to avoid nephrotoxic agents (closely monitor aminoglycosides)
   .
   Tachycardia:  Likely secondary to known infection, discomfort.
   - fentanyl for discomfort
   - for now will not use beta blockers

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD (liver transplant), and severe motor vehicle accident. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers despite being on antibiotics. Cultures have grown gram-negative rods, and the patient has also grown acinetobacter from sinuses and endotracheal swabs. Imaging studies have been unrevealing, including an abdominal CT without contrast, head CT, chest CT, and gallium scan. The patient's condition is complicated by impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, chronic fever, and encephalopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and growth of gram-negative rods in the blood cultures indicate a potential bacterial infection. The presence of acinetobacter in sinuses and endotracheal swabs suggests a possible source of infection. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to address this complication.

2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on assist control due to chronic respiratory failure. It is unclear if the patient has shown potential to wean off the ventilator. The underlying cause of the respiratory failure needs to be identified and managed appropriately.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient has a depressed mental status since the motor vehicle accident. The cause of encephalopathy is unclear, and further investigation is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD post orthotopic liver transplant, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture. He has been admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. The patient has grown gram-negative rods from his blood cultures, potentially from the urinary tract, biliary system/abdomen, or lungs. He also has acinetobacter from sinuses and endotracheal swabs. The patient's fever persists despite antibiotic use, and further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, along with the growth of gram-negative rods in his blood cultures, suggest a possible ongoing infection. If the infection is not appropriately managed, it could lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes widespread inflammation.
2. Organism Resistance: The presence of acinetobacter, which is a difficult-to-treat organism, indicates a potential risk for antibiotic resistance. This could complicate treatment options and increase the risk of treatment failure.
3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may make weaning from mechanical ventilation challenging. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia and other complications.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: As an ESLD patient, the patient is at risk for hep"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a liver transplant recipient with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been unresponsive since a motor vehicle collision (MVC) in 08/2145 and has been in the ICU.

The patient's recent medical history includes a transfer from a rehabilitation center due to fever, where an Acinetobacter and enterococcus infection was identified around a gastrostomy tube. The patient also had chest infiltrate on a CT scan, and blood cultures were positive for gram-negative rods (GNR), which were resistant to certain antibiotics but sensitive to meropenem, Zosyn, and amikacin.

In the ICU, the patient has been started on acyclovir for a suspected herpes zoster rash. The patient's ventilator mode has been changed from assist-control (A/C) to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The respiratory system is stable with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 103.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.8°F, sinus tachycardia with a heart rate between 109-126 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 65 kg, and there has been a total fluid input of 5,803 mL and output of 4"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of liver transplant, motor vehicle collision, cervical fracture, diabetes mellitus type 2, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has been unresponsive since the MVC and has shown encephalopathy on EEGs. The patient was transferred to the ICU with fever, positive blood cultures for GNR, resistant enterobacter, and chest infiltrate on CT. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, and he has been febrile with a maximum temperature of 101.8°F. He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has thin skin, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. Regular repositioning and proper skin care should be implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating chronic respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to his underlying condition and potential complications like ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO, Hypothermia, Pyrexia): The patient has persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection. Possible sources could include a central line infection, abdominal infection, or pulmonary"

 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3955**] is a 55 year old male with hypertension, type II diabetes,
   alcohol abuse, ESLD s/p orthotopic liver transplant in 6/00, and severe
   motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and subsequent
   tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [**8-/2145**] who is transferred to our
   hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.
   Fever: Enterobacter from blood CX sensitive to Meropenem and Sputum Cx
   grew MRSA [**11-30**].   Potential sources for enterobacter include urinary
   tract, abdomen vs. Cervical hard [**Location (un) **].  Repeat CT abd without e/o
   infection. XRAY of foot without evidence of osteo.  Bone scan with
   enhancement in R shoulder (known fracture) and around neck hardware.
   - f/u repeat cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool for c. diff)
   - foley catheter changed
   - Continue meropenem for GNR in blood and vanc for MRSA from [**Hospital 3956**] cultures
   - daily survaillence blood Cx
   - ID following
   - will hold all neuroleptics as potential cause of non-infectious
   fevers
   - call IP for ? tap of R pleural effusion. -> they can do it Monday
   [**2145-12-6**]
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Unclear if patient has shown potential to
   wean.  Currently on assist control.  Given mental status and current
   infection will not attempt to wean at present.
   - continue assist control
   Encephalopathy:  Patient with depressed mental status since motor
   vehicle accident with no clear cause.  At OSH was on lactulose and
   haldol along with oxycodone and morphine.  He has had EEGs with
   evidence of severe encephalopathy most recently [**11-24**].
   - hold lactulose
   - hold haldol
   - holding oxycodone and morphine
   - cautious fentanyl if evidence of discomfort
   Elevated Creatinine:  Per [**Hospital3 364**] records, Cr was 1.4 on [**11-26**],
   spiked up to 2.3 on [**11-30**].  Currently 0.9.
   - Monitor daily
   ESLD s/p liver transplant [**6-/2137**].  Liver team aware. Would like to obtain
   pathology reports and possibly slides from biopsy in [**9-13**].  INR 1.1,
   albumin 2.3,
   - continue prograf
   - check prograf levels
   - f/u liver recs
   Tachycardia:  Likely secondary to known infection, discomfort.
   - fentanyl for discomfort
   - for now will not use beta blockers
   Type II Diabetes:
   - continue lantus 28 U
   - continue sliding scale
   Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently stable.  Not on any agents.
   - continue to monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD post orthotopic liver transplant, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture. The patient was admitted for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has scattered crusted lesions on the left inguinal region, which indicates impaired skin integrity. This could be due to an infection or other causes.

2. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient is on assist control due to chronic respiratory failure. It is unclear if the patient has shown potential to wean off the ventilator support. Chronic respiratory failure can lead to further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Fever, unknown origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite multiple cultures and investigations. FUO can be caused by various infectious or non-infectious conditions and requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.

4. Enterobacter infection: The patient has a blood culture positive for Enterobacter, which is sensitive to meropenem. Enterobacter infections can be serious and require prompt antibiotic treatment.

5. MRSA infection: The patient's sputum culture grew MRSA. MRSA infections are resistant to many common antibiotics and can lead to severe complications if not treated appropriately.

6. Potential sources of infection"

The patient has been experiencing fevers, chronic respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and encephalopathy. He has a known infection with Enterobacter sensitive to Meropenem from his blood cultures taken on [11-30]. Potential sources of infection include the urinary tract, abdomen, or cervical hardware. Repeat CT abdomen without evidence of infection, X-ray of foot without evidence of osteo. The patient's elevated creatinine level is trending down, and he will be hydrated well prior to contrast for a neck CT with contrast. The patient's chronic respiratory failure will continue on assist control mode. Encephalopathy is suspected to be secondary to the motor vehicle accident, and medications such as lactulose and haldol will be held. The patient's ESLD status post liver transplant is being closely monitored, with INR at 1.1 and albumin at 2.3. Prograf levels will be checked, and liver recommendations will be followed. Tachycardia is likely due to known infection and discomfort. Fentanyl will be used"

   Assessment: Mr. [**Known lastname 3955**] is a 55 year old male with hypertension, type II
   diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD s/p orthotopic liver transplant in 6/00,
   and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and
   subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [**8-/2145**] who is
   transferred to our hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   Fever:  Presumed infectious, but unclear source as paitent has been on
   extensitve abx coverage for some time.   Imaging so far has been
   unrevealing and has included abdominal CT without contrast, head CT
   (sinus disease) and chest CT.  No LP was performed prior to
   antibiotics.  Pt is encephalopathic at baseline.  All cultures here
   without growth to date and cdif negative.  Suspectied zoster rash noted
   and pt on acyclovir.  Xray foot without evidence of osteo.  Currently
   on meropenem, but spiked through overnight.
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool for c. diff)
   - consider neck CT given known hardware
   - follow fever curve- consider additional antimicrobial coverage.
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  RSBI 103.  Was on assist control on
   admission, Now CPAP/PSV w/PS 10 cmH2O.  ABG with mild alkalosis.
   - f/u AM chest x-ray
   - continue to wean as tolerated/safe
   Encephalopathy:  Holding lactulose, hold haldol; on fentanyl for pain.
   ESLD s/p liver transplant [**6-/2137**].  Liver team has seen; appreciate recs.
   Prograf 5.7 yesterday.
   - follow daily prograf levels
   - liver team to follow
   Elevated Creatinine:  Unclear baseline.  Currently 1.4.  Per notes was
   ~2.4 at OSH so now is much improved; likely  pre-renal etiology.
   - continue to monitor
   Tachycardia:  Stable; Likely secondary to known infection, discomfort.
   - fentanyl for discomfort
   - for now will not use beta blockers

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, and ESLD who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant in 2000. He is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. The patient has impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and fever. He is also experiencing tachycardia, elevated creatinine levels, and encephalopathy. The patient has multiple medical conditions and is on various medications, including tacrolimus, vancomycin, tobramycin, acyclovir, meropenem, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to increased risk of infection, pressure ulcers, and delayed wound healing.
2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may result in respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever indicates an underlying infection or inflammation. It is important to identify the source of infection to prevent further complications.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be due to known infection or discomfort. It is necessary to monitor the heart rate and address any underlying causes promptly.
5. Elevated Creatinine Levels: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction."

   Will try patient on trach mask today. Tolerate respiratory rate up to
   35. If he becomes more tachypneic, place back on PSV for several hours
   and then try again on trach mask; use ""sprint/rest"" approach to weaning
   off ventilator.
   Still febrile although WBC normal. Continues on antibiotics for MRSA in
   sputum and gram negative rods in blood. No source of bacteremia yet
   identified. Consider gallium scan. Doubt small pleural effusion
   accounts for bactermia; will ask IP to assess for diagnostic tap under
   ultrasound guidance.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with chronic respiratory failure and fevers. They have a history of MRSA in their sputum and gram-negative bacteremia. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia and an increased respiratory rate. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and are being weaned off the ventilator.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia and elevated white blood cell count. The imaging shows diffuse haziness of the lung fields, possible fluid in the minor fissure vs atelectasis on the right, and a small left pleural effusion.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins.
3. Stress ulcers: The critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Impaired skin integrity: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the tracheostomy tube can lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
5. Infection: The patient is still febrile, indicating an ongoing infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/64 mmHg to 140/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic heparin. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 257 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and altered blood glucose levels. The patient's urine output has been low, and fluid balance has been closely monitored. The patient's respiratory status has required adjustment in ventilator settings. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and there are signs of infection with positive findings on Gram stain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The presence of central venous catheters increases the risk of CRBSI. Regular monitoring and maintenance of catheter sites are essential.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embol"

   tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [**8-/2145**] who is transferred to our
   hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin; now HD#4
   Fever: On Meropenem (Day3) And Vanco (Day2) for OSH +Blood cultures
   (enterobacter) and MRSA  sputum.   Source remains unclear as all
   imaging essentially negative.
   - f/u repeat cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool for c. diff)
   - Continue meropenem/Vanco
   - daily survaillence blood Cx
   - ID following
   - will hold all neuroleptics as potential cause of non-infectious
   fevers
   - will discuss case with IP for ? tap of R pleural effusion.
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Pt became tachy and hypoxic with trach
   mask attempt; switched back to assist control.  Given mental status and
   current infection will not attempt to wean at present.
   - continue assist control
   Encephalopathy:  Patient with chronic depressed mental status; stable
   - cautious fentanyl if evidence of discomfort
   Elevated Creatinine:  Elevated at presentation to OSH.  Now improved to
   0.8.
   - Monitor daily
   ESLD s/p liver transplant [**6-/2137**].  Liver team following.  Adjusting
   prograf levels as elevated yesterday.
   - continue prograf with daily levels/dose adjustments
   Tachycardia:  Likely secondary to known infection, discomfort.
   - fentanyl for discomfort
   - for now will not use beta blockers
   Type II Diabetes:  Sugars well controlled
   - continue lantus 28 U
   - continue sliding scale
   Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently stable.  Not on any agents.
   - continue to monitor
   FEN: TF via PEG, continue free water flushes, replete lytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD after orthotopic liver transplant, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture.
- He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin and is currently on day 4 of hospitalization.
- The patient has been febrile since admission and has been started on meropenem and vancomycin for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and MRSA sputum.
- Blood cultures have grown enterobacter, but the source of infection remains unclear as imaging has been negative.
- The patient's mental status is depressed, and he is not expected to be weaned off ventilatory support at present.
- His creatinine level has improved from the initial presentation.
- Prograf levels are being adjusted due to elevated levels.
- The patient's blood pressure and diabetes are well-controlled.
- He is receiving nutrition and glycemic control through PEG tube and insulin sliding scale.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is already suspected to have hospital-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD (end-stage liver disease) post orthotopic liver transplant in 6/00, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [8-/2145]. He was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. He has been diagnosed with OSH (obstructive shock) and is currently being treated with meropenem (an antibiotic) and vancomycin (an antibiotic) for possible bloodstream infection caused by Enterobacter species and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in his sputum. The source of infection remains unclear as all imaging has been negative. 

The patient's current health conditions include chronic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, elevated creatinine levels, ESLD post liver transplant, tachycardia, type II diabetes, and hypertension. He is receiving various treatments and interventions, including assist control ventilation, cautious use of fentanyl for discomfort, monitoring of creatinine levels, adjustment of Prograf levels, management of glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code and his disposition is ICU care.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, and impaired skin integrity. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and tachypnea. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and elevated body temperature. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance of 3,556 mL. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, but within the normal range. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The microbiology report of the sputum sample shows gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and he is receiving regular insulin for glycemic control. He is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is set to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular surveillance cultures are necessary to detect any early signs of infection.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, which increases the risk of CRBSI. Regular assessment of the lines and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient in the ICU is experiencing fever, with a spike to 101.8 in the afternoon. Blood cultures have been sent. The patient's Tacrolimus level is 4.2. Vent weaning has been attempted with good results, spending 6 hours off and 1 hour on. Sputum cultures from December 2nd showed pseudomonas sensitivity to current antibiotics. Hypernatremia remains stable at 144, and urine lytes with FeNa have been performed.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were Acyclovir on December 4th, Vancomycin on December 5th, and Meropenem on December 6th. The patient is currently receiving Fentanyl infusion and other ICU medications.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below. Flow sheet data as of December 6th shows vital signs with a maximum temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), current temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-131 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,983 mL and output of 2,200 mL, resulting in a balance of 783 mL. Respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, mechanical ventilation, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 85, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.21, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 21 mEq/L, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 22.1%.

Physical examination reveals that the patient opens eyes to voice but does not follow commands, oriented x 0, sclera anicteric, tracheostomy site intact, cervical collar in place, pupils reactive, regular heart sounds, coarse breath sounds bilaterally, soft and mildly distended abdomen, intact G-tube site, grimaces to palpation in the right lower quadrant, no organomegaly, mildly cloudy urine, wound on the right lateral foot with possible necrosis, 1+ edema, no clubbing or cyanosis, and contracted extremities.

Laboratory results show white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 4.2-5.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 22.1-27.2%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 257-268 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.8-1.4 mg/dL, blood glucose ranging from 45-108 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD post orthotopic liver transplant, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture. He is currently in the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. He has been on meropenem and vancomycin for suspected opportunistic severe pneumonia and MRSA sputum. His fever spiked over the last 24 hours, and he has shown improvement in his creatinine levels. The source of the fever remains unclear, with all imaging being negative. He has chronic respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his blood glucose levels are well controlled. He is on several medications including lantus, sliding scale insulin, prograf, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures suggest an ongoing infection. It is crucial to identify the source of infection and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and potential infections.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is depressed, indicating encephalopathy, which may affect his neurological function and ability to communicate effectively.
5. Hypertension and Diabetes: Although the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose levels are currently stable, long-term management is necessary to prevent complications associated with hypertension and diabetes.
6. ESLD: As the patient had a liver transplant, there is a risk of liver dysfunction and the need for ongoing monitoring and adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy.

The potential medical complications mentioned above require close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent further deterioration and ensure the best possible outcome for the patient."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, and severe motor vehicle accident. He underwent an orthotopic liver transplant in 2000 and has a tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient is currently in the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. He has been on meropenem and vancomycin for suspected orthopedic and MRSA sputum infections, but the source of the fever remains unclear. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 127/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated on assist control ventilation with a respiratory support device.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's attempts to wear off the ventilator have been unsuccessful due to his mental status and current infection. It is crucial to continue assist control ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has a chronic depressed mental status, which could be related to his underlying conditions or complications such as hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring is necessary, and cautious use of fentanyl should be considered if evidence of discomfort.
3. Elevated Creatinine: The patient's creatinine levels were initially elevated but have improved to 0.8. Regular monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fevers and chronic respiratory failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has impaired skin integrity. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a maximum of 101.8°F (38.8°C) overnight. Vital signs include a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/72 to 136/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Acyclovir, Vancomycin, Meropenem), fentanyl for pain management, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and slightly elevated creatinine level. The patient has abnormal liver function test results, including elevated AST and ALT levels. Microbiology results indicate the presence of a Gram-negative rod and Enterobacter in the sputum. The patient's assessment and plan include continued antibiotics, evaluation of the source of fever, management of acute on chronic respiratory failure, and monitoring for complications related to impaired skin integrity and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and abnormal white blood cell count suggest a potential infection. It is important to identify the source of the infection and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure requires"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD post orthotopic liver transplant, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture. He was admitted for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin and has been on meropenem and vancomycin for suspected infections. The patient's fever has increased over the last 24 hours despite antibiotic treatment, and all imaging has been negative. The source of infection remains unclear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may be due to prolonged bed rest or immobility, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.
2. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure, likely due to his tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation. This can lead to further lung complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung infections.
3. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment suggests an underlying infection or inflammatory condition. It is important to identify the source of infection to guide appropriate treatment.
4. Elevated Creatinine: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and adjustments to fluid and electrolyte management may be required.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's chronic depressed mental status may indicate encephalopathy, which could be secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, for the fever. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 112/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on standby ventilation support with a tracheostomy mask and has not been extubated since admission. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. The source of the infection needs to be identified and treated promptly to prevent further complications.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate a decline in kidney function. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further deterioration.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure requires continued respiratory support. Weaning off from mechanical ventilation should be considered based on the patient's clinical improvement and ability to maintain adequate oxygenation.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. Proper skin care and re"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.5 C (101.3 F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/61 to 146/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on fentanyl infusion and receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, encephalopathy, and acute renal failure. The fever started at 11:30 PM on December 6th and has been persistent. The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with a tracheostomy collar. There has been no improvement in the patient's encephalopathy. The acute renal failure has shown some improvement.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all measures should be taken to save the patient's life in case of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure leading to further hypoxia and respiratory acidosis. The fever of unknown origin could indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a fever with a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C) overnight.
- Vital signs include a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/61 mmHg to 146/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a tracheostomy mask with ventilator support.
- The patient's weight remains unchanged at 65 kg.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,071 mL and output of 2,230 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -159 mL.
- Respiratory support indicates the use of a tracheostomy mask and ventilator standby mode, with set tidal volume (VT) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 0 cmH2O.
- Physical examination reveals alert appearance but no response, chest X-ray showing bilateral Consolidation, regular heart sounds, soft abdomen without tenderness, and neurologic examination showing alertness but unresponsiveness.
- Laboratory results include hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.2 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 4.2 to 6.6 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 257 to 327 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.8 to 1.4 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.
- The patient has impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin (FUO), and encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Infection: The fever and elevated WBC count suggest the possibility of an infection. Further investigation, such as a CT scan of the chest and culture tests, may be necessary to identify the source of infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation and low oxygen saturation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are crucial.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and unresponsiveness indicate encephalopathy. The underlying cause should be investigated, and appropriate management should be implemented.
4. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's renal function has improved, ongoing monitoring is required to ensure that it does not deteriorate.
5. Pressure ulcers: The impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and appropriate wound care are essential to prevent complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD s/p orthotopic liver transplant in 6/00, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in [8-/2145]. He was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin and has been on meropenem and vancomycin for OSH + blood cultures (enterobacter) and MRSA/Pseudomonas in sputum. The patient continues to spike daily fevers, and his CT scan shows compromised lung fields/atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions. He is currently on a tracheostomy and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's compromised lung fields/atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions may lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Transitioning back to assisted ventilation if hypoxic or decrease in RR noted should be considered.

2. Infection: The patient has been on meropenem and vancomycin for suspected infections, including OSH, enterobacter, and MRSA/Pseudomonas. However, he continues to spike daily fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Repeat cultures and surveillance blood cultures should be followed up to identify the causative organism.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD (end-stage liver disease) post orthotopic liver transplant, and severe motor vehicle accident resulting in cervical spinal fracture. He is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. The patient has been experiencing daily fevers, and his chest CT scan shows right upper lobe collapse, left lower lobe collapse, bilateral pleural effusions, and right lower lobe segmental atelectasis with possible superimposed consolidation due to pneumonia. The patient also has foot wounds with possible necrosis, contracted extremities, and no purposeful movement. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The patient has ongoing infections with gram-negative rods identified in sputum and blood cultures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure is evident from the CT scan showing lung collapses and bilateral pleural effusions. This could lead to further deterioration of lung function and potential respiratory arrest.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of foot wounds with possible necrosis suggests impaired skin integrity. This can increase the risk of infection and potential tissue loss.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's chronic depressed mental status indicates encephalopathy, which could be due to hepatic dysfunction or other factors. This may progress to severe confusion or coma."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLDS (liver transplant), and severe motor vehicle accident resulting in cervical spinal fracture. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, elevated heart rate (129 bpm), and slightly low blood pressure (123/68 mmHg). The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and has bibasilar rales on pulmonary examination.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.6 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels, and an elevated lactate level of 0.8 mmol/L. Blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods, which are resistant to multiple antibiotics.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. He has ongoing fevers despite being on antibiotics, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The chest CT scan shows right upper lobe collapse, left lower lobe collapse, bilateral pleural effusions, and right lower lobe segmental atelectasis. There is also evidence of possible superimposed consolidation due to pneumonia.

The patient's immunosuppressed state due to ESLDS puts him at higher risk for opportunistic infections. His mental status is stable but depressed, and he is not following commands. There is mention of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-inch tall, 65 kg individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a fever and underwent an I&D procedure on their foot. A CT scan revealed bilateral lung collapse. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and has impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 113/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving fentanyl infusion for pain management, lansoprazole for stomach acid reduction, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis against blood clots. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 315 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level at 7.9 g/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 1.2 mg/dL, and decreased albumin level at 2.1 g/dL. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's assessment includes impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and fever of unknown origin. The plan of care includes treating the fever, addressing respiratory failure, managing contractures, and providing ICU care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and progression of the fever of unknown origin."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD (end-stage liver disease) post orthotopic liver transplant in 2000, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture resulting in tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in August 2014. 

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. He has been receiving meropenem and vancomycin for possible opportunistic superinfection, including MRSA and Pseudomonas in sputum. The sputum cultures have shown mixed flora, and repeat cultures are pending.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 122/62 to 137/75 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on T-piece with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the left base, rales bilaterally at the bases, tracheostomy site intact, and bilateral lower extremity foot wounds with possible necrosis. The patient is nonverbal, opens eyes to voice, has minimally reactive pupils, and exhibits no purposeful movement with contracted extremities.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28500/uL, elevated creatinine"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, and severe motor vehicle accident. He underwent an orthotopic liver transplant in 2000 and has tracheostomy and PEG tube placements. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure in the 80s, heart rate of 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has diminished breath sounds on the left base with rales bilaterally at the bases. Physical examination reveals no purposeful movement, contracted extremities, and bilateral lower extremity wounds with possible necrosis. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 6.6, normal hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures grew enterobacter, MRSA, and pseudomonas in the sputum, while the wound culture showed mixed flora. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever: The patient continues to spike daily fevers despite being on meropenem and vancomycin for suspected opportunistic infections. Repeat sputum cultures are pending. 
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension in the morning, which responded to fluid"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with fevers and has undergone bronchoscopy, blood cultured, and sputum cultured. The patient is also experiencing hypotension and requires IV fluids. They are receiving medications including fentanyl, lansoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs indicate a high heart rate, normal blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission.

The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and fever of unknown origin. The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: Given the presence of fever, impaired skin integrity, and positive cultures, there is a high risk of infection. The patient may develop pneumonia, bloodstream infection, or wound infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure increases the risk of further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Hypotension: The patient's episodes of hypotension indicate a possible cardiovascular issue, which may require further investigation and management to prevent organ dysfunction.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and other complications"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a non-verbal individual with impaired skin integrity and chronic respiratory failure. They have been experiencing fevers, with a current temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's blood pressure has been in the range of 122/62 to 137/75 mmHg, heart rate between 104-125 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain management, lansoprazole for gastric protection, and heparin sodium for thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient has undergone several tests including bronchoscopy, blood cultures, sputum culture, and wound culture. These tests were conducted to identify the cause of the patient's fever. The patient's blood cultures and fungal markers have been sent for analysis.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactic acid levels, as well as low hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet (Plt) levels. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), blood glucose, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar rales in the lungs, intact tracheostomy site, and bilateral lower extremity foot wounds with possible necrosis. There is also no purposeful movement observed, and the patient's extremities are contracted.

The patient was transferred to the hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin and is now on hospital day #8.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/62 mmHg to 137/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient has been experiencing daily fevers despite being on meropenem and vancomycin for suspected opportunistic surface hemolytic (OSH) bacteremia and MRSA/Pseudomonas sputum infection. The sputum culture on [12-4] showed Proteus and Pseudomonas, while the repeat sputum on [12-6] showed mixed flora. The most recent sputum culture on [12-9] is pending.

The patient's chest X-ray revealed compromised lung fields, atelectasis, and bilateral pleural effusions. Thoracentesis was"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD (end-stage liver disease) post orthotopic liver transplant, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture. He is currently in the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. The patient has been afebrile for 36 hours and is on meropenem and vancomycin for presumed opportunistic infection. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state from ESLD and chronic alcohol abuse. The presence of fever suggests a possible ongoing infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can be attributed to sepsis or hypovolemia. It requires prompt evaluation and fluid resuscitation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, as indicated by his need for tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The CT scan shows right and left lung collapse, which may contribute to his respiratory distress.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: As an ESLD patient, the patient is at risk for hepatic dysfunction. The elevated creatinine level suggests potential kidney involvement as well.
5. Neurological issues: The patient has chronic depressed mental status and encephalopathy. Monitoring his neurological"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-inch tall and 65 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been afebrile for approximately 36 hours and is currently on fentanyl infusion for pain management. Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate between 105-132 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74/53-137/96 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on T-piece. 

The patient has been receiving various treatments including vancomycin and meropenem for an unknown origin fever. Tacrolimus level is 3.8, and TSH is 5.8. The patient's social work is attempting to transfer guardianship to the patient's sister due to unreliable current guardianship. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,427 mL with outputs totaling 1,690 mL. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 65 kg. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 4.2-6.6 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated ALT/AST and alkaline phosphatase. Other lab values include elevated potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels, as well as decreased BUN, creatinine, and glucose levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD (liver transplant in 2000), and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture. The patient has been in the ICU for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.

The patient's fevers are now considered most consistent with pneumonia, and cultures including fungal cxs were sent. The patient will continue on meropenem/Vanco for a goal of 2 weeks of treatment. 

The patient experienced hypotension yesterday but responded to fluid resuscitation. The hypotension has not recurred, and follow-up cultures will be checked.

Encephalopathy: The patient has a chronic depressed mental status following a 5-minute asystolic arrest after an automobile accident. Neurologic exam appears unchanged/stable, and there was no indication of purposeful movement. Acute CNS infection is not suspected at this time, and the need for LP (lumbar puncture) has diminished. 

Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, and they are stable on trach mask. Follow-up clx (cultures) will be checked, and consideration will be given to transitioning back to AC (ambient air) if hypoxic or decrease in RR (respiratory rate) is noted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 65 kg individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown origin fever. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7 C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 105/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a T-piece. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and various other medications. Fluid balance shows an input of 5,427 mL and output of 1,690 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,737 mL. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased platelet count, and abnormal liver function test results. The patient's mental status is impaired, and they have impaired range of motion, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and an unknown origin fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in respiratory arrest.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory condition. It is important to continue investigating the cause of the fever to prevent complications associated with prolonged hyperthermia.
3. Impaired Mental Status: The patient's impaired mental status could be due to various causes such as sepsis, hypoxia"

   however, neurologic exam today appears unchanged/stable from previous
   and there was no idication of purposful movement.  Given the resoution
   of fever, acute CNS infection is not suspected at this time and need
   for LP has diminished.  TSH was elevated, but T4 normal.
   -          cautious fentanyl if evidence of discomfort
   -          consider LP if fevers return.
   Respiratory Failure: Improving.  Patient stable for several days on
   trach mask.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD post orthotopic liver transplant in 2000, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in August 2014. He was transferred to the hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. The patient has been on meropenem and vancomycin for approximately 9 days due to an outbreak of severe infections caused by resistant bacteria such as enterobacter, MRSA, pseudomonas, and proteus from sputum cultures. Repeat sputum cultures showed mixed flora. The patient's fevers are now considered to be most consistent with pneumonia, and cultures including fungal cxs have been sent. It is planned to continue meropenem/Vanco for a total of 2 weeks of treatment. Paracentesis of small left pleural effusions is being held unless fevers recur.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fevers are most consistent with pneumonia. If left untreated or if there is a resistant strain of bacteria causing the infection, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and potentially death.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension in the 70s on one occasion, which responded to fluid resuscitation. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and provide appropriate interventions to maintain"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic respiratory failure and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently on antibiotics for an unidentified infection, as indicated by the presence of fever. There is no mention of any known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate between 106-121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/58 mmHg to 135/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on T-piece.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 4,978 mL and output of 1,890 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,088 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been expectorating well.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated leukocyte count (261 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin level (7.0 g/dL), and slightly low platelet count (285 K/uL). Renal function tests show normal creatinine levels but decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Liver function tests are within normal limits, except for elevated alkaline phosphatase. Electrolyte levels are mostly within normal range, except for low potassium (3.5 mEq/L) and magnesium (1.4 mg/dL) levels. Other lab results include normal glucose levels, elevated lactic acid, decreased albumin, and elevated lactate"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fevers. Upon admission, the patient had right-sided atelectasis and liver signs off. Chest physical therapy was initiated, and the family was called due to a change in mental status following an asystolic arrest. The patient's mental status has not improved since then.

The patient has no known drug allergies. Antibiotics were administered, including vancomycin and meropenem. The patient is currently on fentanyl infusion for pain management and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for being nonverbal. Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs are stable, with a maximum temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F) and a current temperature of 37.7 C (99.9 F). Blood pressure and heart rate are within normal range, and the patient is on supplemental oxygen but maintains a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a T-piece and receiving oxygen, with an ABG result of ///25/. Physical examination reveals equal and reactive pupils, intact tracheostomy site, and no murmurs or rubs. There is evidence of contracted extremities and no purposeful movement elicited.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a peak of 324 K/uL and slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.7 g"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD (end-stage liver disease) post orthotopic liver transplant in 2000, and severe motor vehicle accident with cervical spinal fracture and subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in 8/2145. The patient was transferred to the hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. 

Since admission, the patient has been receiving meropenem and vancomycin for suspected OSH (obstructive shock) and blood cultures. Sputum cultures have shown mixed flora, GND (gram-negative diplococci), and GNR (gram-negative rods). The patient's fever re-spiked to 101°F on 12/11. 

The patient's mental status has not been the same since an apneic arrest. The patient's respiratory failure is improving, and they are stable on a tracheostomy mask with decreasing oxygen requirements. Pain control is a concern due to the patient's mental status, and there is a concern that the fentanyl drip may be clouding his mental evaluation. 

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Liver function tests are within normal limits, while kidney function tests are abnormal. Electrolyte levels are mostly within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium. Blood glucose levels are well-controlled."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) post orthotopic liver transplant in 2000. He was involved in a severe motor vehicle accident resulting in a cervical spinal fracture and subsequently had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient was transferred to the current hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. He has been experiencing intermittent fevers, and various cultures have shown mixed flora, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The patient is currently being treated with meropenem and vancomycin for suspected obstructive pneumonia and pleural effusions. His mental status has not been the same since an asystolic arrest. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fevers, along with the presence of mixed flora in the sputum cultures, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This can be a serious complication, especially given the patient's immunocompromised state due to ESLD.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has persistent pleural effusions, which may be secondary to the obstructive pneumonia or other underlying conditions. If left untreated, these effusions can lead to respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient has a history of ESLD, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, and ESLD who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant in 2000. He was involved in a severe motor vehicle accident resulting in a cervical spinal fracture and subsequently had a tracheostomy and PEG tube placement.

He has been experiencing intermittent fevers and is currently being treated with meropenem and vancomycin for suspected obstructive pneumonia and mixed flora infection. The patient's mental status has not been the same since an asystolic arrest. He also has persistent pleural effusions and is receiving chest physiotherapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever and atelectasis suggest the possibility of pneumonia. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and administer appropriate antibiotics based on the culture results.
2. Pleural Effusion: The presence of persistent pleural effusions may indicate an underlying infection or fluid accumulation in the lungs. Further evaluation through paracentesis and analysis of the effusion fluid is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status since the asystolic arrest requires further investigation. Neurological consult and additional tests such as a repeat lumbar puncture may be needed to assess for any neurological conditions contributing to his symptoms.

","Summary:
The patient presented with fevers and was found to have right-sided atelectasis on chest X-ray. The patient's mental status has not been the same since an asystolic arrest occurred. The patient is currently unresponsive and nonverbal. They have been receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem) and are on fentanyl for pain management. The patient is also receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F) and a current temperature of 37.7 C (99.9 F). The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but their heart rate is slightly elevated. The patient is on respiratory support with T-piece and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory failure, and they are currently on respiratory support. The presence of right-sided atelectasis on chest X-ray suggests potential complications related to their respiratory status.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers, and the source of infection remains unidentified. This could lead to complications associated with an underlying infection.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.
4. Impaired Arousal, Attention, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, ESLD, and severe motor vehicle accident. He underwent orthotopic liver transplant in 2000 and subsequently had a cervical spinal fracture, tracheostomy, and PEG tube placement. The patient was admitted for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin. He has been febrile on and off since admission, with spikes to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. He is currently on meropenem and vancomycin for suspected obstructive pneumonia and mixed flora. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired range of motion, impaired skin integrity, and fever of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and positive cultures for enterobacter, MRSA, pseudomonas, and proteus suggest an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which may worsen if there are any complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Neurological Dysfunction: The patient's impaired arousal, attention, and cognition could indicate a neurological disorder. This may be related to the spinal cord injury or other underlying conditions.
4. Skin Breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can lead"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is in the ICU with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and altered mental status.
- The patient has a cervical fracture with spinal cord injury and is experiencing acute and chronic pain.
- The patient's arousal, attention, and cognition are impaired, and they have impaired range of motion and skin integrity.
- The patient also has chronic respiratory failure and a low-grade fever of unknown origin.
- The patient has anemia and pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics adjusted for the latest cultures.
- The patient's mental status has improved somewhat after reducing fentanyl.
- Oxygenation is good on the tracheal mask, and the patient is not in respiratory distress.
- The patient's hematocrit levels are stable and do not require transfusion.
- Renal function has normalized.
- The patient's nutrition is being provided through a feeding tube, and glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's chronic respiratory failure and presence in the ICU, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as changing antibiotic therapy based on sputum culture sensitivity and maintaining good respiratory hygiene should be continued.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and the presence of central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin,"

   Repeat sputum [**12-9**] with mixed flora; and [**12-10**] now w/ Acinetobactor and
   Pseudomonas.  Both sensitive to meropenem. Given the positive cultures
   and lack of addional evidence of infection, it is likely that his
   persistant fevers are related to his post-obstructive pneumonia and
   persistant pleural effusions. CSF from last week

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, alcohol abuse, and ESLD who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant in 2000. He was involved in a severe motor vehicle accident, resulting in a cervical spinal fracture and subsequent tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in August 2145. He was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of fevers of unknown origin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 166/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 324 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 28 mEq/L, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies reveal surgical fusion of C5-T1 posteriorly and C6-T1 anteriorly without definite hardware complication, no evidence of cervical spine fracture, medial right clavicle fracture, and sphenoid sinus op"
