","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. He presents with ongoing diarrhea and dehydration. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count with 30% bands, elevated troponin levels, and signs of renal insufficiency. Imaging studies reveal evidence of colitis but no free air or obstruction. The patient is being treated for C. diff colitis, dehydration, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, and other comorbidities. Potential medical complications include recurrence or relapse of C. diff colitis, infectious diarrhea, acute kidney injury, hypoxia, and cardiac issues."

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. He presents with ongoing diarrhea, dehydration, and hypotension. The patient has elevated white blood cell count with 30% bands, indicating a possible infection. Stool cultures have been sent to confirm the presence of C. diff. He is currently receiving IV Flagyl and PO Vanc to treat the suspected infection. The patient's pleural effusion etiology is unclear, and he requires further evaluation with a chest CT. His acute on chronic renal insufficiency is likely due to dehydration and poor oral intake. The patient's chronic leg edema may be related to thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. He has a history of falls, and his recent fall was likely orthostatic. The patient's blood pressure and electrolyte levels are unstable, and his medications have been adjusted accordingly. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence or relapse of C. diff colitis.
2. Infectious diarrhea.
3. Pleural effusion.
4. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Chronic leg edema.
6. Hypoxia.
7. Coronary artery disease (CAD).
8. Diabetic neuropathy.
9. Hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical issues. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications, including vancomycin, metronidazole, ferrous sulfate, oxycodone, Tylenol, Prilosec, aspirin, regular insulin sliding scale, heparin subcutaneous, vancomycin 500 q6, and Flagyl IV q8. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/46 to 123/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's extremities show edema in both lower limbs. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and elevated levels of AST, ALT, and LDH. An abdominal CT scan revealed no free air or toxic megacolon, but there was mild colonic wall thickening. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, which may be related to the numbness/tingling in their extremities. The patient is also experiencing hypovolemia, hypotension, WBC/bandemia, Clostridium difficile infection, renal insufficiency, fall risk, and a left-sided pleural effusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently being treated in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need attention.

1. Hypovolemia and Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood volume and low blood pressure. The plan is to continue volume repletion by bolusing 500cc and maintaining fluid intake.

2. WBC + Bandemia: The patient has an increased white blood cell count with bands, suggesting a possible infection. It is likely secondary to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The plan is to follow up with stool C. diff and repeat diff today. The patient will be on oral vancomycin and intravenous flagyl, and the RN will closely monitor stool output. Prilosec will be discontinued.

3. Falls: The patient has experienced falls likely due to weakness and may be related to renal insufficiency. A PT evaluation is needed, and the patient may require assistance with mobility.

4. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The plan is to continue monitoring creatinine levels and decrease heparin dose to once a day.

5. Hypoxia: The patient has low oxygen saturation levels. However, it is not clear if this is due to a poor oxygen probe pick-up or an underlying issue. Further evaluation is required.

6. Left-sided Pleural Effusion: The patient has a left"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 year old male with HTN, DM, CRI and recent C.diff colitis presents
   with ongoing diarrhea and dehyrdation
   # Diarrhea- Etiology may be [**2-6**] to recurrence/relapse of C.diff colitis
   given recent history of, known + C.diff at rehab and incomplete
   treatment course. However viral gastroenteritis vs bacterial also on
   differntial. Pt does have elevated WBC with 30% bands now improving.
   C.Diff positive on admission.
   -Continue IV Flagyl, PO Vanc- currently day #[**3-18**] (start date [**2-11**])
   -LR boluses prn
   -Hold ACE, BP meds given hypotension
   -KUB and CT Abdomen done; evidence of colitis; no free air/obstruction
   or megacolon
   -?Curbside ID regarding duration
   #Elevated WBC- Presume [**2-6**] infectious diarrhea, At presentation
   bandemia 30%, U/A negative, CXR w/o obvious infection; will treat for
   C.diff as above and low threshold to start empiric treatment with
   Vanc/Zosyn if hemodynamically unstable, spikes fever
   -Culture data to date only positive for C.diff
   -Follow daily diffs on leukocytosis (currently trending down)
   # Pleural Effusion: Unclear etiology as he is clinically hypovolemic.
   Patient with known AR/MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] need Chest CT in future after acute
   issues resolve, however may need thoracentesis if persistently febrile.
   #RUE Swelling- Will get U/S to evaluate for DVT (especially b/c pt has
   ? h/o clots and s/p IVC filter)
   #Acute on Chronic Renal insufficiency- Pts Cr 2.8 and BUN 77;
   consistent with dehydration; especially given large volume stool output
   over past few days and poor PO intake.  Patient has been rehydrated in
   ED with 4L NS. Cr initially improved but now 2.6. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN (had
   hypotension); vs pre-renal.
   -Send urine lytes today
   -Renally dose meds
   -Check renal U/S with dopplers
   #LE edema- This has been a chronic issue per OMR notes and the patients
   daughter; workup to date has included an ECHO [**11-13**] which showed an
   EF>55%. In setting of no anticoagulation and IVC filter in place,
   suspect thrombosis of filter contributing to edema. Proteinuria noted
   on urinalysis and concern previously was for nephrotic syndrome; with
   plans for outpatient neprhology.  Final CT read does show chronically
   occluded IVC filter.
   -Hold on diuretics
   #s/p IVC Filter- Appears occluded on CT Scan; has h/o DVT
   -Talk w/family regarding risks/benefits of anti-coagulation (especially
   given high fall risk)
   #CAD-No known coronary history but has risk factors & today's EKG with
   TWI in V1-V3 and first set of enzymes CK 348, MB 15, MBI 4.3, Troponin
   0.11 Presume Troponin elevated in setting of renal insufficiency
   (previous troponin on last admission 0.35), All 3 sets remained flat.
   -Continue aspirin
   #Hypoxia- Patient noted to be hypoxic in ED; has not been hypoxic since
   arrival to ICU. CXR with no evidence of pneumonia and recently
   completed course for HAP.  Hypoxia not an issue since arrival
   -Supplemental O2 prn
   #DM- Hold oral agents, continue ISS but not requiring any since
   admission
   -Continue aspirin
   #. Neuropathy: Chronic per recent gerontology notes
   #HTN- Hold anti-HTNs given dehydration/hypotension on arrival
   -bolus with LR prn
   #Rheumatoid Arthritis
   -Holding oxycodone [**2-6**] delirium
   #H/O Recent [**Name (NI) 13115**] Pt has ongoing history of falls, CT Head/Cspine
   negative per ED, no prodrome prior to fall per pt and may have been
   orthostatic.
   -Follow up final CT Head/Cspine read
   -ROMI as above
   #BPH- On Flomax at home, will hold until BP stable
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: PPI, heparin SQ, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   # CODE:  FULL per pt

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient presents with ongoing diarrhea and dehydration.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving IV Flagyl for C. diff infection, as well as PO Vanc. The patient is also receiving LR boluses as needed. ACE and BP medications have been held due to hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count with 30% bands, indicating a possible infectious process. The patient has a history of C. diff positive at the rehab facility and an incomplete treatment course. Other lab results show abnormalities in electrolytes, renal function, liver function, and cardiac markers.

Imaging studies reveal colonic wall thickening, which may be related to the reported history of C. diff colitis. There is also evidence of total body anasarca with free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis. Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis is noted, along with small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Bilateral renal cysts, some appearing hemorrhagic, are seen, as well as an infrarenal IVC filter, which may be chronically occluded.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with C. diff diarrhea. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving IV fluids and antibiotics for his condition. His vital signs are stable, but he has low blood pressure that is being managed with IV fluid boluses. The patient has a history of falls and neuropathy, which makes him a poor candidate for anticoagulation. He also has acute on chronic renal failure, right arm swelling, leukocytosis, and lower extremity edema. Further evaluation and treatment plans are being made for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed with IV fluid boluses. If not appropriately managed, it may lead to shock and organ dysfunction.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient is already on Flagyl IV and po vancomycin, which are appropriate treatments for C. diff. However, he needs to be monitored closely for worsening symptoms, as C. diff can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Falls: The patient's history of neuropathy and recent reports of instability with a walker increase his risk of falls. If he were to fall, it could result in serious injury, especially considering his compromised renal function.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and further evaluation with urine tests and renal ultrasound is needed. If left untreated,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of C.diff diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, except for low blood pressure. The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) repletion and is tolerating them well. He has no known drug allergies and is currently on various medications including MVI, ferrous sulfate, acetaminophen, oxycontin (on hold), ASA 325, insulin sliding scale, flagyl, vancomycin oral, and heparin subcutaneous.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the C.diff diarrhea. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin build, normocephalic head, and crackles in the left base of the chest. He also has bilateral lower extremity edema, which is described as woody edema. Neurologically, he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movements with normal tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count within normal range. Blood glucose levels are low, and troponin-T levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits or only slightly abnormal. Imaging has not revealed any new findings.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. He presents with ongoing diarrhea, dehydration, and an elevated white blood cell count. The patient has been treated with IV Flagyl and oral vancomycin, with plans for continued treatment. His pleural effusion is unclear in etiology, and he has right upper extremity swelling without evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient's renal function is compromised, possibly due to dehydration and hypotension. He has chronic leg edema, proteinuria, and a history of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. The IVC filter appears to be occluded on CT scan. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, neuropathy, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He is currently experiencing delirium and has a history of falls.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence/relapse of C. diff colitis

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. He presents with ongoing diarrhea and dehydration. The patient has elevated white blood cell count with 30% bands, which is improving. He is currently being treated for C. diff infection with IV Flagyl and oral Vancomycin. The patient's pleural effusion etiology is unclear, and he has right upper extremity swelling due to a superficial clot. His acute on chronic renal insufficiency is consistent with dehydration, and his renal function is being closely monitored. The patient has chronic lower extremity edema, and his inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is occluded. He also has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, neuropathy, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient's recent fall was likely orthostatic in nature.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence or relapse of C. diff colitis
2. Development of sepsis or systemic infection due to bandemia and elevated WBC count
3. Progression of pleural effusion and potential development of respiratory complications
4. Further deterioration of renal function due to dehydration and possible acute tubular necrosis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with ongoing diarrhea, weakness, and multiple medical complications. They have a history of diarrhea but it has decreased in recent days. The patient's leukocytosis is stable and bandemia has resolved. They are being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole, which will continue for another two and one weeks, respectively. Blood cultures were taken due to ongoing fluid needs and septic physiology. 

The patient is contraindicated for anticoagulation due to falls and an inferior vena cava (IVC) clot. They have been placed on an IVC filter. For the superficial right arm clot, the patient is advised to elevate their arm and use cold compresses for comfort.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 36.5°C to 37.1°C, heart rate between 94 and 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/64 mmHg to 113/69 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20 and 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. Their weight remains unchanged at 63.1 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,725 mL with outputs of 1,335 mL through the mouth, 650 mL through urine, and 670 mL through drains, resulting in a positive balance of 3,075 mL.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 13"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 year old male with HTN, DM, CRI and recent C.diff colitis presents
   with ongoing diarrhea and dehyrdation
   # Diarrhea- Etiology likely  [**2-6**] to recurrence/relapse of C.diff
   colitis given recent history of, known + C.diff at rehab and incomplete
   treatment course. However viral gastroenteritis vs bacterial also on
   differntial. Pt does have elevated WBC with 30% bands now improving to
   11%  C.Diff positive on admission.
   - Continue IV Flagyl, PO Vanc- -per ID will plan for 7 days flagyl
   (day#[**4-11**]) and 3 weeks of PO Vanc
   - LR boluses prn
   - Hold ACE, BP meds given hypotension
   - KUB and CT Abdomen done; evidence of colitis; no free air/obstruction
   or megacolon
   #Elevated WBC- Presume [**2-6**] infectious diarrhea, At presentation
   bandemia 30%, U/A negative, CXR w/o obvious infection; will treat for
   C.diff as above and low threshold to start empiric treatment with
   Vanc/Zosyn if hemodynamically unstable, spikes fever. Given degree of
   bandemia on admission and that today is the first time no bands are
   visiualized, would expect for leukocytosis to start improving in next
   24-48hrs
   - Culture data to date neagative, positive for C.diff toxin
   - Follow daily diffs on leukocytosis (currently trending down)
   # Pleural Effusion: Unclear etiology as he is clinically hypovolemic.
   Patient with known AR/MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] need Chest CT in future after acute
   issues resolve, however may need thoracentesis if persistently febrile-
   afebrile o/n
   #RUE Swelling- Ultrasound o/n showed no evidence of DVT, however
   superficial clot
   #Acute on Chronic Renal insufficiency- Pts Cr 2.8 and BUN 77;
   consistent with dehydration; especially given large volume stool output
   over past few days and poor PO intake.  Patient has been rehydrated in
   ED with 4L NS. Cr initially improved but now 2.6. [**Month (only) 51**] be ATN (had
   hypotension); vs pre-renal.
   -FENA 0.2
   -Renally dose meds
   -Renal ultrasound done with no acute change
   -Consider renal c/s
   #LE edema- This has been a chronic issue per OMR notes and the patients
   daughter; workup to date has included an ECHO [**11-13**] which showed an
   EF>55%. In setting of no anticoagulation and IVC filter in place,
   suspect thrombosis of filter contributing to edema. Proteinuria noted
   on urinalysis and concern previously was for nephrotic syndrome; with
   plans for outpatient neprhology.  Final CT read does show chronically
   occluded IVC filter.
   -Hold on diuretics
   #s/p IVC Filter- Appears occluded on CT Scan; has h/o DVT
   -Family understands risks of anti-coagulation; will hold for now
   #CAD-No known coronary history but has risk factors & today's EKG with
   TWI in V1-V3 and first set of enzymes CK 348, MB 15, MBI 4.3, Troponin
   0.11 Presume Troponin elevated in setting of renal insufficiency
   (previous troponin on last admission 0.35), All 3 sets remained flat.
   -Continue aspirin
   #DM- Hold oral agents, continue ISS but not requiring any since
   admission
   -Continue aspirin
   #. Neuropathy: Chronic per recent gerontology notes
   #HTN- Hold anti-HTNs given hypotension
   -bolus with LR prn
   #Rheumatoid Arthritis
   -Holding oxycodone [**2-6**] delirium
   #H/O Recent [**Name (NI) 13115**] Pt has ongoing history of falls, CT Head/Cspine
   negative per ED, no prodrome prior to fall per pt and may have been
   orthostatic.
   -Follow up final CT Head/Cspine read
   -ROMI as above
   #BPH- On Flomax at home, will hold until BP stable

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient presents with ongoing diarrhea and dehydration. The etiology of the diarrhea is likely due to a recurrence/relapse of C. diff colitis, although other possibilities such as viral gastroenteritis or bacterial infection are also considered.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with 30% bands, which indicates an infectious process. He has been treated with intravenous Flagyl and oral Vancomycin, with plans for a 7-day course of Flagyl and 3 weeks of PO Vanc. The patient is also receiving LR boluses as needed.

The patient's pleural effusion has unclear etiology and is being monitored closely. A chest CT in the future may be necessary to further evaluate the condition. The patient also has right upper extremity swelling, which showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis on ultrasound, but there is a superficial clot present.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.6 and BUN level of 77. This is consistent with dehydration, especially given the large volume stool output over the past few days and poor oral intake. The patient has been rehydrated in the emergency department with 4 liters of normal saline. Renal ultrasound did not reveal any acute"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) colitis. The patient presents with ongoing diarrhea, dehydration, and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 19.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.1%, platelet count of 244 K/uL, creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 103 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.05 ng/mL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows increasing extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis, suggesting a developing pneumonia. Small left-sided pleural effusion is also present, along with new blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, which could indicate a small pleural effusion.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, cyanosis, and chronic ven"

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE): in improved hemodynamic standpoint, Creatinine improved,
   Urine out put better. Continue IV 1L of IV fluids and creatinine is not
   yet at baseline.
 Leukocytosis:  still persistent, and more elevated, follow up
   differential, given improvement in every other respect.. will not start
   broad spectrum antibiotics just yet.. less likely is infection of the
   clot in the IVC or Clot contributing to elevated white count. He is on
   s/c heparin if wbc continues to rise will consider starting him on
   therapeutic anticoagulation, this seems less likely. Repeat urine and
   blood cultures today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of diarrhea and weakness. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/65 to 125/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for improved hemodynamics and better urine output. 

The patient's blood cultures have been negative to date, and he is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and s/c heparin for leukocytosis. The patient's white blood cell count is still increasing but feels better today. His lab results show elevated WBC count, creatinine levels, and slightly low albumin and potassium levels. The patient's imaging and microbiology reports are also included in the note. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) - The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and weakness could be due to C. diff infection, especially considering his recent antibiotic use.
2. Leukocytosis - The patient's white blood cell count is still elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection or other inflammatory process.
3. Fluid imbalance - The patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids, but his fluid balance is not yet at baseline, indicating potential ongoing fluid management issues"
