","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension who was admitted with fevers and a possible urinary source, as well as NSTEMI. The patient presented with diaphoresis and shortness of breath, and cardiac enzymes were rising. He was started on aspirin, a beta-blocker, and heparin.

The patient experienced acute respiratory distress upon arrival to the floor and received diltiazem in the ED. Initially, an allergic reaction was considered, but the patient improved with nebs, epinephrine, hydrocortisone, and benadryl. A possible pulmonary embolism (PE) was also considered, but the CT angiogram (CTA) was negative.

The patient is wheezing and has decreased air entry with emphysematous changes on CT, which may indicate a COPD exacerbation. There is a right basilar opacity on the chest X-ray, but it is most likely atelectasis. The patient had a recent prostate biopsy and had fevers, leukocytosis, and a left shift, likely from a urinary source. He also had episodes of diarrhea over the last two days.

The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and his blood pressure is being managed with amlodipine, metoprolol, and valsartan. The patient's glycemic control is well controlled, and his lines were placed on [**2178-4-18**] at 08:05 AM. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient's code status and disposition are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation with acute respiratory distress upon arrival to the floor suggests the possibility of ARDS, especially considering his wheezing and decreased air entry with emphysematous changes on CT.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, leukocytosis, and left shift indicate a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis. The recent prostate biopsy and urinary symptoms may suggest a urinary tract infection as the source.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's initial presentation with acute renal failure indicates the possibility of AKI. However, it has since resolved, likely due to improved fluid management.

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CTA was negative, the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and diaphoresis could still suggest a PE as a potential complication.

5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's wheezing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension who was admitted to the ICU with fevers, possible urinary source, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and has undergone prostate biopsy. He is experiencing acute respiratory distress, likely related to NSTEMI, and intermittent episodes of shortness of breath. The patient also has leukocytosis, likely from a urinary source, and a couple of episodes of diarrhea. His renal function has improved from acute renal failure, but he still requires intravenous fluids. The patient's blood pressure is being managed with amlodipine, metoprolol, and valsartan. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being closely monitored. The patient has multiple lines and is receiving systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory distress and intermittent episodes of shortness of breath may indicate the development of ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's leukocytosis and likely urinary source suggest a possible UTI. If left untreated, this can lead to complications such as sepsis and kidney infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension who was admitted with fevers possibly originating from a urinary source and a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient has been started on aspirin, a beta-blocker, heparin, and a statin. An echocardiogram has been ordered for Monday, and heparin will be continued until cardiac enzymes start to trend down. 

The patient experienced acute respiratory distress upon arrival to the floor, which is likely related to the NSTEMI. Intermittent episodes of respiratory distress have occurred since. 

There is a mention of a potential allergic reaction yesterday, but it is unlikely. Steroids may be discontinued. 

The patient underwent a prostate biopsy at [**Hospital1 147**], which revealed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This information has not yet been disclosed to the patient. 

The patient also has leukocytosis and a left shift, suggesting a urinary source of infection. He has had several episodes of diarrhea over the last two days. 

Broad-spectrum antibiotics with double coverage for Klebsiella ESBL are being continued with cefepime and ciprofloxacin. 

Acute renal failure has resolved, with unclear baseline. It is likely pre-renal due to poor oral intake over the last two days. 

The patient's hypertension is being managed with aml"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension admitted to the ICU for fevers with a possible urinary source and NSTEMI. The patient presented with acute respiratory distress upon arrival to the floor, intermittent episodes of shortness of breath, and a positive troponin indicating myocardial injury. 

The patient has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to leukocytosis and potential urinary tract infection. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and he is now being monitored for hypertension. 

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, heparin, aspirin, a statin, and amlodipine. His diet is cardiac, and he is not currently receiving any stress ulcer prophylaxis or VAP prevention measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of NSTEMI, development of sepsis due to ongoing infection, exacerbation of acute respiratory distress, and potential complications related to his prostate cancer diagnosis."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension admitted to the ICU with fevers and possible urinary source, as well as NSTEMI. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 167/99 to 188/141 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including statin, beta-blocker, heparin, metoprolol, valsartan, atorvastatin, and ASA. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range, and troponin-T levels are plateauing. Other lab results, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient has undergone several tests, including blood cultures, urine culture, rapid respiratory viral screen and culture, and a CT scan of the abdomen. The urine culture showed gram-negative rods, while the blood cultures are pending. The CT scan revealed liver nodules, which need further evaluation.

The patient's assessment and plan include optimizing medical regimen with control of heart rate and blood pressure, continuing heparin gtt, and monitoring for ongoing ischemia. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       NSTEMI: in setting of severe HTN tachy and fevers, diaphoresis
   but no chest pain. Rx ASA, increase bblocker and heparin gtts x 48 hrs.
   Start statin. Check ECG this AM. Will need Cardiology follow up for
   stress testing and possible cath when stable and infection resolved.
   2.       Resp Distress: most likely due to pulm edema in setting of
   NSTEMI. Improved.
   3.       UTI: post prostate Bx, on Cipro/Cefipime
 following up on
   cultures
   4.       ARF: Cr down to 1.2, follow trend and UOP
   5.       Liver nodule: ultrasound today to better characterize

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       NSTEMI: in setting of severe HTN tachy and fevers, diaphoresis
   but no chest pain. Rx ASA, statin, increase bblocker and continue
   heparin gtts. Checkrepeat ECG this AM. Will need Cardiology consult
   today for discussion re: possible cath when stable and infection
   resolved versus max med management.
   2.       Resp Distress: most likely due to pulm edema in setting of
   NSTEMI. Improved.
   3.       UTI: post prostate Bx, on Cipro/Cefipime
 following up on
   cultures- 1000 colonies most recently. Would repeat UA and CX and d/c
   foley. Should have cleared
 check prostate exam and if painful call
   Urology should be consulted.
   4.       ARF: Cr down to 1.0, follow trend and UOP
   5.       Liver nodule: ultrasound today to better characterize

","Summary:
The patient presented with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with NSTEMI. They have been started on statin and their blood pressure has been managed with titration of a blocker. The patient also has a history of severe hypertension, fevers, diaphoresis, and no chest pain. They were given ASA and heparin, and an ECG was repeated this morning. A cardiology consult is needed for discussion regarding possible catheterization when stable and infection resolved versus maximum medical management.

The patient's respiratory distress is most likely due to pulmonary edema in the setting of NSTEMI and has improved.

The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) following a prostate biopsy and is currently being treated with Ciprofloxacin and Cefepime. Cultures showed 1000 colonies most recently, and a repeat urine analysis and chest X-ray are planned. Foley catheter should be discontinued, and a repeat prostate exam should be performed. If the exam is painful, Urology should be consulted.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is being monitored, with creatinine levels trending down to 1.0. The patient's urine output (UOP) will continue to be followed.

A liver nodule was detected, and an ultrasound is scheduled today to better characterize it.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving AHA diet for nutrition and SSRI for glycemic control. They have an 18-gauge line placed on [**"
