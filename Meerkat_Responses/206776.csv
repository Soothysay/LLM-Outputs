","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for a congestive heart failure exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient arrived on the floor and developed RVR with an inability to sustain a normal blood pressure. She underwent cardioversion on the floor and is now in sinus rhythm.

The patient is receiving infusions of amiodarone at 1 mg/min and furosemide (Lasix) at 4 mg/hour. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure symptoms may worsen due to her atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, which could indicate acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal in nature due to diuresis from Lasix.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), aortic stenosis, dCHF, and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient underwent cardioversion and is now in sinus rhythm, with occasional rate-controlled episodes of atrial fibrillation overnight.

Potential medical complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications such as blood clots, stroke, or heart failure.
2. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure symptoms have worsened, likely due to her atrial fibrillation. This can result in fluid accumulation, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels increased after starting furosemide, suggesting a possible pre-renal acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid hormone levels are unclear, and there is a need to check TSH levels. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, weight gain, and slowed metabolism.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite medical interventions. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications are required.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), aortic stenosis, dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient experienced several medical complications during her stay in the ICU:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed RVR with an inability to sustain a normal blood pressure. She underwent cardioversion and is now in sinus rhythm, with some brief episodes of rate-controlled atrial fibrillation overnight.

2. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure: This is likely related to the patient's atrial fibrillation. She received a lasix gtt and strict input/output monitoring.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had a bump in her creatinine after starting lasix. It is suspected to be pre-renal in the setting of diuresis. Her creatinine levels are now resolving.

4. Nausea: The patient experienced nausea after cardioversion, which is likely related to anesthesia with etomidate. She received Zofran and compazine for relief.

5. Diabetes: The patient is on metformin at home. However, her diabetes management plan is currently being held due to her acute illness.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation and transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient experienced multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation and RVR during her stay in the CCU, which were treated with cardioversion and digoxin. She also presented with nausea after cardioversion, likely related to anesthesia with etomidate. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with RVR indicates an irregular and often rapid heart rate, which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased blood pressure.

2. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure symptoms may worsen due to the atrial fibrillation, leading to fluid retention, pulmonary edema, and compromised cardiac function.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest a decline in renal function, possibly due to pre-renal causes such as dehydration or decreased cardiac output. Monitoring of kidney function is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is significantly low, indicating the need for dose adjustment or evaluation of thyroid hormone"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted from the cardiology clinic for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with RVR. The patient experienced several episodes of atrial fibrillation, including one episode of RVR, and underwent cardioversion. She is currently on PO amiodarone, which will be increased, and digoxin has been stopped. Telemetry is ongoing, and Coumadin is being held due to a supratherapeutic INR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for a heart failure exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent cardioversion on the floor and experienced multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, treated with cardioversion, digoxin, and fluid bolus. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is low, ruling out myocardial infarction with three sets of enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute on chronic heart failure: The patient's symptoms are likely related to her atrial fibrillation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient had an increase in creatinine, possibly due to pre-renal causes, and is currently at 1.0 but still above her baseline of 0.7.
3. Diabetes: The patient is currently on metformin at home, but it is being held for now, and insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is low, indicating hypothyroidism. The home dose of levothyroxine needs to be clarified and likely decreased. It is also being held for now.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been borderline"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of heart failure (CHF), chronic atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and other comorbidities. The patient presented to the ICU with an acute exacerbation of CHF and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 104/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has received fluid bolus, increased amniotic fluid intake, and restarted coumadin at a reduced dose due to potential potentiation by amniotic fluid. Levothyroxine administration has been temporarily halted, and ativan has been given for insomnia.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and potassium (K+), as well as decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt). The patient's troponin-T levels remain within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of heart failure (CHF): The patient's presentation with an acute exacerbation of CHF indicates ongoing cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid balance, hemodynamics, and respiratory status is necessary to manage this condition effectively.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with RVR: The patient's current episode of"

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   72 year-old female with PMHx of DM, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and new
   diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who was admitted from cardiology
   clinic for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial
   fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt arrived on the floor and developed RVR with
   inability to sustain a normal blood pressure. The floor team was
   limited in their use of metoprolol because of the patient's
   hypotension. She underwent cardioversion on the floor and then was
   transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. In the CCU, she had
   add
l episodes of Afib/RVR, treated by cardioversion once, digoxin
   once, and multiple fluid boluses. Last episode RVR [**4-22**] which resolved
   with fluid boluses. TSH 0.39. MI ruled out with 3 sets of enzymes. HR
   well controlled ranging 80s to 120s, improved from 130s previously. Pt
   complains only of occaissional short lived palpitations
   -continue
 dose Coumadin (2.5mg) restarted y/d INR 1.7 today goal [**3-14**],
   continue to monitor INR
   -amnio loading with amniodorone 400MG TID
   -continue to hold metoprolol (MAPS 68)
   -OOB/walking, assess HR response on telemetry
   -possible plan for repeat cardioversion this week
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Heart Failure
EF 50%.  Likely related to pt's
   atrial fibrillation. Had been initially diuresed a little but not much
   given RVR and has had multiple fluid boluses. CXR no improvement, still
   evidence of overload on exam. Now with BP
s tolerating would resume
   lasix drip. MAPS 60
s to 70s from 50
s to 60s. Would resume lasix drip
   for gentler diuresis, no big volume changes. UOP has been 80cc/hr
   without lasix gtt. Negative 400cc/24.
   - treat Afib as above
   .lasix drip, goal 500-1L
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Trace AR: Last Echo [**10-18**]
EF 50%
   Can tolerate gentle diuresis.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Pt had a bump in her creatinine in the setting
   of starting lasix. Likely pre-renal. Creatinine improved at 0.9 but
   still above baseline of 0.7.
   -lasix bolus
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - holding metformin and lisinopril
   .
   # Diabetes - On metformin at home.
   - holding metformin for now
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - Not entirely clear on home dose. TSH 0.39.
   - need to clarify home dose and likely decrease dose
   - holding thyroid hormone for now given amniodorone loading
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension
 Normotensive this morning; borderline hypotensive
   overnight.
   - holding lisinopril, as above

   ICU Care
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), aortic stenosis, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for exacerbation of CHF and later transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) due to AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The patient experienced multiple episodes of AF/RVR and underwent cardioversion twice. She is currently on amiodarone 400 mg three times a day and has an ongoing Coumadin (warfarin) drip. The patient's heart rate is well-controlled, ranging from the 80s to 120s, and she complains of occasional short-lived palpitations.

In terms of acute on chronic heart failure, the patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 50%, which is likely related to her atrial fibrillation. Initially, she was diuresed slightly but not aggressively due to RVR. She received multiple fluid boluses, and her CXR showed no improvement, indicating evidence of overload. Therefore, it is planned to resume the lasix drip for gentler diuresis, with a goal of 500-1L.

The patient also has moderate aortic stenosis (AS), with an area of 1.0-1.2 cm2 and trace aortic reg"

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   72 year-old female with PMHx of DM, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and new
   diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who was admitted from cardiology
   clinic for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial
   fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt arrived on the floor and developed RVR with
   inability to sustain a normal blood pressure. The floor team was
   limited in their use of metoprolol because of the patient's
   hypotension. She underwent cardioversion on the floor and then was
   transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. In the CCU, she had
   add
l episodes of Afib/RVR, treated by cardioversion once, digoxin
   once, and multiple fluid boluses. Last episode RVR [**4-22**] which resolved
   with fluid boluses. TSH 0.39. MI ruled out with 3 sets of enzymes. HR
   well controlled ranging 80s to 120s, improved from 130s previously. Pt
   complains only of occaissional short lived palpitations
   -continue
 dose Coumadin (2.5mg) restarted y/d INR 1.7 today goal [**3-14**],
   continue to monitor INR
   -amnio loading with amniodorone 400MG TID
   -continue to hold metoprolol (MAPS 68)
   -Getting OOB to chair/BR, get OOB/walking, assess HR response on
   telemetry
   -possible plan for repeat cardioversion this week
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Heart Failure
EF 50%.  Likely related to pt's
   atrial fibrillation. Had been initially diuresed a little but not much
   given RVR and has had multiple fluid boluses. CXR no improvement, still
   evidence of overload on exam. Now with BP
s tolerating would resume
   lasix drip. MAPS 60
s to 70s from 50
s to 60s. Would resume lasix drip
   for gentler diuresis, no big volume changes. UOP has been 80cc/hr
   without lasix gtt. Negative 400cc/24.
   - treat Afib as above
   .lasix drip, goal 500-1L

   Can tolerate gentle diuresis.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Pt had a bump in her creatinine in the setting
   of starting lasix. Likely pre-renal. Creatinine improved at 0.9 but
   still above baseline of 0.7.
   -lasix bolus

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, aortic stenosis, diastolic heart failure, and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU from the cardiology clinic for congestive heart failure exacerbation and later transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient underwent cardioversion twice and was started on amiodarone for rhythm control.

24-hour events:
- The patient had some runs in the 130s but tolerated blood pressure-wise and remained asymptomatic.
- Coumadin was restarted, and a nuclear stress test was rescheduled.
- A repeat chest X-ray showed no appreciable interval change, with persistent left infra-hilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions. The heart size was top normal, and there were chronic multiple right rib fractures without pneumothorax.
- The patient's heart rate was better controlled, mostly in the 100-120s.
- Social work consultation was requested due to the patient's issues coping with her recent diagnoses.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis, and chronic heart failure who was admitted for exacerbation of CHF and transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She underwent cardioversion and is currently on amiodarone and Coumadin. The patient has had some runs in the 130s, tolerated BP-wise, asymptomatic, and has ongoing issues coping with her recent diagnoses. Review of systems is unchanged from admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and other cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to the stress of atrial fibrillation, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath, fluid retention, and reduced cardiac output.
3. Renal Failure: The patient had an increase in creatinine levels, indicating a possible pre-renal acute renal failure, likely due to dehydration or hypotension. It is important to monitor renal function closely.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been borderline hypotensive at times, requiring careful monitoring and adjustment of medications to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is low, suggesting hypothyroidism. It is necessary to clarify the"

 ANXIETY
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   72 year-old female with PMHx of DM, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and new
   diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who was admitted from cardiology
   clinic for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial
   fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt arrived on the floor and developed RVR with
   inability to sustain a normal blood pressure. The floor team was
   limited in their use of metoprolol because of the patient's
   hypotension. She underwent cardioversion on the floor and then was
   transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. In the CCU, she had
   add
l episodes of Afib/RVR, treated by cardioversion once, digoxin
   once, and multiple fluid boluses. Last episode RVR [**4-22**] which resolved
   with fluid boluses. TSH 0.39. MI ruled out with 3 sets of enzymes. HR
   well controlled ranging 80s to 120s, improved from 130s previously. Pt
   complains only of occaissional short lived palpitations
   -continue
 dose Coumadin (2.5mg) restarted y/d INR 1.7 today goal [**3-14**],
   continue to monitor INR
   -amnio loading with amniodorone 400MG TID
   -continue to hold metoprolol (MAPS 68)
   -Getting OOB to chair/BR, get OOB/walking, assess HR response on
   telemetry
   -possible plan for repeat cardioversion this week
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Heart Failure
EF 50%.  Likely related to pt's
   atrial fibrillation. Had been initially diuresed a little but not much
   given RVR and has had multiple fluid boluses. CXR no improvement, still
   evidence of overload on exam. Now with BP
s tolerating would resume
   lasix drip. MAPS 60
s to 70s from 50
s to 60s. Would resume lasix drip
   for gentler diuresis, no big volume changes. UOP has been 80cc/hr
   without lasix gtt. Negative 400cc/24.
   - treat Afib as above
   .lasix drip, goal 500-1L
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Trace AR: Last Echo [**10-18**]
EF 50%
   Can tolerate gentle diuresis.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Pt had a bump in her creatinine in the setting
   of starting lasix. Likely pre-renal. Creatinine improved at 0.9 but
   still above baseline of 0.7.
   -lasix bolus
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - holding metformin and lisinopril
   .
   # Diabetes - On metformin at home.
   - holding metformin for now
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - Not entirely clear on home dose. TSH 0.39.
   - need to clarify home dose and likely decrease dose
   - holding thyroid hormone for now given amniodorone loading
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension
 Normotensive this morning; borderline hypotensive
   overnight.
   - holding lisinopril, as above

   ICU Care
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), aortic stenosis, diastolic heart failure (CHF), and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF). She was admitted from the cardiology clinic for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has been experiencing episodes of AF with RVR, treated with cardioversion once, digoxin once, and multiple fluid boluses. Her heart rate has been well controlled, ranging from 80s to 120s, and she complains only of occasional short-lived palpitations.

The patient has a history of anxiety, acute on chronic heart failure, moderate aortic stenosis (AS), acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Her current medications include amiodarone 400MG TID, Coumadin (warfarin) restarted y/d INR 1.7 today goal [**3-14**], and holding metoprolol (MAPS 68).

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 34.5%, platelet (Plt) count of 256, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 129 mg/dL, and potassium (K+) of 4.5 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal ranges. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 100/62 to 112/87 mmHg, heart rate (HR) ranging from 107 to 120 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals an irregularly irregular heartbeat, 3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium, bibasilar crackles, mild expiratory wheeze, and 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities. The patient is currently not experiencing any symptoms.

The patient's care plan includes continuing amiodarone loading, restarting Coumadin (warfarin), holding metoprolol, and assessing the patient's response to being out of bed (OOB) and walking. The plan also includes a possible repeat cardioversion this week. The patient's acute on chronic heart failure is being treated with a lasix drip for gentler diuresis, no big volume changes. The patient's acute renal failure is being managed with lasix bolus, [**Hospital1 **] lytes, and continued monitoring of creatinine. The patient's diabetes, hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension are"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year-old female with PMHx of DM, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and new
   diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who was admitted from cardiology
   clinic for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial
   fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt arrived on the floor and developed RVR with
   inability to sustain a normal blood pressure. The floor team was
   limited in their use of metoprolol because of the patient's
   hypotension. She underwent cardioversion on the floor and then was
   transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. In the CCU, she had
   add
l episodes of Afib/RVR, treated by cardioversion once, digoxin
   once, and multiple fluid boluses. Last episode RVR [**4-22**] which resolved
   with fluid boluses. TSH 0.39. MI ruled out with 3 sets of enzymes. HR
   well controlled ranging 80s to 120s, improved from 130s previously. Pt
   complains only of occaissional short lived palpitations
   -continue
 dose Coumadin (2.5mg) restarted y/d INR 1.7 today goal [**3-14**],
   continue to monitor INR
   -amnio loading with amniodorone 400MG TID
   -continue to hold metoprolol (MAPS 68)
   -Getting OOB to chair/BR, get OOB/walking, assess HR response on
   telemetry
   -possible plan for repeat cardioversion this week
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Heart Failure
EF 50%.  Likely related to pt's
   atrial fibrillation. Had been initially diuresed a little but not much
   given RVR and has had multiple fluid boluses. CXR no improvement, still
   evidence of overload on exam. Now with BP
s tolerating would resume
   lasix drip. MAPS 60
s to 70s from 50
s to 60s. Would resume lasix drip
   for gentler diuresis, no big volume changes. UOP has been 80cc/hr
   without lasix gtt. Negative 400cc/24.
   - treat Afib as above
   .lasix drip, goal 500-1L
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Trace AR: Last Echo [**10-18**]
EF 50%
   Can tolerate gentle diuresis.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Pt had a bump in her creatinine in the setting
   of starting lasix. Likely pre-renal. Creatinine improved at 0.9 but
   still above baseline of 0.7.
   -lasix bolus
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - holding metformin and lisinopril
   .
   # Diabetes - On metformin at home.
   - holding metformin for now
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - Not entirely clear on home dose. TSH 0.39.
   - need to clarify home dose and likely decrease dose
   - holding thyroid hormone for now given amniodorone loading
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension
 Normotensive this morning; borderline hypotensive
   overnight.
   - holding lisinopril, as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient experienced multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, treated with cardioversion, digoxin, and fluid boluses. Her heart rate is well controlled, ranging from 80s to 120s, improved from previous readings in the 130s. The patient complains of occasional short-lived palpitations.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed RVR and underwent cardioversion on the floor. In the CCU, she received cardioversion, digoxin, and multiple fluid boluses to resolve episodes of Afib/RVR. The last episode resolved with fluid boluses. The patient's heart rate is well controlled, ranging from 80s to 120s, improved from previous readings in the 130s. Continue dose Coumadin (2.5mg) restarted y/d INR 1.7 today goal [**3-14**], and monitor INR. Continue to hold metoprolol (MAPS 68). Get the patient out of bed to a chair/bed, get out of bed/walking, assess HR response on telemetry"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. An ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicating an inferior wall myocardial infarction. The patient was promptly started on aspirin, heparin, and nitroglycerin, and then transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

During the procedure, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). The patient was successfully resuscitated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

In the ICU, the patient has been stable with controlled blood pressure and heart rate. However, the patient continues to experience intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation. The patient's renal function has improved, as indicated by an increase in hemoglobin and creatinine levels. The patient's white blood cell count has slightly increased.

The patient's chest X-ray showed clear lung fields bilaterally without evidence of pulmonary edema. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range. The patient's serum electrolytes are within normal limits, except for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. She was admitted from the cardiology clinic for congestive heart failure exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, treated with cardioversion, digoxin, and fluid boluses. Her heart rate is well-controlled, ranging from the 80s to 120s, and she complains only of occasional short-lived palpitations. The patient's ejection fraction is 50%, and she likely has acute on chronic heart failure due to atrial fibrillation. She has responded well to oral lasix, but still appears to be fluid overloaded on examination. Her renal function has improved, but her creatinine is still above baseline. The patient has diabetes, hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and her medications have been adjusted accordingly. In the ICU, the patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and has multiple lines inserted for various procedures. She is on systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin and prophylaxis for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's code status is full code, and she is planned for transfer to the floor.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year-old female with PMHx of DM, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and new
   diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who was admitted from cardiology
   clinic for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial
   fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt arrived on the floor and developed RVR with
   inability to sustain a normal blood pressure. The floor team was
   limited in their use of metoprolol because of the patient's
   hypotension. She underwent cardioversion on the floor and then was
   transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. In the CCU, she had
   add
l episodes of Afib/RVR, treated by cardioversion once, digoxin
   once, and multiple fluid boluses. Last episode RVR [**4-22**] which resolved
   with fluid boluses. TSH 0.39. MI ruled out with 3 sets of enzymes. HR
   well controlled ranging 80s to 120s, improved from 130s previously. Pt
   complains only of occaissional short lived palpitations
   -continue amio loading
   -increasing Coumadin dose, as pt still subtherapeutic
   -starting lovenox bridge while patient is subtherapeutic
   -possible cardioversion this week, will need TEE first

   # Acute on Chronic Heart Failure
 EF 50%.  Likely related to pt's
   atrial fibrillation.  Pt given PO lasix yesterday with good urine
   response. Still appears to be fluid overloaded on exam.
   - po lasix daily
   - treat Afib as above

   # Acute Renal Failure - Pt had a bump in her creatinine in the setting
   of starting lasix. Likely pre-renal. Creatinine improved at 0.9 but
   still above baseline of 0.7.
   - starting 20 mg PO Lasix daily, as above
   - restarting metformin, as below
   - continue holding lisinoptil

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, aortic stenosis, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted for a heart failure exacerbation and developed new-onset atrial fibrillation. She has been treated with cardioversion, digoxin, and multiple fluid boluses. Her TSH level is 0.39, ruling out myxedema coma as a cause of atrial fibrillation. Her heart rate has been well controlled, ranging from the 80s to 120s, and occasional short-lived palpitations are reported. 

The patient also has acute-on-chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50%, likely related to her atrial fibrillation. She has been given oral Lasix with a good urine response, but still appears to be fluid overloaded on examination. 

Additionally, the patient has moderate aortic stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2) and trace aortic regurgitation, with an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 50%. She can tolerate gentle diuresis.

Furthermore, the patient has developed acute renal failure, with a bump in her creatinine after starting Lasix. Her creatinine has improved to 0.9 but is still above her baseline of 0.7. 

Other conditions include diabetes, hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The patient is restarting metformin and"
