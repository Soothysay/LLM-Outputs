","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hematemesis. The patient underwent an EGD procedure, where a large gastric varix was injected with 2cc and 6cc of contrast material, resulting in bleeding and subsequent hematemesis. The patient's critical condition led to the insertion of a nasogastric (NG) tube, which drained dark blood and clots. The patient's blood pressure transiently dropped to the 80s, and two units of blood were given. The patient was also intubated prior to undergoing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. During TIPS, the initial portosystemic gradient of 22 was reduced to 6 after the procedure. Esophageal varices were seen during TIPS, and a pre-existing splenorenal shunt was observed. There were concerns about slower filling after TIPS, and consideration was given to embolizing this in the future.

Allergies:
The patient has unknown allergies to NSAIDs and acetaminophen.

Medications:
The patient is currently receiving the following medications:
- Octreotide at a rate of 50 mcg/hour
- Propofol at a dose of 60 mcg/kg/min
- Midazolam (Versed) at [**2109-4-25**] 08:30 PM
- Fentanyl at [**2109-4-25**] 08:30 PM
- Pantoprazole (Protonix) at [**2109-4-25**] 10:52 PM

Other ICU medications:
The patient is also receiving other ICU medications, which include ciprofloxacin, last administered on [**2109-4-25**] 06:00 PM.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse. He presented with hematemesis and was found to have esophageal and gastric varices. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. He was also given octreotide and pantoprazole (Protonix) for treatment.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 149/55 mmHg, heart rate of 55 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube ventilation. His temperature is within normal range.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.7, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 77 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, blood glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus are also within normal limits.

The imaging report shows appropriate waveforms and color flow in the hepatic arteries, main portal vein, right anterior and right posterior portal veins, and hepatic veins. However, the left portal vein is not definitively identified, which may be due to portal hypertension. There is also evidence of cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, trace ascites, splen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis, known esophageal and gastric varices, and previous banding. He presented with hematemesis and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with injection of large gastric varix, which temporarily stopped the bleeding. However, the patient continued to bleed through a nasogastric (NG) tube, resulting in a drop in blood pressure. He received one liter of normal saline and two units of blood transfusion. The patient was intubated prior to undergoing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, which successfully lowered the portal hypertension gradient. The patient's current condition is critical, and he is unresponsive to pain. He has a history of alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, chronic back pain, and COPD. His vital signs are unstable, and he requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: The patient's initial presentation was hematemesis due to variceal bleeding. Despite initial success with banding and TIPS, he experienced repeat bleeding. Continuous monitoring and intervention are necessary to control the bleeding and prevent further complications.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and lack of interaction may indicate hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
3. Infection"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for liver failure and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has a history of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, which led to the development of esophageal varices. The patient experienced two episodes of hematemesis, with a total of 200cc of blood loss. An ultrasound was performed, revealing tips in the liver.

The patient has been on various medications, including octreotide, propofol, pantoprazole, and ciprofloxacin. Octreotide is used to reduce portal hypertension and variceal bleeding, while propofol is an anesthetic agent used for sedation. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used to reduce gastric acid production and prevent stress ulcers. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/55 to 132/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 535 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 70, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 16 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, known esophageal and gastric varices, and previous banding of varices. He presented with hematemesis and underwent a redo transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure along with embolization of esophageal varices. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is currently stable, and no further episodes of hematemesis have occurred overnight after the TIPS redo procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis: The patient experienced two episodes of significant hematemesis overnight, which is a potential complication of variceal bleeding. This complication has already been addressed with the TIPS procedure and embolization of varices.
2. Liver dysfunction: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which may lead to liver dysfunction. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and other relevant parameters should be conducted to assess the liver's function and progression.
3. Infection: As the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin), it indicates the possibility of an ongoing or suspected infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate management should be considered.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient is reported to have hypothyroidism but is not currently on levothyroxine. It is important to assess the patient's thyroid function and consider initiating treatment if necessary"

   58 yo M with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol, with known
   esophageal and gastric varices, s/p banding in [**2109-1-27**], who
   presented with hematemesis, now s/p TIPS and embolization of esophageal
   varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Secondary to variceal bleeding.  Two episodes of
   hematemesis overnight.  Liver feels blood is old blood from previous
   variceal bleed. Now s/p EGD and TIPS with embolization of varices.
   Could not evaluate patency of TIPS with ultrasound due to shadowing.
   Hct currently stable, no further episodes of hematemesis overnight
   after TIPS redo IR procedure.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use, known esophageal and gastric varices, who presented with hematemesis. He has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and embolization of esophageal varices. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 157/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with clear lung sounds bilaterally. Physical examination reveals jaundice, distended abdomen, palmar erythema, numerous tattoos, and telangiectasia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can occur due to the patient's cirrhosis and liver dysfunction, leading to altered mental status and neurologic symptoms.

2. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate impaired kidney function, which can be exacerbated by factors such as hypotension or the use of nephrotoxic medications.

3. Respiratory infections: Given the patient's intubation and sedation, there is an increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of variceal bleed. The patient underwent embolization and TIPS procedure last evening. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis of the liver, delirium/confusion, gastric varices, and portal hypertensive gastroopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is on various medications including octreotide, propofol, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's lab results indicate some abnormalities in liver function tests and coagulation parameters. The patient's fluid balance shows a net inflow of 7,194 mL with a total outflow of 6,990 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 set at 50%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient initially presented with variceal bleed, which is a potential complication of portal hypertensive gastroopathy. Although the bleeding seems to have been managed, there is still a risk of rebleeding or ongoing slow bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics, indicating a concern for infection. In the ICU setting, there is an increased risk of developing healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has a history of delirium/confusion"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis of the liver, and portal hypertensive gastroopathy. He presented with a variceal bleed, which was initially treated with TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) and embolization of gastric varices.

The patient remains intubated due to concerns about airway protection. There are plans to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and attempt extubation if the patient's condition allows. Anesthesia will be available on standby in case extubation fails.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/55 mmHg to 172/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. He is on octreotide infusion for variceal bleeding control.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low platelet count (Plt), and abnormal coagulation parameters (PT/PTT/INR). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has a history of delirium/confusion, alcohol abuse, cirrhosis of the liver, and portal hypertensive gastroopathy. He is currently being managed for gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastroopathy, and potential complications related to cirrhosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further bleeding from the var"

   # Hematemesis: Secondary to variceal bleeding.  Now s/p EGD and TIPS
   with embolization of varices.  Could not evaluate patency of TIPS with
   ultrasound due to shadowing.  Hct currently stable, no further episodes
   of hematemesis overnight after TIPS redo IR procedure.
   -continue octreotide gtt, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -active T&S. Transfuse for HCT<25, per liver recs
   -Cipro 400mg IV bid
   -2 large bore PIVs
   -NPO
   -f/u liver recs
   -hold Nadolol and spironolactone in the setting of acute GI bleed
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC 11.9, up from 6.3 two days ago. Afebrile overnight.
   CXR from [**4-27**] shows potential LLL consolidation and patchy opacity at R
   base.  Likely aspirated given NG tube placement and EGD. If becomes
   febrile, consider Levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, who presented with hematemesis. He underwent TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) and embolization of esophageal varices. The patient's hematocrit is currently stable, and there have been no further episodes of hematemesis overnight. He continues to receive octreotide, IV pantoprazole, and antibiotics. The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 6.3 to 11.9, indicating leukocytosis. A chest X-ray shows potential left lower lobe consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base, suggesting aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, COPD, and chronic back pain. He is DNR (do not resuscitate) and his daughter is the care proxy.

Potential medical complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray indicates potential consolidation in the left lower lobe and patchy opacity at the right base. This could be due to aspiration, especially considering the NG tube placement and EGD procedure. If the patient becomes febrile, it may be necessary to consider Levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Variceal bleeding: Although the patient has undergone TIPS and embolization, there is still a risk of rebleeding. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis and known esophageal and gastric varices. He presented with hematemesis and underwent embolization of esophageal varices and TIPS procedure. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he is extubated. He has a history of alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, COPD, and chronic back pain. The patient is DNR/DNI and his daughter is the care proxy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding from esophageal varices: Given the patient's history of variceal bleeding, there is a risk of rebleeding, especially if the embolization was not completely successful or if the TIPS procedure causes portal hypertension to increase again.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction and the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream.
3. Infection: Being in the ICU, the patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows an overall negative balance, indicating potential fluid loss or inadequate fluid replacement. This could lead to dehydration or hypovolemia.
5. electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored, as imbalances"

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120-154/41-71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is receiving octreotide infusion and pantoprazole (Protonix). He is also on multiple other medications. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent development of melanous stools. His fluid balance shows an intake of 1,564 mL (1,009 mL IV fluids) and output of 3,750 mL (including 490 mL blood products), resulting in a negative balance of 2,186 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 488 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, and oxygen saturation maintained at 99%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, HCO3- of 27 mEq/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 260.

Physical examination findings are not assessed in several areas, including peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and some lab values. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, slightly elevated platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated as well.

Assessment and plan include ineffective coping related to history of alcohol abuse, gastric varices, and portal hypertensive gastroopathy. The patient's ICU care involves nutrition support, glycemic control, and multiple lines for access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of multiple melanous stools suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a serious complication in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which is a common concern in critically ill patients.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and confusion upon admission may raise concern for hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver dysfunction.
4. Hypotension: The fluctuating blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which could compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications.
5. Fluid imbalance: The significant negative fluid balance could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, potentially worsening the patient's condition.
6. Respiratory compromise: Although the patient's respiratory support is currently stable, there is a risk of respiratory failure if"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and known esophageal and gastric varices. He presented with hematemesis and underwent an endoscopic procedure (EGD) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with embolization of the varices. The patient is currently stable with no further episodes of hematemesis overnight. However, the patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.9, up from 6.3 two days ago. A chest X-ray from 4/27 shows potential left lower lobe consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base, likely due to aspiration given the nasogastric tube placement and EGD. The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 129/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been extubated and is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient's physical examination reveals no focal neurologic deficits, but peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments are not evaluated. The patient has multiple melanous stools overnight and is currently receiving octreotide, pantoprazole, ciprofloxacin, and other medications as per the assessment and plan. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, hyponatremia, elevated liver enzymes, and other abnormalities. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, COPD, chronic back pain, and is currently DNR/DNI. The patient's daughter is the care proxy. The patient will continue to be monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event, as indicated by the chest X-ray findings, increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of respiratory distress, fever, and worsening oxygenation is essential.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and recent TIPS procedure, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status, personality changes, and altered levels of consciousness is important.
3. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and potential hypoperfusion due to TIPS may predispose him to hepatorenal syndrome. Monitoring for signs of renal dysfunction, such as oliguria, elevated creatinine, and azotemia, is crucial.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has stabilized after the TIPS procedure, there is still a risk of rebleeding. Close monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as melena, hematemesis, and hypotension, is necessary.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and chest X-ray findings suggest a possible infection. Proper infection control measures should be implemented, and close monitoring for signs of sepsis is essential."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and previous banding procedure. He presented with hematemesis and underwent TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) and embolization of esophageal varices. The patient's hemoglobin levels are stable, and there have been no further episodes of hematemesis overnight.

Medical Complications:

1. Hematemesis: The patient initially presented with hematemesis due to variceal bleeding. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and TIPS with embolization of varices. The patient's hemoglobin levels are currently stable, and there have been no further episodes of hematemesis overnight.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 6.3 to 11.9. This could indicate an infection. The patient's chest X-ray shows potential left lower lobe consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base. Aspiration pneumonia is suspected, especially since the patient has a nasogastric tube in place. Treatment for aspiration pneumonia is being considered with antibiotics such as Ceftriaxone and Flagyl. Ciprofloxacin has been discontinued.

3. Alcohol abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse is noted, but it is unclear whether he has experienced delirium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who presented with a gastrointestinal bleed. He has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and intraracial embolization of varices. The patient's current condition is stable after 30 hours, with no significant changes in hemodynamics. However, he is experiencing respiratory distress post-extubation, likely due to aspiration with multifocal infiltrates. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently on nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's family prefers to remove central venous lines, avoid blood transfusions, and maintain a DNR (do not resuscitate)/DNI (do not intubate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleed recurrence: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding, there is a risk of further bleeding episodes.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and aspiration suggest the possibility of worsening respiratory failure, which may require re-intubation.
3. Infection: The presence of multifocal infiltrates raises concerns about the development of pneumonia or other infections.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, especially with fluctuations in"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 72 bpm with a range of 55-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/41 mmHg to 154/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute with a range of 20-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient's weight is currently 73 kg, and his height is 68 inches. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,565 mL and 1,692 mL, with total output of 3,750 mL and 790 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -2,185 mL and 902 mL respectively. 

The patient is receiving octreotide infusion at 50 mcg/hour and pantoprazole (Protonix) via ICU medication. He has allergies to NSAIDs and acetaminophen, and his last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on [**2109-4-28**] at 06:30 AM.

Physical examination reveals the patient lying in bed, agitated, and requiring four-point restraints. He is unable to answer questions but opens his eyes. His chest has coarse breath sounds bilaterally, with diminished sounds at the bases. His abdomen is distended and board-like, and he has trace edema in his extremities. Neurological examination shows agitation, movement of all four extremities, inability to focus or answer questions, and pupils reactive to light.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 5.7 to 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 66 to 95 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 27 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 117 to 138 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including sodium at 140 mEq/L, potassium at 4.1 mEq/L, chloride at 98 mEq/L, and magnesium at 1.8 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include three main points. Firstly, the variceal bleed is now stable for 30 hours, with no significant hemodynamic changes or HCT trends"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old cirrhotic individual who presented with a variceal bleed. The patient underwent TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) and IR embolization for the varices. The patient is currently stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Variceal bleed: Although the patient is currently stable, there is a risk of re-bleeding. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and trends in hematocrit levels will be necessary.

2. Airway protection and mechanical ventilation: The patient remains intubated, and airway protection remains a concern. If no plan for re-intervention is available, the team plans to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and attempt extubation. However, due to the patient's difficult airway, anesthesia standby will be required.

3. ETOH abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and upon extubation, they will be given Ativan on an as-needed basis and CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol) will be used to monitor and manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

4. ICU care: The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values. Nutrition and glycemic control should also be managed appropriately.

5. Lines and prophylaxis: The patient has multiple lines in place, including a 20-gauge"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse. He presented with hematemesis and underwent TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) procedure along with embolization of esophageal varices. The patient's condition remains stable, with no further episodes of hematemesis overnight. His hematocrit (Hct) level is currently stable.

The patient's goals of care are towards comfort, and he is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate). All antibiotics have been discontinued, and no further blood products will be given. The patient will continue to receive lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and known esophageal and gastric varices put him at risk for recurrent bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding is essential.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin to manage hepatic encephalopathy. Regular monitoring of mental status and neurologic function is required.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to chronic liver disease and discontinuation of antibiotics. Regular assessment for signs of infection, such as fever or changes in vital signs, should be performed.
4. Hypogly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, known esophageal and gastric varices, and previous banding procedure. He presented with hematemesis and underwent TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) with embolization of esophageal varices. The patient's current condition is stable, with no further episodes of hematemesis overnight after the redo IR procedure. The patient's goals of care are toward comfort, and further blood products will not be given.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing agitation and encephalopathic symptoms, indicating possible hepatic encephalopathy. This condition should be managed by continuing lactulose and rifaximin as prescribed.
2. Variceal bleeding: Although the patient has undergone TIPS and embolization of esophageal varices, there is still a risk of recurrent bleeding. Close monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of re-bleeding.
3. Infection: Discontinuation of antibiotics may increase the risk of infection, especially in a patient with cirrhosis and compromised immune function. Monitoring for any signs of infection is essential.
4. Hypoglycemia: Patients with cirrhosis and those receiving lactulose may be at risk of hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is important to prevent and manage"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hematemesis. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy. He was previously on multiple antibiotics but they have been discontinued. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 140/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 80%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Physical examination reveals jaundice, distended abdomen, and signs of portal hypertension. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and impaired coagulation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including cirrhosis of the liver, gastric varices, impaired skin integrity, and a history of delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by neuropsychiatric abnormalities caused by liver dysfunction. It can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and even coma if not managed properly.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's initial presentation of hematemesis suggests active bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, possibly due to gastric varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy. Continued bleeding can lead to hypotension, shock, and significant blood loss.
3. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics but they have been discontinued. He is"

","Summary:
The patient presented to the ICU with hematemesis and a history of alcohol abuse. They have been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, gastric varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient's family has decided to discontinue all antibiotics, except for lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have a low oxygen saturation of 80%. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and high bilirubin levels. The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity, delirium, confusion, and a skull fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis puts them at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Discontinuing antibiotics may increase the risk of infection and worsen encephalopathy symptoms.
2. Infection: Stopping all antibiotics could lead to infections, especially considering the patient's compromised immune system due to liver disease.
3. Bleeding: Gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates respiratory distress, which can be exacerbated by their underlying lung condition.
5. Skin breakdown: The history of impaired skin integrity suggests a risk of pressure ulcers or infections.
6. Delirium: The patient's history of delir"
