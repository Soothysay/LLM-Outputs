","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and renal failure who underwent renal transplant in 2005. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and mental status changes, which were likely due to massive volume overload and uremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including CAD with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is most likely due to volume overload. However, other potential causes such as COPD exacerbation or pneumonia should be considered and ruled out. The patient is receiving diuretics (Lasix) to remove excess fluid and improve oxygenation. Oxygen therapy is also being administered via a nasal cannula.

2. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to uremia, which is a buildup of waste products in the blood due to impaired kidney function. Hemodialysis (HD) is recommended for volume removal and uremia management.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG. EKG changes suggest left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with strain in the setting of heart failure. Monitoring cardiac enzymes and considering further evaluation with an echocardiogram are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). He underwent renal transplantation in 2005. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and mental status changes, which were likely due to massive volume overload and uremia.

The patient has been treated with IV lasix to alleviate volume overload and improve respiratory status. His renal function is being closely monitored, and he may require dialysis today for further fluid removal. The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has received a course of levofloxacin.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is most likely due to volume overload and COPD exacerbation. Diuretics will be continued, and if necessary, dialysis may be performed to remove excess fluids. The patient has responded well to lasix IV 40 mg x2.
2. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to uremia. Hemodialysis (HD) is recommended when BUN levels exceed 100. Continued diuresis will be attempted, although there is a risk of worsening mental status. The patient has shown slight improvement over the course of the evening.

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-21**] Events:
   - increased prednisone to 40mg for better COPD coverage
   - renal did UF yesterday
   - ECHO:
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is
   moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate
   hypokinesis of the septum and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
   inferior segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Borderline dilatation of the left ventricle with regional
   LV systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild mitral
   regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-9-10**], wall
   motion abnormalities are probably new (prior echo images were
   suboptimal). Diastolic dysfunction can now be clearly determined. The
   degree of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypernatremia, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient has been on increased prednisone for better COPD coverage, and renal diuresis was performed yesterday. The ECHO reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and increased left ventricular filling pressure. There is also mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient has been receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, metoprolol, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's increased O2 requirements overnight and crackles on the right side indicate a possible deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Cardiac complications: The ECHO shows signs of left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to further cardiac issues such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and increased white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection.
4. Renal impairment: The patient's history of hypernatremia and the use of diuretics indicate a potential risk for renal dysfunction.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and increased risk of clot formation may predispose him to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism ("

   - increased prednisone to 40mg for better COPD coverage
   - renal did UF yesterday
   - ECHO:
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is
   moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate
   hypokinesis of the septum and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
   inferior segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Borderline dilatation of the left ventricle with regional
   LV systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild mitral
   regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-9-10**], wall
   motion abnormalities are probably new (prior echo images were
   suboptimal). Diastolic dysfunction can now be clearly determined. The
   degree of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly.

   # Hypoxia: Most likely due to volume overload, COPD exacerbation, but
   no sign of  PNA.
   - responded well to lasix IV 40 mg x2, continue diuresis
   - renal following, possible dialysis today for more fluid removal,

   - for COPD exacerbation, now s/p levoflox course, would lengthen
   steroid course as is still wheezy

   # MS changes: Most likely due to uremia
   - recommend HD for BUN >100
   - will attempt continued diuresis though risk of worsening MS
   - has improved slightly over the course of the evening

   # CAD/ST depressions: Pt with h/o CAD s/p CABG. However, given absence
   of CP and normal cardiac enzymes, suspect that EKG changes likely LVH
   with strain in setting of heart failure.
   - cont afterload reduction for greater forward flow (which is also
   improving creatinine) with imdur and hydralazine
   - CEs negative, ST depressions chronic
   - no need for heparin gtt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) who underwent renal transplant in 2005. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and mental status changes, which were believed to be due to massive volume overload and uremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is most likely due to volume overload and COPD exacerbation. The patient responded well to lasix IV 40 mg x2, and diuresis should be continued. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes are most likely due to uremia. Hemodialysis (HD) is recommended for BUN >100. Continued diuresis should be attempted, although there is a risk of worsening mental status.
3. CAD/ST depressions: The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG. EKG changes may be attributed to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with strain in the setting of heart failure. Afterload reduction with imdur and hydralazine should be continued.
4. CHF: The patient has a reported ejection fraction of 35-40% and known CAD. Diuretics should be continued, and after"

   # Hypoxia: Most likely due to volume overload, COPD exacerbation, but
   no sign of  PNA.
   - responded well to lasix IV 40 mg x2, continue diuresis
   - renal following, possible dialysis today for more fluid removal,

   - for COPD exacerbation, now s/p levoflox course, would lengthen
   steroid course as is still wheezy

   - recommend HD for BUN >100
   - will attempt continued diuresis though risk of worsening MS
   - has improved slightly over the course of the evening
   .
   # CAD/ST depressions: Pt with h/o CAD s/p CABG. However, given absence
   of CP and normal cardiac enzymes, suspect that EKG changes likely LVH
   with strain in setting of heart failure.
   - cont afterload reduction for greater forward flow (which is also
   improving creatinine) with imdur and hydralazine
   - CEs negative, ST depressions chronic
   - no need for heparin gtt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) who underwent renal transplantation in 2005. He presented to the ICU with hypoxia and mental status changes, likely due to massive volume overload and uremia.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and other medications as listed. He has allergies to sporran, ace inhibitors, angioedema, and penicillins. 

On physical examination, the patient appears distracted, oriented but slow to respond, and has normal mental status. He has elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) at 5 cm while sitting at a 90-degree angle, crackles/inspiratory rales tracking up half of the posterior lung field on the right side, and no wheezes. His cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm (RRR) with a soft grade 3 systolic ejection murmur over the right upper sternal border (RUSB) and a second murmur over the left sternal border (LSB) that is more holosystolic grade 2-3/6. There is no gallop. 

Laboratory findings include"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-21**] Events:
   - increased prednisone to 40mg for better COPD coverage
   - renal did UF yesterday
   - ECHO:
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is
   moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate
   hypokinesis of the septum and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
   inferior segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Borderline dilatation of the left ventricle with regional
   LV systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild mitral
   regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-9-10**], wall
   motion abnormalities are probably new (prior echo images were
   suboptimal). Diastolic dysfunction can now be clearly determined. The
   degree of mitral regurgitation has increased slightly.
   - R sided CP in PM -> EKG stable, CEs flat (likely neuropathic, pt had
   been off of fentanyl patch)
   - increasing O2 requirements overnight (high flow 50%, 5L NC),
   increased crackles R side -> lasix 40mg IV
