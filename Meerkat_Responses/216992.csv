","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple recent intubations following episodes of flash pulmonary edema, significant cardiac history including CABG, VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia), and other medical conditions.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has had several interventions and treatments aimed at managing his hypoxic respiratory failure, fluid overload, urinary tract infection (UTI), coronary artery disease (CAD), rhythm disturbances, blood pressure issues, leg ulcer, coagulation problems, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis C, and hypothyroidism.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Fluid overload: The patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of well-known systolic CHF (ejection fraction 20%). This can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms, pulmonary edema, and potential kidney dysfunction.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella indicates a bacterial infection. If left untreated or not properly managed, this can lead to a severe UTI, sepsis, and kidney infection.

4. Coronary artery disease ("

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and CCU admissions. This indicates a possible underlying respiratory condition that needs to be addressed.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG surgery. The recent catheterization showed diastolic dysfunction but no interventions were performed. The patient's current condition includes diuresis with lasix gtt, nitro gtt to control pressures, and monitoring for ACS or PE.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is positive for ESBL Klebsiella. This indicates an active infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered to treat it. Condom catheterization may also be necessary to monitor intake and output.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has known CAD and has undergone CABG surgery. Recent catheterization showed 2VD and patent LIMA to LAD. It is important to continue monitoring cardiac biomarkers and continue antiplatelet therapy with ASA and statin.

5. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has a history of VF arrest and had an AICD placed but was removed due to recurrent infections. Currently, the patient is in sinus rhythm but should be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a known case of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which is likely the cause of their hypoxic respiratory failure. Other potential causes, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE), are less likely given the patient's history and unchanged ECGs.

The patient has undergone various interventions and treatments, including diuresis with Lasix to manage fluid overload, nitroglycerin titrated to maintain systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, and weaning off ventilator support as tolerated. Serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECGs have been ordered to rule out ACS.

The patient also has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) with a positive urine culture for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella. A condom catheter has been placed to monitor intake and output, and the patient will continue on meropenem.

Additionally, the patient has known coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with recent catheterization showing two-vessel disease and a patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF
   schedule)).
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:
   - Not going to replete K as starting spironolocatone
   - Check 3pm electrolytes

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple ICU and CCU admissions, with this episode consistent with prior episodes of flash pulmonary edema. Other potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history and unchanged ECGs and supratherapeutic INR. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on invasive ventilation support.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose, and elevated creatinine level. The patient also has an elevated INR and troponin-T levels within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology, other potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history and unchanged ECGs and supratherapeutic INR.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF
   schedule)).
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:
   - Not going to replete K as starting spironolocatone
   - Check 3pm electrolytes

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema

   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.

   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of chronic health conditions, including congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, chest pain, and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on invasive ventilation support but has been successfully extubated. The patient's right foot is sore, and he experiences sharp intermittent pain in the left inferior rib region.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during previous ICU admissions. This episode is consistent with prior episodes, but other potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's history, unchanged ECGs, and supratherapeutic INR suggest that ACS or PE are less likely.
2. UTI: The patient's urine culture is positive for ESBL Klebsiella, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). Appropriate measures should be taken to treat this infection.
3. CHF exacerbation: The patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of well-known systolic CHF. He has had significant diuresis during this stay, with a net"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema

   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB

   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.

   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient

   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF
   schedule)).
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today

","The patient in the ICU has a complex medical history and is currently experiencing multiple health issues. Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during previous ICU admissions. The recent episode of hypoxic respiratory failure is consistent with prior episodes.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg, heart rate of 64 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 36.4°C (97.6°F). The patient's weight is currently 109.4 kg, which is the same as their admission weight.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flow sheet data indicates that the patient has received various medications including furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and meropenem.

The patient's physical examination reveals a harsh systolic murmur that blurs into the second heart sound. The murmur is auscultated throughout the left upper chest and even heard in the epigastric region, with the loudest volume at the right upper sternal border. The patient also has mild rales at the left posterior base. The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema, with a bandaged right foot.

He presented with acute decompensated CHF, hypoxic respiratory failure, and urinary tract infection (UTI) due to an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 90/44 to 76/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram (ECG).

Physical examination reveals a harsh systolic murmur that blurs into the second heart sound, clear lung sounds bilaterally with good air exchange, bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities, chronic venous stasis changes in the right leg, and an amputated left leg.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as a prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR). The tro"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Stop lasix drip
   - Restart home dose of torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema, will plan to increase to 25 TID on [**9-24**].
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Decrease ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  Coumadin re-started yesterday, on Heparin drip.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft)
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   -continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - D/C Percocet
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Re-start Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:  Repleted with small amt of K given lasix gtt and
   decline in K.  Expect to stabilize with discontinuation of lasix gtt
   and spironolactone.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF
   schedule)).
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:
   - Not going to replete K as starting spironolocatone
   - Check 3pm electrolytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been on multiple medications, including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and anticoagulants. He also has a urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure running in the low 80s and high 70s. His pain in the right foot is being managed with additional pain medication. The patient's electrolytes and renal function are being closely monitored, and he is expected to be transitioned to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and systolic heart failure increases the risk of recurrent episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture for ESBL-producing Klebsiella, indicating a significant UTI. This can lead to worsening symptoms and potential kidney damage if not treated promptly and appropriately.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, and diastolic dysfunction puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding risk: The"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a removed implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and chronic kidney disease. He presented with flash pulmonary edema and was intubated. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various cardiac issues.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His current medications include furosemide, famotidine, and meropenem.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for right foot pain. He complains of no shortness of breath or chest pain. His physical examination reveals a harsh systolic murmur that blurs into the second heart sound, clear lung sounds with good air exchange, bilateral lower extremity edema, and chronic venous stasis changes in the right leg.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 317 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, sodium of 132 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 98 mEq/L, glucose of 296 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 34"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Stop lasix drip
   - Restart home dose of torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema, will plan to increase to 25 TID on [**9-24**].
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Decrease ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  Coumadin re-started yesterday, on Heparin drip.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft)
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   -continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - D/C Percocet
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Re-start Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:  Repleted with small amt of K given lasix gtt and
   decline in K.  Expect to stabilize with discontinuation of lasix gtt
   and spironolactone.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20%), known coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) removal due to recurrent bloodstream infections, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 3, and hepatitis C infection.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient also presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of his well-known systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He has been diuresing well with lasix and will continue to be diuresed with lasix and start spironolactone today.

The patient has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) with a positive urine culture for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella. He will be placed on condom catheter to monitor his intake and output. Meropenem will be continued for a 14-day course.

Other medical issues include constipation, right lower extremity ulcer, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipid"

   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple ICU admissions, including for flash pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease with previous CABG, and chronic venous stasis changes in the right leg. He presented with fluid overload and an exacerbation of known systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient has been successfully extubated and is currently tolerating systemic blood pressures in the 80s. He complains of pain in the right foot and has been asking for additional Percocet. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/44 mmHg to 76/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels, except for hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during previous ICU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology, other potential causes such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE) should be considered.
2. UTI: The patient's urine culture is positive for ESBL Klebsiella."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of multiple ICU admissions, known systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been experiencing episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation.
- The patient's current condition includes fluid overload, diuresis, hypotension, and a known right foot sore.
- The patient has an active urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by ESBL Klebsiella.
- The patient is on multiple medications including diuretics, beta-blockers, statins, anticoagulants, antibiotics, and pain management.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and prolonged INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of flash pulmonary edema, which can lead to repeated episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure. This condition requires close monitoring and management of fluid balance and cardiac function.
2. Fluid overload: The patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbating pre-existing systolic CHF. Continued diuresis is necessary to manage fluid balance and prevent further complications related to fluid overload.
3. Systolic CHF: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1 L out today
   - Increase spironolactone  to 25mg daily
   - Continue torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Increase Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic on
   exam.
   -Continue to diurese, with spironolcatone and torsemide, goal 1L out
   today

   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  INR 2.4 so continue coumadin, on Heparin drip until
   therapeutic.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip until INR therapeutic
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.4.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt until therapeutic with coumadin
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1 L out today
   - Increase spironolactone  to 25mg daily
   - Continue torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Increase Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic on
   exam.
   -Continue to diurese, with spironolcatone and torsemide, goal 1L out
   today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  INR 2.4 so continue coumadin, on Heparin drip until
   therapeutic.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip until INR therapeutic
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.4.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt until therapeutic with coumadin
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor yesterday ([**9-24**]).
   - Goal: 2 L out today, as long as tolerated by BP
   - Continue spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lasix drip (currently at 12 mg/hour, titrate as needed to diurese to
   goal)
   - Follow K [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete so on the order closer
   to/greater than 4.5 goal
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Hold Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed while diuresing
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, attempt to wean as appropriate
   - Hope to extubated tomorrow morning after another 24 hours of strong
   diuresis
   - Prepare for Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again yesterday.
   -Continue to diurese, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, combined with diuresis.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-poing
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam
   - Check afternoon Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 3.3
   - Continue heparin drip; hold on re-starting coumadin (although INR
   therapeutic, hold on starting coumadin as prepare for Swan procedure
   Monday 10/5/9)
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 u qhs
   had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u qhs
   today
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor yesterday ([**9-24**]).
   - Goal: 1-2 L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Continue torsemide
   - Lasix drip (currently at 12 mg/hour, titrate as needed to diurese to
   goal)
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, attempt to wean as appropriate
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again yesterday.
   -Continue to diurese, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-poing
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source on exam
   - Check afternoon Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 3.3
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   - Can discontinue heparin drip now that INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 u qhs
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

","The patient is a 109-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, and hepatitis C. He presented with foot/leg pain and was found to have flash pulmonary edema, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current medications include spironolactone, torsemide, Lasix drip, amytriptyline, Isordil, aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and statins. He also has a central venous catheter (PICC line), arterial line, and urinary catheter in place.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated troponin-T level, prolonged QT interval, and electrolyte imbalances. His blood cultures are positive for ESBL-producing Klebsiella.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, pump failure exacerbation of known systolic CHF, coronary artery disease with diastolic dysfunction, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The plan includes continuing diuretics, monitoring fluid balance, and managing blood pressure, among other interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of CHF, further episodes of flash pulmonary edema, development of deep vein"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, diastolic dysfunction, coronary artery disease post-cabg, and known ventricular fibrillation arrest with icd removal. The patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of well-known systolic CHF and diastolic dysfunction. He has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and CCU admissions. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, pump failure, coronary artery disease, rhythm disturbances, urinary tract infection, constipation, anemia, right leg ulcer, atrioventricular rhythm, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis C, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently intubated and ventilated, awaiting possible extubation today. He is on various medications including furosemide, heparin, meropenem, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pump failure: The patient's fluid overload and history of systolic heart failure suggest that there may be ongoing pump failure. This can result in worsening heart failure symptoms, fluid retention, and potential cardiogenic shock.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient's known CAD"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor [**9-24**], awaiting
   potential extubation today.  Believe pt currently euvolemic, will
   attempt to maintain pre-load at current state and decrease afterload
   with up-titrating doses of Captopril.
   - Initiate Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Consider decreasing Isordil if needed for BP as afterload is reduced
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate, d/c Lasix drip
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, anticipate extubation today
   - Anticipate Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with initiation of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Hct stable at ~22 following
   recent decrease in Hct, no evidence of bleeding.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.6.
   - Hold Coumadin as INR supratherapeutic, particularly in anticipation
   of Swan Monday [**2178-9-28**]
   - Continue heparin drip
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Nutriton: Nutrition consult re: OG feeding

","The patient's medical progress note indicates that they are currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and have a history of systolic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. They also have known coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). 

The patient's current medications include furosemide, heparin sodium, captopril, isordil, spironolactone, amytriptyline, meropenem, and atorvastatin. They are also on insulin glargine for glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg, heart rate of 63 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and a temperature of 36.5°C. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal ranges. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with radiation throughout the precordium, clear to auscultation anteriorly, soft abdomen, and 1+ edema in the right leg.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   [**Male First Name (un) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema, requiring
   intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor [**9-24**], awaiting
   potential extubation today.  Believe pt currently euvolemic, will
   attempt to maintain pre-load at current state and decrease afterload
   with up-titrating doses of Captopril.
   - Initiate Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Consider decreasing Isordil if needed for BP as afterload is reduced
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate, d/c Lasix drip
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, anticipate extubation today
   - Anticipate Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with initiation of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Hct stable at ~22 following
   recent decrease in Hct, no evidence of bleeding.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.6.
   - Hold Coumadin as INR supratherapeutic, particularly in anticipation
   of Swan Monday [**2178-9-28**]
   - Continue heparin drip
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

   Disposition: CCU care
","The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple recent intubations following episodes of flash pulmonary edema, significant cardiac history including CABG, and a previous ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) placement that was removed due to bacteremia. The patient recently had another episode of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation, and is now extubated and comfortable.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE), although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has known coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and recent catheterization showed 2-vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions performed. The patient also has a history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (EF 20%), diastolic dysfunction, known CAD s/p CABG, VF arrest with AICD removal, hypertension, chronic anemia, HCV, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and DM2. He presented with fluid overload and flash pulmonary edema. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. He has been started on carvedilol, Lasix, and spironolactone for heart failure management. His current medications include captopril, isordil, ASA 81mg daily, statin, and meropenem for a UTI caused by ESBL Klebsiella. The patient's blood pressure is tolerating SBPs in the 80s, with a goal SBP < 130. His Hct dropped by 4 points yesterday but has stabilized overnight. There is no evidence of bleeding. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic at 4.6, and heparin drip will be continued. Glargine dose was halved due to NPO status and recent hypoglycemic episode. Atorvastatin will continue for hyperlipidemia. Hep C treatment will be reassessed if the patient continues to improve. The patient's code status is full, and he will receive CCU care.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   [**Male First Name (un) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema, requiring
   intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling BPs and PE
   triggers.
   - Continue Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Place swan today
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with initiation of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on [**9-24**] that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no obvious
   bleeding source found on exam.  Given that his hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that crit of 27.3 was likely a spurious
   result.
   - Continue to follow hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.8.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, will restart when INR is in therapeutic
   range
   - Continue heparin drip, will need to titrated down due to elevated PTT
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Nutriton: Nutrition consult re: OG feeding

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   [**Male First Name (un) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema, requiring
   intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling BPs and PE
   triggers.
   - Continue Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Place swan today
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on [**9-24**] that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no obvious
   bleeding source found on exam.  Given that his hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that crit of 27.3 was likely a spurious
   result.
   - Continue to follow hct
   - f/u Retic count
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.8.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, will restart when INR is in therapeutic
   range
   - Continue heparin drip, will need to titrated down due to elevated PTT
   - f/u INR tonight at 7pm
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Nutriton: Nutrition consult re: OG feeding

","The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a significant cardiac history including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and ventricular fibrillation arrest, for which an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was placed but later removed due to bacteremia. He has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/48 mmHg to 102/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on aerosol-cool face tent with CPAP/PSV ventilation, and pulse oximetry reading of 97%. 

The patient has been extubated and is alert and oriented, with a general physical examination showing a systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with radiation throughout the precordium. His lungs are clear anteriorly, and he has 1+ edema in his right leg with a bandaged right foot. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL, sodium of 160 mg/dL, potassium of 1.1 mg/dL, chloride of 32 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.2 mg/dL, phosphorus of 3.7 mg"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple recent intubations following episodes of flash pulmonary edema and significant cardiac history including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He has also had a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) placement removed due to bacteremia. The patient recently experienced another episode of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation, but is now extubated and comfortable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. Other potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE), although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.

2. Pump failure: The patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of well-known systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Despite significant diuresis during this stay, the patient had flash pulmonary edema again yesterday.

3. Coronaries: The patient has known coronary artery disease (CAD) status post CABG. Recent catheterization showed 2-vessel disease, patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions performed. Previous episodes of chest pain did not seem to be cardiac in origin.

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr

   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of flash pulmonary edema. He has significant cardiac history including CABG and a history of VF arrest with AICD removal due to recurrent bloodstream infections. The patient recently had another episode of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation, but is now extubated and comfortable.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. This indicates a possible underlying respiratory condition that may lead to hypoxic respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a known history of CAD s/p CABG and diastolic dysfunction. He also had a VF arrest with AICD placement removal. These cardiac issues can potentially lead to further complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is positive for ESBL Klebsiella. This indicates an active UTI infection, which can be a source of concern and should be treated appropriately to prevent any complications related to the urinary tract.

4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, and an aggressive bowel regimen is being continued. Constipation can lead to complications such as impaction, discomfort, and increased risk of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, Heparin
   d/c
ed recently.
   - INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

   TITLE:    ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] today and I concur with
   the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment plan.  Mr.
   [**Known lastname 10165**] is well known to the CCU due to a prolonged hospitalization
   complicated by recurrent requirements for intubation for flash
   pulmonary edema.  It is felt that these episodes result from changes in
   the systolic BP (to 140-160 mmHg).
   Over the past 24 hours, he has continued to diurese 1-2 L per day.  His
   capropril has been increased to 50 mg tid and he is tolerating this
   with BPs in the high 90s and low 100s.
   He remains symptomatically much improved
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of flash pulmonary edema, significant cardiac history including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) removal due to bacteremia, and another episode of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. The patient is now extubated and comfortable.

The patient has had multiple admissions to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and coronary care unit (CCU), and he is known to have systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% and diastolic dysfunction. The patient's recent cardiac catheterization showed two-vessel disease, patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD), and diastolic dysfunction without any interventions performed.

The patient is currently on several medications, including captopril for afterload reduction, spironolactone, lasix (furosemide) for diuresis, amytriptyline for anxiety, ativan for anxiety as needed, and a combination of aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin for his cardiac condition.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin concentration, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and elevated troponin-T levels. His blood glucose levels have"

   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction

   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with multiple recent intubations due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema. He has a significant cardiac history including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, which was later removed due to bacteremia. The patient recently experienced another episode of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation, and he is now extubated and comfortable.

The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and diastolic dysfunction. He presented with fluid overload and has undergone significant diuresis during this stay. The goal is to keep his fluid balance even and avoid negative fluid balance.

He has known coronary artery disease (CAD) post CABG and recent cardiac catheterization showed 2-vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery and diastolic dysfunction. No interventions were performed.

The patient has a history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections. He is currently in sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction.

His blood pressure has been tolerating systolic blood pressures (SBPs) in the 80s. The goal is to maintain SBP < 100. Anti-hypertensive regimen includes uptitration of captopril for"

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate; on lasix gtt at
   10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.8.  On Coumadin, Heparin
   d/c
ed recently.
   - On Coumadin re-started yesterday, INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema, significant cardiac history including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) placement, and bacteremia leading to AICD removal.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has had multiple intubations. Currently, he is extubated and comfortable. The patient's main concerns include hypoxic respiratory failure, fluid overload, coronary artery disease, rhythm disturbances, hypertension, urinary tract infection, constipation, anemia, right leg ulcer, and several chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hepatic cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism.

The assessment and plan section highlights the following issues:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. The likely cause is hypoxic respiratory failure, although other potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Fluid overload: The patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of well-known systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction. Aggressive diuresis has been initiated, aiming to keep a negative fluid balance of (-)500cc/day.
3. Coronaries: The patient has known coronary"

   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple recent intubations following episodes of flash pulmonary edema, significant cardiac history including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and bacteremia. The patient recently had another episode of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation and is now extubated and comfortable. The main focus at this time is controlling blood pressures and pulmonary edema triggers. The patient's current medications include Captopril, Spironolactone, Lasix, Amytriptyline, Ativan, and an aggressive bowel regimen.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. This indicates a potential for recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of significant systolic and diastolic heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post CABG, and VF arrest. There may be ongoing concerns related to his cardiac function.
3. Diuresis: The patient has undergone significant diuresis this stay and appears euvolemic with a goal to keep (-)500cc/day. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is necessary.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase"

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, will hold lasix gtt for now and bolus diuril as needed
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -diuril boluses to maintain Is and Os at goal
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, will likely continue captopril as
   outpatient
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high nl when adjusted for low crit.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, at half home
   dose
   - increase coumadin dose to home dose of  5mg
   -restart heparin gtt until therapeutic on warfarin
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

   TITLE:    ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6984**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan. The physical examination documented above is consistent
   with mine today.   Mr. [**Known lastname 10165**] is well known to the CCU due to a
   prolonged hospitalization complicated by recurrent requirements for
   intubation for flash pulmonary edema.  It is felt that these episodes
   result from changes in the systolic BP (to 140-160 mmHg).
   Over the past 24 hours, his diuresis has continued, but he has had
   hypotension with a systolic BP ranging between 60-80 systolic for most
   of the day.  Although his is asymptomatic, we will lower his captopril
   to 37.5 mg tid to allow him a slightly higher systolic BP.
   He remains symptomatically improved without episodes of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, will hold lasix gtt for now and bolus diuril as needed
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -diuril boluses to maintain Is and Os at goal
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, will likely continue captopril as
   outpatient
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high nl when adjusted for low crit.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, at half home
   dose
   - increase coumadin dose to home dose of  5mg
   -restart heparin gtt until therapeutic on warfarin
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, aortic valve replacement (AVR), and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation. The patient is currently extubated and comfortable.

The patient has several medical conditions that need to be addressed:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. It is likely hypoxic respiratory failure, but other potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Blood pressure control: The goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema. The patient's blood pressure has been controlled with medications such as captopril and spironolactone.
3. Fluid overload: The patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbating known systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction. Diuretics will be used to manage this condition.
4. Coronaries: The patient has known coronary artery disease (CAD) status post CABG. Recent catheterization showed 2-vessel disease, with a patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery. No interventions were performed.

   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   AVR, hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Patient now extubated and breathing comfortably.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, atrioventricular valve replacement (AVR), and ventricular fibrillation arrest with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement that was later removed due to bacteremia. The patient has been admitted multiple times to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and coronary care unit (CCU) for episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which may be related to hypoxic respiratory failure, anxiety, or other potential etiologies such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has undergone significant diuresis to manage fluid overload and is currently extubated and breathing comfortably. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation, suggesting ongoing risk for hypoxic respiratory failure. This may be due to various factors including cardiac dysfunction, ACS, or PE.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% and diastolic dysfunction. There is ongoing concern for exacerbation of cardiac dysfunction and the need for careful monitoring and management of fluid balance, blood pressure, and medication regimen.
3. Bacteremia and infection: The patient had an ICD removed due to bacteremia, indicating a previous infection. Current medications include"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple recent intubations due to flash pulmonary edema, significant cardiac history including CABG, AVR, and VF arrest. He was previously on AICD but it was removed due to bacteremia. The patient is now extubated and comfortable. His main focus is controlling blood pressure and preventing flash pulmonary edema. He has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, systolic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction, coronary artery disease post CABG, rhythm disturbances, urinary tract infection, anemia, and a surgical wound on his right leg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. This suggests a potential for recurrent episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Systolic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction: The patient has a known systolic ejection fraction of 20% and diastolic dysfunction. This indicates a risk for worsening heart failure symptoms.
3. Coronary artery disease post CABG: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone CABG surgery. There is a possibility of recurrent angina or further cardiac events.
4. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has a history of VF arrest and AICD placement. Monitoring on telemetry will be important to detect any rhythm disturbances.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is positive for"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   AVR, hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Patient now extubated and breathing comfortably.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Yesterday, Captopril decreased from 50mg tid to 37.5mg tid, for
   afterload reduction, d/t lower BP
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - increase torsemide to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - start metolazone 5mg [**Hospital1 **] po
   - Goal I/O negative 1L (yesterday was positive 700mL), will hold lasix
   gtt for now and bolus diuril as needed later today to meet diuresis
   needs (was given 500mg PO chlorothiazide yesterday evening)
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing (K repleted this morning)
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, but was positive 700mL yesterday.
   -Diuril boluses prn to maintain Is and Os at goal; goal 1L negative
   today
   -Other diuretic changes/types listed above under hypoxic respiratory
   failure plan
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed. No active chest pain.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5.  INR today not at goal.
   - give 10mg coumadin today, then resume 5mg daily coumadin
   - continue heparin gtt until therapeutic on warfarin
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high nl when adjusted for low crit. Hct stable this AM.
   - check daily Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   - confirm weight-bearing status of the foot with vascular
   .
   # DM 2:
   -glargine at bedtime
   -humalong SS
   -diabetic diet
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate

   TITLE:    ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan. The physical examination documented above is consistent
   with mine today.   Mr. [**Known lastname 10165**] is well known to the CCU due to a
   prolonged hospitalization complicated by recurrent requirements for
   intubation for flash pulmonary edema.  It is felt that these episodes
   result from changes in the systolic BP (to 140-160 mmHg).
   Over the past 24 hours, his diuresis has continued. His BP is improved
   to 108-110 systolic on the lower dosage of captopril 37.5 mg tid.
   He remains symptomatically improved without episodes of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multiple recent intubations due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema, significant cardiac history including CABG, AVR, and VF arrest after AICD placement. He was admitted with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of well-known systolic CHF and diastolic dysfunction. The patient has been diuresed significantly this stay but was positive 700mL yesterday. He is currently extubated and breathing comfortably.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. The main focus at this time is controlling blood pressures and PE triggers to prevent further episodes of flash pulmonary edema.
2. Coronaries: The patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD, patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions performed. No active chest pain.
3. Rhythm: The patient has a history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections. He is currently in sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction. Monitoring on telemetry.
4. Blood pressure: The patient is tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100. Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
5. AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today not at goal. Give 10mg"
